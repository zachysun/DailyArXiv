| **[Joint parameter and state estimation for regularized time-discrete multibody dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06599v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06599v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a method for offline parameter estimation of discrete multibody dynamics with regularized and frictional kinematic constraints. This setting leads to unobserved degrees of freedom, which we handle using joint state and parameter estimation. Our method finds the states and parameters as the solution to a nonlinear least squares optimization problem based on the inverse dynamics and the observation error. The solution is found using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with derivatives from automatic differentiation and custom differentiation rules for the complementary conditions that appear due to dry frictional constraints. We reduce the number of method parameters to the choice of the time-step, regularization coefficients, and a parameter that controls the relative weighting of inverse dynamics and observation errors. We evaluate the method using synthetic and real measured data, focusing on performance and sensitivity to method parameters. In particular, we optimize over a 13-dimensional parameter space, including inertial, frictional, tilt, and motor parameters, using data from a real Furuta pendulum. Results show fast convergence, in the order of seconds, and good agreement for different time-series of recorded data over multiple method parameter choices. However, very stiff constraints may cause difficulties in solving the optimization problem. We conclude that our method can be very fast and has method parameters that are robust and easy to set in the tested scenarios.</p></details> | 49 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets for Time-series Joint Alignment and Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06591v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06591v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment remains a pivotal challenge that forestalls even simple averaging. Since its introduction, the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), which we first introduced (Weber et al., 2019) and further developed in (Weber & Freifeld, 2023), has proven itself as an effective solution for this problem (these conference papers are earlier partial versions of the current manuscript). DTAN predicts and applies diffeomorphic transformations in an input-dependent manner, thus facilitating the joint alignment (JA) and averaging of time-series ensembles in an unsupervised or a weakly-supervised manner. The inherent challenges of the weakly/unsupervised setting, particularly the risk of trivial solutions through excessive signal distortion, are mitigated using either one of two distinct strategies: 1) a regularization term for warps; 2) using the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE). The latter is a novel, regularization-free approach which also facilitates the JA of variable-length signals. We also further extend our framework to incorporate multi-task learning (MT-DTAN), enabling simultaneous time-series alignment and classification. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different backbone architectures, demonstrating their efficacy in time-series alignment tasks. Finally, we showcase the utility of our approach in enabling Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for misaligned time-series data. Extensive experiments across 128 UCR datasets validate the superiority of our approach over contemporary averaging methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, marking a significant advancement in the field of time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript covers and extends the papers: Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (DTAN; NeruIPS 2019) and Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (ICML 2023).

| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning based Triggering Function for Early Classifiers of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06584v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06584v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) has been recognized as an important problem in many areas where decisions have to be taken as soon as possible, before the full data availability, while time pressure increases. Numerous ECTS approaches have been proposed, based on different triggering functions, each taking into account various pieces of information related to the incoming time series and/or the output of a classifier. Although their performances have been empirically compared in the literature, no studies have been carried out on the optimality of these triggering functions that involve ``man-tailored'' decision rules. Based on the same information, could there be better triggering functions? This paper presents one way to investigate this question by showing first how to translate ECTS problems into Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, where the very same information is used in the state space. A thorough comparison of the performance obtained by ``handmade'' approaches and their ``RL-based'' counterparts has been carried out. A second question investigated in this paper is whether a different combination of information, defining the state space in RL systems, can achieve even better performance. Experiments show that the system we describe, called \textsc{Alert}, significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors on a large number of datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245v2)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03245v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Time Series Forecasting: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Guided by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v2)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.06282v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data. To address this, we present a pilot study on using reinforcement learning (RL) for time series data augmentation. Our method, ReAugment, tackles three critical questions: which parts of the training set should be augmented, how the augmentation should be performed, and what advantages RL brings to the process. Specifically, our approach maintains a forecasting model zoo, and by measuring prediction diversity across the models, we identify samples with higher probabilities for overfitting and use them as the anchor points for augmentation. Leveraging RL, our method adaptively transforms the overfit-prone samples into new data that not only enhances training set diversity but also directs the augmented data to target regions where the forecasting models are prone to overfitting. We validate the effectiveness of ReAugment across a wide range of base models, showing its advantages in both standard time series forecasting and few-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06380v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Informative representations enhance model performance and generalisability in downstream tasks. However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409v3)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11409v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |
| **[Powerformer: A Transformer with Weighted Causal Attention for Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06151v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06151v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently shown strong performance in time-series forecasting, but their all-to-all attention mechanism overlooks the (temporal) causal and often (temporally) local nature of data. We introduce Powerformer, a novel Transformer variant that replaces noncausal attention weights with causal weights that are reweighted according to a smooth heavy-tailed decay. This simple yet effective modification endows the model with an inductive bias favoring temporally local dependencies, while still allowing sufficient flexibility to learn the unique correlation structure of each dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate that Powerformer not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public time-series benchmarks, but also that it offers improved interpretability of attention patterns. Our analyses show that the model's locality bias is amplified during training, demonstrating an interplay between time-series data and power-law-based attention. These findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modifications to the Transformer architecture for time-series forecasting, and they establish Powerformer as a strong, efficient, and principled baseline for future research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Sequence and Image Modeling in Irregular Medical Time Series Through Self-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06134v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06134v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series are often irregular and face significant missingness, posing challenges for data analysis and clinical decision-making. Existing methods typically adopt a single modeling perspective, either treating series data as sequences or transforming them into image representations for further classification. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework that incorporates both sequence and image representations. We also design three self-supervised learning strategies to facilitate the fusion of sequence and image representations, capturing a more generalizable joint representation. The results indicate that our approach outperforms seven other state-of-the-art models in three representative real-world clinical datasets. We further validate our approach by simulating two major types of real-world missingness through leave-sensors-out and leave-samples-out techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach is more robust and significantly surpasses other baselines in terms of classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |
| **[TimeDART: A Diffusion Autoregressive Transformer for Self-Supervised Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05711v3)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.05711v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has garnered increasing attention in time series analysis for benefiting various downstream tasks and reducing reliance on labeled data. Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose TimeDART, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/Melmaphother/TimeDART.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AdaPRL: Adaptive Pairwise Regression Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Universal Regression Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05809v3)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.05809v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current deep regression models usually learn in a point-wise way that treats each sample as an independent input, neglecting the relative ordering among different data. Consequently, the regression model could neglect the data's interrelationships, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance. Moreover, the existence of aleatoric uncertainty in the training data may drive the model to capture non-generalizable patterns, contributing to increased overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive pairwise learning framework for regression tasks (AdaPRL) which leverages the relative differences between data points and integrates with deep probabilistic models to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Additionally, we adapt AdaPRL for applications in multi-task learning and multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments with several real-world regression datasets including recommendation systems, age prediction, time series forecasting, natural language understanding, finance, and industry datasets show that AdaPRL is compatible with different backbone networks in various tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks without extra inference cost, highlighting its notable potential including enhancing prediction accuracy and ranking ability, increasing generalization capability, improving robustness to noisy data, improving resilience to reduced data, and enhancing interpretability. Experiments also show that AdaPRL can be seamlessly incorporated into recently proposed regression frameworks to gain performance improvement.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v1)** | 2025-02-09 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06037v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-augmented Large Language Models for Financial Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05878v1)** | 2025-02-09 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05878v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock movement prediction, a fundamental task in financial time-series forecasting, requires identifying and retrieving critical influencing factors from vast amounts of time-series data. However, existing text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods fall short in handling complex financial analysis. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for financial time-series forecasting, featuring three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B parameter large language model (StockLLM) as the backbone, a novel candidate selection method leveraging LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. This enables our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while minimizing noise in complex financial data. We also construct new datasets integrating financial indicators and historical stock prices to train FinSeer and ensure robust evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms bare StockLLM and random retrieval, highlighting its effectiveness, while FinSeer surpasses existing retrieval methods, achieving an 8\% higher accuracy on BIGDATA22 and retrieving more impactful sequences. This work underscores the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel framework for future research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16843v2)** | 2025-02-09 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.16843v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, when the time series data suffer from potential structural breaks or concept drifts, the forecasting performance might be significantly reduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) for optimal forecasting, which can be combined with existing time series forecasting models. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine the optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and then enhance the prediction performances of the base forecasting models. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive empirical analysis have been conducted on the M4 dataset and other real world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete time series dataset. Moreover, comparison results reveals that combining our approach with existing forecasting models can achieve better prediction accuracy, which also reflect the advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05722v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05722v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; 6 figures; submitted to 2025 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Flow-based Conformal Prediction for Multi-dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05709v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05709v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction for time series presents two key challenges: (1) leveraging sequential correlations in features and non-conformity scores and (2) handling multi-dimensional outcomes. We propose a novel conformal prediction method to address these two key challenges by integrating Transformer and Normalizing Flow. Specifically, the Transformer encodes the historical context of time series, and normalizing flow learns the transformation from the base distribution to the distribution of non-conformity scores conditioned on the encoded historical context. This enables the construction of prediction regions by transforming samples from the base distribution using the learned conditional flow. We ensure the marginal coverage by defining the prediction regions as sets in the transformed space that correspond to a predefined probability mass in the base distribution. The model is trained end-to-end by Flow Matching, avoiding the need for computationally intensive numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves smaller prediction regions compared to the baselines while satisfying the desired coverage through comprehensive experiments using simulated and real-world time series datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOKON: TOKenization-Optimized Normalization for time series analysis with a large language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05701v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05701v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have rapidly evolved towards general artificial intelligence, their versatility in analyzing time series data remains limited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel normalization technique that considers the inherent nature of tokenization. The proposed Tokenization-Optimized Normalization (TOKON) simplifies time series data by representing each element with a single token, effectively reducing the number of tokens by 2 to 3 times. Additionally, we introduce a novel prompt for time series forecasting, termed Time Series Forecasting with Care (TFSC), to further enhance forecasting performance. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKON improves root mean square error (RMSE) for multi-step forecasting by approximately 7% to 18%, depending on the dataset and prompting method. Furthermore, TFSC, when used in conjunction with TOKON, shows additional improvements in forecasting accuracy for certain datasets</p></details> |  |
| **[Context information can be more important than reasoning for time series forecasting with a large language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05699v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05699v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for time series tasks. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of LLMs for time series forecasting by considering various existing and proposed prompting techniques. Forecasting for both short and long time series was evaluated. Our findings indicate that no single prompting method is universally applicable. It was also observed that simply providing proper context information related to the time series, without additional reasoning prompts, can achieve performance comparable to the best-performing prompt for each case. From this observation, it is expected that providing proper context information can be more crucial than a prompt for specific reasoning in time series forecasting. Several weaknesses in prompting for time series forecasting were also identified. First, LLMs often fail to follow the procedures described by the prompt. Second, when reasoning steps involve simple algebraic calculations with several operands, LLMs often fail to calculate accurately. Third, LLMs sometimes misunderstand the semantics of prompts, resulting in incomplete responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning with Reservoir State Analysis for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05679v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05679v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a growing data privacy concern, federated learning has emerged as a promising framework to train machine learning models without sharing locally distributed data. In federated learning, local model training by multiple clients and model integration by a server are repeated only through model parameter sharing. Most existing federated learning methods assume training deep learning models, which are often computationally demanding. To deal with this issue, we propose federated learning methods with reservoir state analysis to seek computational efficiency and data privacy protection simultaneously. Specifically, our method relies on Mahalanobis Distance of Reservoir States (MD-RS) method targeting time series anomaly detection, which learns a distribution of reservoir states for normal inputs and detects anomalies based on a deviation from the learned distribution. Iterative updating of statistical parameters in the MD-RS enables incremental federated learning (IncFed MD-RS). We evaluate the performance of IncFed MD-RS using benchmark datasets for time series anomaly detection. The results show that IncFed MD-RS outperforms other federated learning methods with deep learning and reservoir computing models particularly when clients' data are relatively short and heterogeneous. We demonstrate that IncFed MD-RS is robust against reduced sample data compared to other methods. We also show that the computational cost of IncFed MD-RS can be reduced by subsampling from the reservoir states without performance degradation. The proposed method is beneficial especially in anomaly detection applications where computational efficiency, algorithm simplicity, and low communication cost are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 16 figures, submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Data Augmentation Policy Search for Long-Term Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00319v2)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.00319v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation serves as a popular regularization technique to combat overfitting challenges in neural networks. While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.

To resolve this, we propose FlowTS, an ODE-based model that leverages rectified flow with straight-line transport in probability space. By learning geodesic paths between distributions, FlowTS achieves computational efficiency through exact linear trajectory simulation, accelerating training and generation while improving performances. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy inspired by the exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing noise adaptation and precision. Notably, FlowTS enables seamless adaptation from unconditional to conditional generation without retraining, ensuring efficient real-world deployment. Also, to enhance generation authenticity, FlowTS integrates trend and seasonality decomposition, attention registers (for global context aggregation), and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (for position information). For unconditional setting, extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with context FID scores of 0.019 and 0.011 on Stock and ETTh datasets (prev. best: 0.067, 0.061). For conditional setting, we have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting (MSE 213, prev. best: 375) and MuJoCo imputation tasks (MSE 7e-5, prev. best 2.7e-4).

| **[Multi-Scale Conformal Prediction: A Theoretical Framework with Coverage Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05565v1)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05565v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-scale extension of conformal prediction, an approach that constructs prediction sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal statistical assumptions. Classic conformal prediction relies on a single notion of conformity, overlooking the multi-level structures that arise in applications such as image analysis, hierarchical data exploration, and multi-resolution time series modeling. In contrast, the proposed framework defines a distinct conformity function at each relevant scale or resolution, producing multiple conformal predictors whose prediction sets are then intersected to form the final multi-scale output. We establish theoretical results confirming that the multi-scale prediction set retains the marginal coverage guarantees of the original conformal framework and can, in fact, yield smaller or more precise sets in practice. By distributing the total miscoverage probability across scales in proportion to their informative power, the method further refines the set sizes. We also show that dependence between scales can lead to conservative coverage, ensuring that the actual coverage exceeds the nominal level. Numerical experiments in a synthetic classification setting demonstrate that multi-scale conformal prediction achieves or surpasses the nominal coverage level while generating smaller prediction sets compared to single-scale conformal methods.</p></details> |  |

Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have been long known for being problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. A TSF foundation model serving TSF tasks across different applications can reverse such an impression. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers a pioneering study in developing a TSF foundation model and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. In ViTime, a method synthesizing authentic time series periodic and trend patterns is developed to enrich sample pattern diversity. A deep architecture operating TSF in image metric space is designed to achieve significantly enhanced TSF generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's SOTA performance across multiple settings. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15%. With just 10% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks trained on complete datasets, with this performance gap widening further at 100\% fine-tuning. Additionally, ViTime exhibits exceptional robustness, handling missing data without imputation and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30% under various data perturbations.</p></details> |  |

This paper serves as a motivation and call for action, including opportunities for theoretical and applied research, as well as for building new dataset and benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12th ...</summary><p>12th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability</p></details> |

The datasets adhere to industry standards, covering communication protocols, actuators, control mechanisms, transducers, sensors, and cameras. Data collection utilized both integrated and external sensors throughout the laboratory, including sensors embedded within the actuators and externally installed devices. Additionally, high-performance cameras captured key aspects of the operation. In a prior experiment [1], a 30-hour continuous run was conducted, during which all anomalies were documented. Maintenance procedures were subsequently implemented to reduce potential errors and operational disruptions. The two datasets include: (1) a time-series analog dataset, and (2) a multi-modal time-series dataset containing synchronized system data and images. These datasets aim to support future research in advancing manufacturing processes by providing a platform for testing novel algorithms without the need to recreate physical manufacturing environments. Moreover, the datasets are open-source and designed to facilitate the training of artificial intelligence models, streamlining research by offering comprehensive, ready-to-use resources for various applications and projects.</p></details> |  |

Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting is crucial for effective market participation, where price dynamics can be significantly more challenging to predict. Probabilistic forecasting, through prediction intervals, efficiently quantifies the inherent uncertainties in electricity prices, supporting better decision-making for market participants. This study explores the enhancement of probabilistic price prediction using Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, specifically Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals and Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference. These methods provide precise and reliable prediction intervals, outperforming traditional models in validity metrics. We propose an ensemble approach that combines the efficiency of quantile regression models with the robust coverage properties of time series adapted CP techniques. This ensemble delivers both narrow prediction intervals and high coverage, leading to more reliable and accurate forecasts. We further evaluate the practical implications of CP techniques through a simulated trading algorithm applied to a battery storage system. The ensemble approach demonstrates improved financial returns in energy trading in both the Day-Ahead and Balancing Markets, highlighting its practical benefits for market participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v3)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.08435v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[The $α$-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593v1)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04593v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codebase will be made available upon publication.

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification for medical time series, e.g., Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, can help for early detection and diagnosis. Traditional methods towards medical time series classification rely on handcrafted feature extraction and statistical methods; with the recent advancement of artificial intelligence, the machine learning and deep learning methods have become more popular. However, existing methods often fail to fully model the complex spatial dynamics under different scales, which ignore the dynamic multi-resolution spatial and temporal joint inter-dependencies. Moreover, they are less likely to consider the special baseline wander problem as well as the multi-view characteristics of medical time series, which largely hinders their prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, MedGNN, for medical time series classification. Specifically, we first propose to construct multi-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale embeddings. Then, to address the baseline wander problem, we propose Difference Attention Networks to operate self-attention mechanisms on the finite difference for temporal modeling. Moreover, to learn the multi-view characteristics, we utilize the Frequency Convolution Networks to capture complementary information of medical time series from the frequency domain. In addition, we introduce the Multi-resolution Graph Transformer architecture to model the dynamic dependencies and fuse the information from different resolutions. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple medical real-world datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Existing solutions either rely on using certain statistics to specify the shift, or developing specific mechanisms for certain network architectures. However, the former would fail for the unknown shift beyond simple statistics, while the latter has limited compatibility on different forecasting models. To overcome these problems, we first propose a decoupled formulation for time series forecasting, with no reliance on fixed statistics and no restriction on forecasting architectures. This formulation regards the removing-shift procedure as a special transformation between a raw distribution and a desired target distribution and separates it from the forecasting. Such a formulation is further formalized into a bi-level optimization problem, to enable the joint learning of the transformation (outer loop) and forecasting (inner loop). Moreover, the special requirements of expressiveness and bi-direction for the transformation motivate us to propose instance normalization flow (IN-Flow), a novel invertible network for time series transformation. Different from the classic "normalizing flow" models, IN-Flow does not aim for normalizing input to the prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution) for generation, but creatively transforms time series distribution by stacking normalization layers and flow-based invertible networks, which is thus named "normalization" flow. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and define the reconstructability: The fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating (TDG) model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit: any algorithm can perform, on average, at best like the TDG model. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the TDG model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability of empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

A Gaussian kernel-based mean square error preserves local data structure, while K-means initializes shapelet candidates due to the non-convex optimization challenge. Unlike existing methods, our approach uses t-SNE to address crowding in low-dimensional space and applies L1-norm regularization to optimize shapelet length. Evaluations on the UCR dataset and an electrical component manipulation task, like switching on, demonstrate improved clustering accuracy over state-of-the-art feature-learning methods in robotics.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these limitations, available domain expert knowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used whenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an element from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the learning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely and irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes of a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to ambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given time series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a dynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable. Training a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally unidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification performance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability analysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with identical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability to generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical domain. This effect is especially pronounced when the number of training instances is limited. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for structural identifiability, a topic that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain a widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not designed to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches for time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually incorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a novel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism, similar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model learns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state updates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent. We provide a proof-of-concept study on synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.

Using multiple hand sensors, multivariate time series data are being captured. Given a number of possible actions on a number of objects, the goal is to classify the multivariate time series data, where the class shall be predicted as early as possible. Many machine-learning methods have been developed for such classification tasks, where different approaches produce favorable solutions on different data sets. We, therefore, employ an ensemble approach that includes and weights different approaches. To provide a trustworthy classification production, we present the XMTC tool that incorporates coordinated multiple-view visualizations to analyze the predictions. Temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots allow for the identification of the best trade-off between early prediction and prediction quality, the detection and analysis of challenging classification conditions, and the investigation of the prediction evolution in an overview and detail manner. We employ XMTC to real-world HCI data in multiple scenarios and show that good classification predictions can be achieved early on with our classifier as well as which conditions are easy to distinguish, which multivariate time series measurements impose challenges, and which features have most impact.</p></details> |  |

While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p></details> | 19 pages |

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

An alternative cause of randomness is chaos, which can be an important component of chaotic time series. One of the existing methods to deal with this type of data is the use of the evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFSs), which have been proven to be a powerful class of models for time series forecasting, due to their autonomy to handle the data and highly complex problems in real-world applications. However, due to its working structure, type-2 fuzzy sets can outperform type-1 fuzzy sets for highly uncertain scenarios. We then propose ePL-KRLS-FSM+, an enhanced class of evolving fuzzy modeling approach that combines participatory learning (PL), a kernel recursive least squares method (KRLS), type-2 fuzzy logic and data transformation into fuzzy sets (FSs). This improvement allows to create and measure type-2 fuzzy sets for better handling uncertainties in the data, generating a model that can predict chaotic data with increased accuracy. The model is evaluated using two complex datasets: the chaotic time series Mackey-Glass delay differential equation with different degrees of chaos, and the main stock index of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index - TAIEX. Model performance is compared to related state-of-the-art rule-based eFS models and classical approaches and is analyzed in terms of error metrics, runtime and the number of final rules. Forecasting results show that the proposed model is competitive and performs consistently compared with type-1 models, also outperforming other forecasting methods by showing the lowest error metrics and number of final rules.</p></details> |  |

Our previous work was the first to demonstrate that supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) could rapidly predict the tactics of swarming autonomous agents in military contexts, providing intelligence to inform counter-maneuvers. However, most autonomous interactions, especially military engagements, are fraught with uncertainty, raising questions about the practicality of using a pretrained classifier. This article addresses that challenge by leveraging expected operational variations to construct a richer dataset, resulting in a more robust NN with improved inference performance in scenarios characterized by significant uncertainties. Specifically, diverse datasets are created by simulating variations in defender numbers, defender motions, and measurement noise levels. Key findings indicate that robust NNs trained on an enriched dataset exhibit enhanced classification accuracy and offer operational flexibility, such as reducing resources required and offering adherence to trajectory constraints. Furthermore, we present a new framework for optimally deploying a trained NN by the defenders. The framework involves optimizing defender trajectories that elicit adversary responses that maximize the probability of correct NN tactic classification while also satisfying operational constraints imposed on the defenders.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, data are often distributed across multiple entities (e.g., companies, devices) that seek to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving data privacy and security. More importantly, due to the presence of diverse clients, the data may follow different distributions, resulting in data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses additional challenges for centralized approaches. In this study, we first introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from homogeneous time series data that are horizontally distributed across different parties. We then extend this approach to heterogeneous time series data by incorporating a proximal operator as a regularization term in a personalized federated learning framework. To this end, we propose \texttt{FDBNL} and \texttt{PFDBNL}, which leverage continuous optimization, ensuring that only model parameters are exchanged during the optimization process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in scenarios with many clients and limited individual sample sizes.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems.

The forecasting solution includes features such as weather conditions, calendar events, and time-of-day patterns. Results demonstrate the strong performance of ML-based meta-models and highlight the emerging potential of foundation models like Chronos and TimesFM, which deliver competitive performance with minimal feature engineering, leveraging only the pre-trained model (zero-shot inference).

However, limited data availability during emerging outbreaks and the complex interaction between environmental factors and disease dynamics present significant challenges for effective forecasting. In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings.

We prove that it is capable of automatically fitting autoregressive models with an arbitrary number of covariates, offering insights into its design and empirical success. For generalization, we establish bounds for pretraining when the data satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Experiments support our theoretical findings, highlighting the efficacy of transformers as time series foundation models.</p></details> | 34 Pages, 2 Figures |

While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty and ridge regularization, KANGCI effectively infers the Granger causality from time series. Additionally, we propose an algorithm based on time-reversed Granger causality that automatically selects causal relationships with better inference performance from the original or time-reversed time series or integrates the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, Gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, VAR, and real-world EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates this problem from the first principle and it makes four folds of contributions. First, a new empirical finding is revealed: time series with different time granularities (or corresponding frequency resolutions) exhibit distinct joint distributions in the frequency domain. This implies a crucial aspect of learning universal knowledge, one that has been overlooked by previous studies. Second, a novel Fourier knowledge attention mechanism is proposed to enable learning time granularity-aware representations from both the temporal and frequency domains. Third, an autoregressive blank infilling pre-training framework is incorporated to time series analysis for the first time, leading to a generative tasks agnostic pre-training strategy. To this end, we develop the General Time-series Model (GTM), a unified MTS foundation model that addresses the limitation of contemporary time series models, which often require token, pre-training, or model-level customizations for downstream tasks adaption. Fourth, extensive experiments show that GTM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all generative tasks, including long-term forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

This paper extends recent advancements in statistically significant CP detection, based on Selective Inference (SI), to the frequency domain. The proposed SI method quantifies the statistical significance of detected CPs in the frequency domain using $p$-values, ensuring that the detected changes reflect genuine structural shifts in the target system. We address two major technical challenges to achieve this. First, we extend the existing SI framework to the frequency domain by appropriately utilizing the properties of discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Second, we develop an SI method that provides valid $p$-values for CPs where changes occur across multiple frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reliably identifies genuine CPs with strong statistical guarantees, enabling more accurate root-cause analysis in the frequency domain of complex systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has been actively explored to tackle time series representation. However, a key challenge is that the data augmentation process in CL can distort seasonal patterns or temporal dependencies, inevitably leading to a loss of semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose Topological Contrastive Learning for time series (TopoCL). TopoCL mitigates such information loss by incorporating persistent homology, which captures the topological characteristics of data that remain invariant under transformations. In this paper, we treat the temporal and topological properties of time series data as distinct modalities. Specifically, we compute persistent homology to construct topological features of time series data, representing them in persistence diagrams. We then design a neural network to encode these persistent diagrams. Our approach jointly optimizes CL within the time modality and time-topology correspondence, promoting a comprehensive understanding of both temporal semantics and topological properties of time series. We conduct extensive experiments on four downstream tasks-classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and transfer learning. The results demonstrate that TopoCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TNNLS (under review)</p></details> |

Existing approaches have demonstrated the potential of leveraging mobility data to generate latent representations, providing valuable insights into the intrinsic characteristics of urban areas. However, incorporating the temporal dynamics and detailed semantics inherent in human mobility patterns remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel urban region representation learning model, Mobility Time Series Contrastive Learning for Urban Region Representations (MobiCLR), designed to capture semantically meaningful embeddings from inflow and outflow mobility patterns. MobiCLR uses contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative power of its representations, applying an instance-wise contrastive loss to capture distinct flow-specific characteristics. Additionally, we develop a regularizer to align output features with these flow-specific representations, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of mobility dynamics. To validate our model, we conduct extensive experiments in Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C. to predict income, educational attainment, and social vulnerability.

Our approach employs a neural emission model to generate each data point in the time series through a non-linear transformation of a latent state vector. The evolution of these latent states is implicitly defined by a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE), with the initial state drawn from an informative prior distribution parameterized by an Energy-based model (EBM). This framework is extended to disentangle dynamic states from underlying static factors of variation, represented as time-invariant variables in the latent space. We train the model using maximum likelihood estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on oscillating systems, videos and real-world state sequences (MuJoCo) demonstrate that our model with the learnable energy-based prior outperforms existing counterparts, and can generalize to new dynamic parameterization, enabling long-horizon predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems, which typically operate in a Question Answering (QA) manner, are significantly limited in terms of the duration and complexity of sensor data they can handle. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for long-term sensor monitoring with multimodal and high-dimensional data including time series. SensorChat effectively answers both qualitative (requiring high-level reasoning) and quantitative (requiring accurate responses derived from sensor data) questions in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline that includes question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for intuitive human interactions and to guide the sensor data query process. Unlike existing multimodal LLMs, SensorChat incorporates an explicit query stage to precisely extract factual information from long-duration sensor data. We implement SensorChat and demonstrate its capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 26% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in handling qualitative and open-ended questions.</p></details> | Under review |

However, despite advances in CD methods, their practical application in real-world contexts remains limited due to the diverse input data and the applicational context. For example, the collected RSIs can be time-series observations, and more informative results are required to indicate the time of change or the specific change category. Moreover, training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) requires a massive amount of training samples, whereas in many cases these samples are difficult to collect. To address these challenges, various specific CD methods have been developed considering different application scenarios and training resources. Additionally, recent advancements in image generation, self-supervision, and visual foundation models (VFMs) have opened up new approaches to address the 'data-hungry' issue of DL-based CD. The development of these methods in broader application scenarios requires further investigation and discussion. Therefore, this article summarizes the literature methods for different CD tasks and the available strategies and techniques to train and deploy DL-based CD methods in sample-limited scenarios.

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Traditional machine learning algorithms rely on well-defined input and output variables; however, there are scenarios where the separation between the input and output variables and the underlying, associated input and output layers of the model are unknown. Feature Selection (FS) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have emerged as promising solutions in such scenarios. This paper proposes MICS-EFS, a Model Input-Output Configuration Search with Embedded Feature Selection. The methodology explores internal dependencies in the complete input parameter space for classification tasks involving both 1D sensor time-series and 2D image data. MICS-EFS employs a modified encoder-decoder model and the Sequential Forward Search (SFS) algorithm, combining input-output configuration search with embedded feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MICS-EFS compared to other FS algorithms. Across all tested datasets, MICS-EFS delivered an average accuracy improvement of 1.5% over baseline models, with the accuracy gains ranging from 0.5% to 5.9%. Moreover, the algorithm reduced feature dimensionality to just 2-5% of the original data, significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve better zero-shot forecast performance than existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting that visual models may offer a "free lunch" for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

The moderation level varies across platforms; even over time, it can evolve in a platform. For example, Parler, a fringe social media platform popular among conservative users, was known to have the least restrictive moderation policies, claiming to have open discussion spaces for their users. However, after linking the 2021 US Capitol Riots and the activity of some groups on Parler, such as QAnon and Proud Boys, on January 12, 2021, Parler was removed from the Apple and Google App Store and suspended from Amazon Cloud hosting service. Parler would have to modify their moderation policies to return to these online stores. After a month of downtime, Parler was back online with a new set of user guidelines, which reflected stricter content moderation, especially regarding the \emph{hate speech} policy. In this paper, we studied the moderation changes performed by Parler and their effect on the toxicity of its content. We collected a large longitudinal Parler dataset with 17M parleys from 432K active users from February 2021 to January 2022, after its return to the Internet and App Store. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effectiveness of content moderation techniques using data-driven approaches and also the first Parler dataset after its brief hiatus. Our quasi-experimental time series analysis indicates that after the change in Parler's moderation, the severe forms of toxicity (above a threshold of 0.5) immediately decreased and sustained. In contrast, the trend did not change for less severe threats and insults (a threshold between 0.5 - 0.7). Finally, we found an increase in the factuality of the news sites being shared, as well as a decrease in the number of conspiracy or pseudoscience sources being shared.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at The Web Conference 2025 (WWW 2025), please cite accordingly</p></details> |

Unlike regular time series, which assume values at evenly spaced time points, asynchronous time series consist of timestamped events occurring at irregular intervals, each described in natural language. Our approach effectively utilizes the rich natural language of event descriptions, allowing LLMs to benefit from their broad world knowledge for reasoning across different domains and tasks. This allows us to extend the scope of asynchronous time series analysis beyond forecasting to include tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation. We further introduce Stochastic Soft Prompting, a novel prompt-tuning mechanism that significantly improves model performance, outperforming existing fine-tuning methods such as QLoRA. Through extensive experiments on real world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across different tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |

A Fresh Perspective on Deep Learning for Medical Time-Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08442v2)** | 2025-02-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.08442v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series imputation, examining how architectural and framework biases combine to influence model performance. Our investigation reveals varying capabilities of deep imputers in capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies within EHRs, and that model effectiveness depends on how its combined biases align with medical time-series characteristics. Our experimental evaluation challenges common assumptions about model complexity, demonstrating that larger models do not necessarily improve performance. Rather, carefully designed architectures can better capture the complex patterns inherent in clinical data. The study highlights the need for imputation approaches that prioritise clinically meaningful data reconstruction over statistical accuracy. Our experiments show imputation performance variations of up to 20\% based on preprocessing and implementation choices, emphasising the need for standardised benchmarking methodologies. Finally, we identify critical gaps between current deep imputation methods and medical requirements, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical insights to achieve more reliable imputation approaches for healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

While current approaches predominantly rely on random masking for model evaluation, this practice fails to capture the structured nature of missing patterns in clinical data. Using the PhysioNet Challenge 2012 dataset, we analyse how different masking implementations affect both imputation accuracy and downstream clinical predictions across eleven imputation methods. Our results demonstrate that masking choices significantly influence model performance, while recurrent architectures show more consistent performance across strategies. Analysis of downstream mortality prediction reveals that imputation accuracy doesn't necessarily translate to optimal clinical prediction capabilities. Our findings emphasise the need for clinically-informed masking strategies that better reflect real-world missing patterns in healthcare data, suggesting current evaluation frameworks may need reconsideration for reliable clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs? We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency. Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract shortened for arXiv</p></details> |

We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME) benchmark, ReasonFlux-32B solves an average of 56.7% of problems, surpassing o1-preview and DeepSeek-V3 by 27% and 45%, respectively.

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of a graph querying language, limiting the ability for users -- even experts -- to acquire valuable insights from KGs. LinkQ simplifies this process by implementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's question, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps users iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting both targeted and exploratory analysis. Further, LinkQ guards against the LLM hallucinating outputs by ensuring users' questions are only ever answered from ground truth KG data. We demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ through a qualitative study with five KG practitioners. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted exploratory data analysis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source code: https://github.com/mit-ll/linkq</p></details> |

Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after hundreds of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that progress on tamper-resistance is possible, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://www.tamper-resistant-safeguards.com</p></details> |

Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

We explore two such changes: pairing questions and adding more answer options, on three benchmarks: WMDP-bio, GPQA, and MMLU variants. We find that for more capable models, these predictably reduce performance, essentially heightening the performance ceiling of a benchmark and unsaturating it again. We suggest this approach can resurrect old benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06703v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06703v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data.

Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains challenging. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp combines coverage analysis, code context, and feedback in prompts that iteratively guide the LLM to generate tests that improve line and branch coverage. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We also demonstrate that CoverUp's performance stems not only from the LLM used but from the combined effectiveness of its components.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Close-ended measurements evaluate the factuality of responses but lack expressiveness. Open-ended capture the model's capacity to produce discourse responses but are harder to assess for correctness. These two approaches are commonly used, either independently or together, though their relationship remains poorly understood. This work is focused on the healthcare domain, where both factuality and discourse matter greatly. It introduces a comprehensive, multi-axis suite for healthcare LLM evaluation, exploring correlations between open and close benchmarks and metrics. Findings include blind spots and overlaps in current methodologies. As an updated sanity check, we release a new medical benchmark--CareQA--, with both open and closed variants. Finally, we propose a novel metric for open-ended evaluations --Relaxed Perplexity-- to mitigate the identified limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights to the research of LLM data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report; 31 pages</p></details> |

While recent research has focused on optimizing prompt content, the role of prompt formatting, a critical but often overlooked dimension, has received limited systematic investigation. In this paper, we introduce Content-Format Integrated Prompt Optimization (CFPO), an innovative methodology that jointly optimizes both prompt content and formatting through an iterative refinement process. CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods. This highlights the importance of integrated content-format optimization and offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to enhancing LLM performance.

However, both approaches are computationally expensive and slow, often requiring significant resources to generate a single successful attack. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of these methods arises from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem itself. To address this gap, we approach the jailbreak problem as an alignment problem, leading us to propose LIAR (Leveraging Inference time Alignment to jailbReak), a fast and efficient best-of-N approach tailored for jailbreak attacks. LIAR offers several key advantages: it eliminates the need for additional training, operates in a fully black-box setting, significantly reduces computational overhead, and produces more human-readable adversarial prompts while maintaining competitive attack success rates. Our results demonstrate that a best-of-N approach is a simple yet highly effective strategy for evaluating the robustness of aligned LLMs, achieving attack success rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a 10x improvement in perplexity and a significant speedup in Time-to-Attack, reducing execution time from tens of hours to seconds. Additionally, We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed LIAR. Our work highlights the potential of efficient, alignment-based jailbreak strategies for assessing and stress-testing AI safety measures.</p></details> |  |

However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning. Our framework enables leveraging legal knowledge to enhance generation diversity and introduces a refinement and verification process to ensure the quality of generated data. Moreover, we expand the generated dataset to further enhance the LLM reasoning capabilities. Using KgDG, we create a synthetic legal reasoning dataset containing 50K high-quality examples. Our trained model LawGPT outperforms existing legal-specific LLMs and achieves performance comparable to proprietary LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of KgDG and LawGPT.

Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP synthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the foundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art models may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data algorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the Private Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was designed for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our extension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance measure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of algorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries to the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not always improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established baselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the underlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more effective for this application.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures.

Naija is a Nigerian Pidgin spoken by approximately 120M speakers and it is a mixed language (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are some online platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), publishing in written Naija as well. West African Pidgin English (WAPE) is also spoken in Nigeria and it is used by BBC to broadcast news on the internet to a wider audience not only in Nigeria but also in other West African countries (e.g., Cameroon and Ghana). Through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments, our paper shows that these two pidgin varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is underrepresented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples. In addition to the statistical analyses, we also provide historical information on both pidgins as well as insights from the interviews conducted with volunteer Wikipedia contributors in Naija.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (findings)</p></details> |

In this study, we first characterize LLM-guided conversation into three fundamental components: (i) Goal Navigation; (ii) Context Management; (iii) Empathetic Engagement, and propose GuideLLM as an installation. We then implement an interviewing environment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation. Specifically, various topics are involved in this environment for comprehensive interviewing evaluation, resulting in around 1.4k turns of utterances, 184k tokens, and over 200 events mentioned during the interviewing for each chatbot evaluation. We compare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and autobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user proxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM behaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human participants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines. We then collect human feedback, preferences, and ratings regarding the qualities of conversation and autobiography.

This integration enables privacy-preserving data sharing by verifying user traits without disclosing sensitive information.

In this paper, we investigate the questions of assessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide high-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation faces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which prevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true label; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the performance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring the annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the annotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the behaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators. The model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize annotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the joint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a technical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the principal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent. We show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the continuous action space) is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log n})$ for the binary contracts and $\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number of samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known result of $\exp(-\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is discrete. Throughout the paper, we use real preference annotation data to accompany our discussions.</p></details> |  |

However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |

Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), an uncertainty-aware approach, enables uncertainty estimation in a single forward pass, making it a promising method for calibrating fine-tuned LLMs. However, despite its computational efficiency, EDL is prone to overfitting, as its training objective can result in overly concentrated probability distributions. To mitigate this, we propose regularizing EDL by incorporating an information bottleneck (IB). Our approach IB-EDL suppresses spurious information in the evidence generated by the model and encourages truly predictive information to influence both the predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments across various fine-tuned LLMs and tasks demonstrate that IB-EDL outperforms both existing EDL and non-EDL approaches. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, IB-EDL facilitates their broader adoption in domains requiring high levels of confidence calibration.

Detecting such manipulations traditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework that automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM models. Our approach begins with domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes precise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic papers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or auditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to generate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a third LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart contracts. We validate the framework effectiveness through experiments on 60 known vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021 to 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini) identified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs 0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining comparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy and security for developers.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, SeaBench is crafted around multi-turn, open-ended tasks that reflect daily interactions within SEA communities.

Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structural attributes}$ (response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavioral attributes}$ (answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggests potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.</p></details> |  |

However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.</p></details> | 25 pages |

This study examines how different timings of LLM usage - either at the beginning or after independent ideation - affect people's perceptions and ideation outcomes in a writing task. In a controlled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using LLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and lowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes in autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation. We propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while considering users' self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the ideation outcomes.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns.

This benchmark assesses LLMs from various aspects including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment script quality, aiming to explore their potential in conducting computer science research autonomously. We also introduce a novel framework, CSR-Agents, that utilizes multiple LLM agents to automate the deployment of GitHub code repositories of computer science research projects. Specifically, by checking instructions from markdown files and interpreting repository structures, the model generates and iteratively improves bash commands that set up the experimental environments and deploy the code to conduct research tasks.

However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models in both a zero-shot and few-shot setting. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform zero-shot LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. Moreover, few-shot in-context learning leads to only a marginal increase in the performance of LLMs, still lacking compared to SLMs. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques. Finally, we outline directions for future work on language model based content moderation.

To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly.

We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Conference on Applied Machine Learning in Information Security, 2024</p></details> |

This research systematically compares the performance of available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique linguistic characteristics.

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Despite the growing application of LLMs in AI-driven psychological counseling, existing datasets predominantly focus on Western and East Asian contexts, overlooking cultural and linguistic nuances essential for effective Persian-language therapy. To address this gap, HamRaz combines script-based dialogues with adaptive LLM role-playing, ensuring coherent and dynamic therapy interactions. We also introduce HamRazEval, a dual evaluation framework that measures conversational quality and therapeutic effectiveness using General Dialogue Metrics and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI). Experimental results show HamRaz outperforms conventional Script Mode and Two-Agent Mode, producing more empathetic, context-aware, and realistic therapy sessions. By releasing HamRaz, we contribute a culturally adapted, LLM-driven resource to advance AI-powered psychotherapy research in diverse communities.</p></details> |  |

However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce MetaChain-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, MetaChain comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, MetaChain also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate MetaChain's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, MetaChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/HKUDS/MetaChain</p></details> |

GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. GenEOL also achieves notable gains in clustering, reranking, and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.

We propose a simple and low complexity strategy to generate candidates and construct the dynamic tree structure. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method improves the decoding efficiency of multiple head decoding for LLMs while maintaining the generation quality. This result demonstrates the potential for improvement of multiple head decoding in candidate generation.</p></details> |  |

A common solution to this memory challenge is offloading compute and data from the GPU to the CPU. However, this approach is hampered by the limited bandwidth of commodity hardware, which constrains communication between the CPU and GPU, and by slower matrix multiplications on the CPU. In this paper, we present an offloading framework, LSP-Offload, that enables near-native speed LLM fine-tuning on commodity hardware through learned sparse projectors. Our data-driven approach involves learning efficient sparse compressors that minimize communication with minimal precision loss. Additionally, we introduce a novel layer-wise communication schedule to maximize parallelism between communication and computation. As a result, our framework can fine-tune a 1.3 billion parameter model on a 4GB laptop GPU and a 6.7 billion parameter model on a 24GB NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading frameworks, our approach reduces end-to-end fine-tuning time by 33.1%-62.5% when converging to the same accuracy.

However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on several new tasks without updating the model's parameters i.e. using zero or a few labeled examples, but the capabilities of LLMs are yet unexplored for feature-specific sentiment analysis. The goal of our study is to explore the capabilities of LLMs to perform feature-specific sentiment analysis of user reviews. This study compares the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and different variants of Llama-2 chat, against previous approaches for extracting app features and associated sentiments in zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot scenarios. The results indicate that GPT-4 outperforms the rule-based SAFE by 17% in f1-score for extracting app features in the zero-shot scenario, with 5-shot further improving it by 6%. However, the fine-tuned RE-BERT exceeds GPT-4 by 6% in f1-score. For predicting positive and neutral sentiments, GPT-4 achieves f1-scores of 76% and 45% in the zero-shot setting, which improve by 7% and 23% in the 5-shot setting, respectively.

Researchers have examined LLMs' decision-making through the lens of Game Theory. However, existing evaluation mainly focus on two-player scenarios where an LLM competes against another. Additionally, previous benchmarks suffer from test set leakage due to their static design. We introduce GAMA($\gamma$)-Bench, a new framework for evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. It includes eight classical game theory scenarios and a dynamic scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs' performance. $\gamma$-Bench allows flexible game settings and adapts the scoring system to different game parameters, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robustness, generalizability, and strategies for improvement. Our results indicate that GPT-3.5 demonstrates strong robustness but limited generalizability, which can be enhanced using methods like Chain-of-Thought.

To address this issue, we explore the dataset condensation for textual CBR in this paper. The goal of dataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon which models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large datasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification tasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them to CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset condensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable abilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation, we leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during condensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we devise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At content-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new informative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis module, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user interests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate interactions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this method is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized dataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three authentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. Particularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance while reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of TheWebConf'25 accepted paper</p></details> |

The existing deployment model, which dedicates machines to each workload, simplifies SLO management but often leads to poor resource utilization. This paper introduces HyGen, an interference-aware LLM serving system that enables efficient co-location of online and offline workloads while preserving latency requirements. HyGen incorporates two key innovations: (1) performance control mechanisms, including a latency predictor to estimate batch execution time and an SLO-aware profiler to quantify latency interference, and (2) SLO-aware offline scheduling policies that maximize serving throughput and prevent starvation, without compromising online serving latency. Our evaluation on production workloads shows that HyGen achieves up to 3.87x overall throughput and 5.84x offline throughput gains over online and hybrid serving baselines, respectively, while strictly satisfying latency SLOs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations.

Existing low-rank optimization methods typically project gradients onto a low-rank subspace, reducing the memory cost of storing optimizer states. A key challenge in these methods is identifying suitable subspaces to ensure an effective optimization trajectory. Most existing approaches select the dominant subspace to preserve gradient information, as this intuitively provides the best approximation. However, we find that in practice, the dominant subspace stops changing during pretraining, thereby constraining weight updates to similar subspaces. In this paper, we propose importance sampling subspace selection (I3S) for low-rank optimization, which theoretically offers a comparable convergence rate to the dominant subspace approach. Empirically, we demonstrate that I3S significantly outperforms previous methods in LLM pretraining tasks.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic empirical evaluation of three different LLM variants across multiple parameter configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing methodology in assessing both functional correctness and extra-functional properties. Our framework implements 17 distinct metrics that encompass syntactic analysis, semantic evaluation, and behavioral evaluation through LLM judges. The study reveals significant information about how different architectural choices and parameter configurations affect system performance, particularly highlighting the impact of temperature and top-p parameters on response quality. The tests were carried out on a tourism recommendation system for the V\"armland region, utilizing standard and RAG-enhanced configurations. The results indicate that the newer LLM versions show modest improvements in performance metrics, though the differences are more pronounced in response length and complexity rather than in semantic quality. The research contributes practical insights for implementing robust testing practices in LLM-RAG systems, providing valuable guidance to organizations deploying these architectures in production environments.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We reveal significant biases in how models generate and select educational content tailored to different demographic groups, including race, ethnicity, sex, gender, disability status, income, and national origin. We introduce and apply two bias score metrics--Mean Absolute Bias (MAB) and Maximum Difference Bias (MDB)--to analyze 9 open and closed state-of-the-art LLMs. Our experiments, which utilize over 17,000 educational explanations across multiple difficulty levels and topics, uncover that models potentially harm student learning by both perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reversing them. We find that bias is similar for all frontier models, with the highest MAB along income levels while MDB is highest relative to both income and disability status.

In this work, we explore LLM evaluation challenges for low-resource language understanding and introduce \proverbeval, LLM evaluation benchmark for low-resource languages, focusing on low-resource language understanding in culture-specific scenarios. We benchmark various LLMs and explore factors that create variability in the benchmarking process. We observed performance variances of up to 50\%, depending on the order in which answer choices were presented in multiple-choice tasks. Native language proverb descriptions significantly improve tasks such as proverb generation, contributing to improved outcomes. Additionally, monolingual evaluations consistently outperformed their cross-lingual counterparts in generation tasks. We argue that special attention must be given to the order of choices, the choice of prompt language, task variability, and generation tasks when creating LLM evaluation benchmarks.

These defenses act as scanners that seek to detect harmful activations before they lead to undesirable actions. This prompts the question: Can models execute harmful behavior via inconspicuous latent states? Here, we study such obfuscated activations. We show that state-of-the-art latent-space defenses -- including sparse autoencoders, representation probing, and latent OOD detection -- are all vulnerable to obfuscated activations. For example, against probes trained to classify harmfulness, our attacks can often reduce recall from 100% to 0% while retaining a 90% jailbreaking rate. However, obfuscation has limits: we find that on a complex task (writing SQL code), obfuscation reduces model performance. Together, our results demonstrate that neural activations are highly malleable: we can reshape activation patterns in a variety of ways, often while preserving a network's behavior.

However, it remains difficult to evaluate LLM behavior on user-defined tasks and craft effective pipelines to do so. Many users struggle with where to start, often referred to as the "blank page problem." ChainBuddy, an AI workflow generation assistant built into the ChainForge platform, aims to tackle this issue. From a single prompt or chat, ChainBuddy generates a starter evaluative LLM pipeline in ChainForge aligned to the user's requirements. ChainBuddy offers a straightforward and user-friendly way to plan and evaluate LLM behavior and make the process less daunting and more accessible across a wide range of possible tasks and use cases. We report a within-subjects user study comparing ChainBuddy to the baseline interface. We find that when using AI assistance, participants reported a less demanding workload, felt more confident, and produced higher quality pipelines evaluating LLM behavior. However, we also uncover a mismatch between subjective and objective ratings of performance: participants rated their successfulness similarly across conditions, while independent experts rated participant workflows significantly higher with AI assistance. Drawing connections to the Dunning-Kruger effect, we draw design implications for the future of workflow generation assistants to mitigate the risk of over-reliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, pre-print</p></details> |

However most works don't target the largest component of allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored for the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used in the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous methods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained parameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding additional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either pretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing compute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher for larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

This process is time-consuming and can be compromised by human factors like fatigue, inconsistency, missing tiny details, etc. Given the latest major developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is very compelling to rigorously study whether LLMs can help metareviewers perform this important task better. In this paper, we perform a case study with three popular LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM2, to assist meta-reviewers in better comprehending multiple experts perspectives by generating a controlled multi-perspective summary (MPS) of their opinions. To achieve this, we prompt three LLMs with different types/levels of prompts based on the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy. Finally, we perform a detailed qualitative study of the MPSs generated by the LLMs and report our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025, 41 pages</p></details> |

One challenging reasoning domain with interesting nuances is legal reasoning, which requires careful application of rules, and precedents while balancing deductive and analogical reasoning, and conflicts between rules. Although there have been a few works on using LLMs for legal reasoning, their focus has been on overall accuracy. In this paper, we dig deeper to do a step-by-step analysis and figure out where they commit errors. We use the college-level Multiple Choice Question-Answering (MCQA) task from the \textit{Civil Procedure} dataset and propose a new error taxonomy derived from initial manual analysis of reasoning chains with respect to several LLMs, including two objective measures: soundness and correctness scores. We then develop an LLM-based automated evaluation framework to identify reasoning errors and evaluate the performance of LLMs. The computation of soundness and correctness on the dataset using the auto-evaluator framework reveals several interesting insights. Furthermore, we show that incorporating the error taxonomy as feedback in popular prompting techniques marginally increases LLM performance. Our work will also serve as an evaluation framework that can be used in detailed error analysis of reasoning chains for logic-intensive complex tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please cite as: Can Unconfident LLM Annotations Be Used for Confident Conclusions?

Multi-stage pretraining is a promising approach, but existing methods often lack quantitative criteria for data partitioning and instead rely on intuitive heuristics. In this paper, we propose the novel Four-quadRAnt Multi-stage prEtraining Strategy (FRAMES), guided by the established principle of organizing the pretraining process into four stages to achieve significant loss reductions four times. This principle is grounded in two key findings: first, training on high Perplexity (PPL) data followed by low PPL data, and second, training on low PPL difference (PD) data followed by high PD data, both causing the loss to drop significantly twice and performance enhancements. By partitioning data into four quadrants and strategically organizing them, FRAMES achieves a remarkable 16.8% average improvement over random sampling across MMLU and CMMLU, effectively boosting LLM performance.</p></details> |  |

This highlights the need for (1) a careful approach when measuring model confidences and calibration errors and (2) future research into algorithms that can help LLMs to achieve both instruction-following and calibration without sacrificing either.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the BlackboxNLP Workshop at EMNLP 2024 (Poster)</p></details> |

Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as evaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI tutors' development.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Existing works generate imprecise motions that fail to accurately capture relationships specified in text due to: (1) lack of effective text parsing for detailed semantic cues regarding body parts, (2) not fully modeling linguistic structures between words to comprehend text comprehensively. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel fine-grained framework Fg-T2M++ that consists of: (1) an LLMs semantic parsing module to extract body part descriptions and semantics from text, (2) a hyperbolic text representation module to encode relational information between text units by embedding the syntactic dependency graph into hyperbolic space, and (3) a multi-modal fusion module to hierarchically fuse text and motion features. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that Fg-T2M++ outperforms SOTA methods, validating its ability to accurately generate motions adhering to comprehensive text semantics.</p></details> |  |

As the false belief in a model can harm the usability of such systems, LLMs should not have cognitive biases that humans have. Psychologists especially focus on the False Consensus Effect (FCE), a cognitive bias where individuals overestimate the extent to which others share their beliefs or behaviors, because FCE can distract smooth communication by posing false beliefs. However, previous studies have less examined FCE in LLMs thoroughly, which needs more consideration of confounding biases, general situations, and prompt changes. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct two studies to examine the FCE phenomenon in LLMs. In Study 1, we investigate whether LLMs have FCE. In Study 2, we explore how various prompting styles affect the demonstration of FCE. As a result of these studies, we identified that popular LLMs have FCE. Also, the result specifies the conditions when FCE becomes more or less prevalent compared to normal usage.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

To address these limitations, we propose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates an Teacher LLM to guide an attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics, historical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts, the LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought reasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL agent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness across diverse driving conditions. Our experimental results, evaluated across multiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline methods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates, average returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the importance of each model component, especially the synergy between the attention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance. These findings suggest that TeLL-Drive significantly enhances both the adaptability and safety of autonomous driving systems, while offering a more efficient and scalable approach for policy learning.

Specifically, LLMs can play three critical roles: (1) as data enhancers, improving the creation of learning materials or serving as student simulations; (2) as task predictors, serving as learner assessment or optimizing learning pathway; and (3) as agents, enabling personalized and inclusive education. We encourage interdisciplinary research to explore these roles, fostering innovation while addressing challenges and risks, ultimately advancing FLE through the thoughtful integration of LLMs.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks like centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) struggle with scalability and flexibility. They require centralized long-term planning, which is difficult without custom reward functions, and face challenges in processing multi-modal data. CTDE approaches also assume fixed cooperation strategies, making them impractical in dynamic environments where agents need to adapt and plan independently. To address decentralized multi-agent cooperation, we propose Decentralized Adaptive Knowledge Graph Memory and Structured Communication System (DAMCS) in a novel Multi-agent Crafter environment. Our generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are more scalable than traditional MARL agents by leveraging external knowledge and language for long-term planning and reasoning. Instead of fully sharing information from all past experiences, DAMCS introduces a multi-modal memory system organized as a hierarchical knowledge graph and a structured communication protocol to optimize agent cooperation. This allows agents to reason from past interactions and share relevant information efficiently. Experiments on novel multi-agent open-world tasks show that DAMCS outperforms both MARL and LLM baselines in task efficiency and collaboration. Compared to single-agent scenarios, the two-agent scenario achieves the same goal with 63% fewer steps, and the six-agent scenario with 74% fewer steps, highlighting the importance of adaptive memory and structured communication in achieving long-term goals. We publicly release our project at: https://happyeureka.github.io/damcs.</p></details> |  |

Rather than explicitly rejecting harmful instructions, HumorReject responds with contextually appropriate humor that naturally defuses potentially dangerous requests. Our approach effectively addresses common "over-defense" issues while demonstrating superior robustness against various attack vectors. Our findings suggest that improvements in training data design can be as important as the alignment algorithm itself in achieving effective LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

However, their inherent vulnerabilities and susceptibility to bugs have led to significant financial losses, underscoring the challenges in securing smart contracts. While traditional auditing methods are crucial, they often fall short in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of smart contracts. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions for enhancing software auditing by automatically identifying security vulnerabilities. Despite their potential, the practical application of these models is hindered by substantial computational demands. This paper investigates the feasibility of using smaller, fine-tuned models to achieve comparable or even superior results in smart contract auditing. We introduce the FTSmartAudit framework, which is designed to develop cost-effective, specialized models for smart contract auditing through the fine-tuning of LLMs. Our contributions include: (1) a single-task learning framework that streamlines data preparation, training, evaluation, and continuous learning; (2) a robust dataset generation method utilizing domain-special knowledge distillation to produce high-quality datasets from advanced models like GPT-4o; (3) an adaptive learning strategy to maintain model accuracy and robustness; (4) the proven effectiveness of fine-tuned models in detecting specific vulnerabilities and complex logical errors; and (5) a framework that can be extended to other domains requiring LLM solutions.

Recently, benefiting from the vast inherent knowledge, Large Language Model (LLM) approach demonstrates strong performance and long-tail generalization ability compared with previous neural-based specialized relevance learning methods. Though promising, current LLM-based methods encounter the following inadequacies in practice: First, the massive parameters and computational demands make it difficult to be deployed online. Second, distilling LLM models to online models is a feasible direction, but the LLM relevance modeling is a black box, and its rich intrinsic knowledge is difficult to extract and apply online. To improve the interpretability of LLM and boost the performance of online relevance models via LLM, we propose an Explainable LLM-driven Multi-dimensional Distillation framework for e-commerce relevance learning, which comprises two core components: (1) An Explainable LLM for relevance modeling (ELLM-rele), which decomposes the relevance learning into intermediate steps and models relevance learning as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, thereby enhancing both interpretability and performance of LLM. (2) A Multi-dimensional Knowledge Distillation (MKD) architecture that transfers the knowledge of ELLM-rele to current deployable interaction-based and representation-based student models from both the relevance score distribution and CoT reasoning aspects. Through distilling the probabilistic and CoT reasoning knowledge, MKD improves both the semantic interaction and long-tail generalization abilities of student models.

In response, we introduce XPUTimer, a real-time diagnostic framework designed for distributed LLM training at scale. XPUTimer first integrates a lightweight tracing daemon to monitor key code segments with minimal overhead. Additionally, it features a diagnostic engine that employs novel intra-kernel tracing and holistic aggregated metrics to efficiently identify and resolve anomalies. Deployment of XPUTimer across 6,000 GPUs over eight months demonstrated significant improvements across the training stack, validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Binarization, as an efficient compression method that reduces model weights to just 1 bit, significantly lowers both computational and memory requirements. Despite this, the binarized LLM still contains redundancy, which can be further compressed. Semi-structured pruning provides a promising approach to achieve this, which offers a better trade-off between model performance and hardware efficiency. However, simply combining binarization with semi-structured pruning can lead to a significant performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P) method for LLM compression. We first propose a Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO). Our optimization strategy significantly reduces the total error caused by pruning and binarization, even below that of the no-pruning scenario. Furthermore, we design a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) method to select pruning elements more effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBS$^2$P achieves superior accuracy across various LLM families and evaluation metrics, noticeably outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) binary PTQ methods. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PBS2P.</p></details> |  |

In this situation, utilizing self-generated synthetic data has become crucial for fine-tuning LLMs without extensive human annotation. However, current methods often fail to ensure consistent improvements across iterations, with performance stagnating after only minimal updates. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO). DNPO employs a dynamic sample labeling mechanism to construct preference pairs for training and introduces controlled, trainable noise into the preference optimization process. Our approach effectively prevents stagnation and enables continuous improvement. In experiments with Zephyr-7B, DNPO consistently outperforms existing methods, showing an average performance boost of 2.6% across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DNPO shows a significant improvement in model-generated data quality, with a 29.4% win-loss rate gap compared to the baseline in GPT-4 evaluations. This highlights its effectiveness in enhancing model performance through iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, a popular class of methods utilize the LLM's self-consistencies in its beliefs in a set of logically related augmented statements generated by the LLM, which does not require external knowledge databases and can work with both white-box and black-box LLMs. However, in many existing approaches, the augmented statements tend to be very monotone and unstructured, which makes it difficult to integrate meaningful information from the LLM beliefs in these statements. Also, many methods work with the binarized version of the LLM's belief, instead of the continuous version, which significantly loses information. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose Belief Tree Propagation (BTProp), a probabilistic framework for LLM hallucination detection. BTProp introduces a belief tree of logically related statements by recursively decomposing a parent statement into child statements with three decomposition strategies, and builds a hidden Markov tree model to integrate the LLM's belief scores in these statements in a principled way. Experiment results show that our method improves baselines by 3%-9% (evaluated by AUROC and AUC-PR) on multiple hallucination detection benchmarks.

Recent PTQ studies have primarily focused on quantizing only weights to sub-8-bits while maintaining activations at 8-bits or higher. Accurate sub-8-bit quantization for both weights and activations without relying on quantization-aware training remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel quantization method called block clustered quantization (BCQ) wherein each operand tensor is decomposed into blocks (a block is a group of contiguous scalars), blocks are clustered based on their statistics, and a dedicated optimal quantization codebook is designed for each cluster. As a specific embodiment of this approach, we propose a PTQ algorithm called Locally-Optimal BCQ (LO-BCQ) that iterates between the steps of block clustering and codebook design to greedily minimize the quantization mean squared error. When weight and activation scalars are encoded to W4A4 format (with 0.5-bits of overhead for storing scaling factors and codebook selectors), we advance the current state-of-the-art by demonstrating <1% loss in inference accuracy across several LLMs and downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

However, long-tail knowledge from specialized domains is often scarce and underrepresented, rarely appearing in the models' memorization. Prior work has shown that in-context learning (ICL) with retriever augmentation can help LLMs better capture long-tail knowledge, reducing their reliance on pre-trained data. Despite these advances, we observe that LLM predictions for long-tail questions remain uncertain to variations in retrieved samples. To take advantage of the uncertainty in ICL for guiding LLM predictions toward correct answers on long-tail samples, we propose a reinforcement learning-based dynamic uncertainty ranking method for ICL that accounts for the varying impact of each retrieved sample on LLM predictions. Our approach prioritizes more informative and stable samples while demoting misleading ones, updating rankings based on the feedback from the LLM w.r.t. each retrieved sample. To enhance training efficiency and reduce query costs, we introduce a learnable dynamic ranking threshold, adjusted when the model encounters negative prediction shifts. Experimental results on various question-answering datasets from different domains show that our method outperforms the best baseline by $2.76\%$, with a notable $5.96\%$ boost in accuracy on long-tail questions that elude zero-shot inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method to trace and quantify these biases using fine-tuned LLMs. We develop BookPAGE, a corpus comprising 593 fictional books across seven decades (1950-2019), to track bias evolution. By fine-tuning LLMs on books from each decade and using targeted prompts, we examine shifts in biases related to gender, sexual orientation, race, and religion. Our findings indicate that LLMs trained on decade-specific books manifest biases reflective of their times, with both gradual trends and notable shifts. For example, model responses showed a progressive increase in the portrayal of women in leadership roles (from 8% to 22%) from the 1950s to 2010s, with a significant uptick in the 1990s (from 4% to 12%), possibly aligning with third-wave feminism. Same-sex relationship references increased markedly from the 1980s to 2000s (from 0% to 10%), mirroring growing LGBTQ+ visibility. Concerningly, negative portrayals of Islam rose sharply in the 2000s (26% to 38%), likely reflecting post-9/11 sentiments. Importantly, we demonstrate that these biases stem mainly from the books' content and not the models' architecture or initial training. Our study offers a new perspective on societal bias trends by bridging AI, literary studies, and social science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.</p></details> |  |

We are Not There Yet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05291v1)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.05291v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While substantial safety data exist in English, multilingual guardrail modeling remains underexplored due to the scarcity of open-source safety data in other languages. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where a generator and a guardrail model co-evolve adversarially to produce high-quality synthetic data for multilingual guardrail training. We theoretically formalize this interaction as a two-player game, proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations show that our model \ours outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving nearly 10% improvement over LlamaGuard3 (8B) on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a significantly smaller model (0.5B). We achieve substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks, particularly in addressing the imbalance for lower-resource languages in a collected real dataset. Ablation studies emphasize the critical role of synthetic data generation in bridging the imbalance in open-source data between English and other languages. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach to synthetic data generation, paving the way for improved multilingual guardrail models to enhance LLM safety.

Although methods like differential privacy or neuron editing can reduce memorization, they typically require costly retraining or direct access to model weights and may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc approach that replaces the probabilities of grammar-related tokens with those from a small auxiliary model (e.g., DistilGPT-2). We run extensive experiments on commercial grade models such as Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b and demonstrate that our method effectively reduces well-known cases of memorized generation by upto 10x with little to no impact on downstream tasks.

Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed to analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in principles of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information theory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through constituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse definition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights into transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No specific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on their constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which intensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with these interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This fragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and architectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures regarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability, underscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 Figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

On a separate test set, our approach increases prediction accuracy of Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B by between 7--10\% over a base model and a DPO fine-tuned control model with randomized labels, bringing them on par with forecasting capabilities of much larger frontier models like GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

However, to tackle the most challenging intellectual problems, LLMs must reason effectively in long and complex contexts (e.g., frontier mathematical research). Studying how LLMs handle increasing reasoning complexity and context length is essential, yet existing benchmarks lack a solid basis for quantitative evaluation. Inspired by the abstraction of GSM-8K problems as computational graphs, and the ability to introduce noise by adding unnecessary nodes and edges, we develop a grade school math problem generator capable of producing arithmetic problems with infinite difficulty and context length under fine-grained control. Using our newly synthesized GSM-Infinite benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate existing LLMs. We find a consistent sigmoid decline in reasoning performance as complexity increases, along with a systematic inference scaling trend: exponentially increasing inference computation yields only linear performance gains. These findings underscore the fundamental limitations of current long-context LLMs and the key challenges in scaling reasoning capabilities. Our GSM-Infinite benchmark provides a scalable and controllable testbed for systematically studying and advancing LLM reasoning in long and complex contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns about hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs, enabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters in memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical parameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant challenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are inherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we challenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as three bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with billions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting this vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical parameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose AttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient traversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally, we introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine the search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and effective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs to AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of total parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result in a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to 0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings underscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting critical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.</p></details> |  |

While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330v2) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations. We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST.</p></details> |  |

Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code from natural language, their output is often error-prone, particularly when scripting interactions among multiple elements. The linear conversational structure limits the editing of individual elements, and lacking graphical and precise control complicates visual integration. To address these issues, we integrate an element-level modularization technique that processes textual descriptions for individual elements through separate LLM modules, with a central module managing interactions among elements. This modular approach allows for refining each element independently. We design a graphical user interface, MoGraphGPT , which combines modular LLMs with enhanced graphical control to generate codes for 2D interactive scenes. It enables direct integration of graphical information and offers quick, precise control through automatically generated sliders. Our comparative evaluation against an AI coding tool, Cursor Composer, as the baseline system and a usability study show MoGraphGPT significantly improves easiness, controllability, and refinement in creating complex 2D interactive scenes with multiple visual elements in a coding-free manner.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal.

| **[Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418v3)** | 2025-02-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.00418v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction. Our framework generates meshes with complex details, well-structured geometry, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing and eye-catching designs.

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods.

Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture.

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images. Our method clearly outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page is available at: https://ygswu.github.io/NeuroPump.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project.

In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ACCV2024</p></details> |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

While recent diffusion-based restoration methods, which leverage generative priors from text-to-image models, have made progress in recovering more realistic details, they still encounter "generative capability deactivation" when applied to out-of-distribution real-world data. To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Res-Captioner significantly enhances the generalization abilities of diffusion-based restoration models, while remaining fully plug-and-play.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization.

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |

However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications.

To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a plug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation. Code: https://github.com/TitorX/GVCFDiffusion</p></details> |  |

Several layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a wide range of layouts, such as segmentation maps, edges, and human keypoints. In this work, we propose ObjectDiffusion, a model that conditions T2I diffusion models on semantic and spatial grounding information, enabling the precise rendering and placement of desired objects in specific locations defined by bounding boxes. To achieve this, we make substantial modifications to the network architecture introduced in ControlNet to integrate it with the grounding method proposed in GLIGEN. We fine-tune ObjectDiffusion on the COCO2017 training dataset and evaluate it on the COCO2017 validation dataset. Our model improves the precision and quality of controllable image generation, achieving an AP$_{\text{50}}$ of 46.6, an AR of 44.5, and an FID of 19.8, outperforming the current SOTA model trained on open-source datasets across all three metrics. ObjectDiffusion demonstrates a distinctive capability in synthesizing diverse, high-quality, high-fidelity images that seamlessly conform to the semantic and spatial control layout. Evaluated in qualitative and quantitative tests, ObjectDiffusion exhibits remarkable grounding capabilities in closed-set and open-set vocabulary settings across a wide variety of contexts. The qualitative assessment verifies the ability of ObjectDiffusion to generate multiple detailed objects in varying sizes, forms, and locations.</p></details> |  |

Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.</p></details> |  |

It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p></details> |  |

While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness.

We present MaterialFusion, a novel framework for high-quality material transfer that allows users to adjust the degree of material application, achieving an optimal balance between new material properties and the object's original features. MaterialFusion seamlessly integrates the modified object into the scene by maintaining background consistency and mitigating boundary artifacts. To thoroughly evaluate our approach, we have compiled a dataset of real-world material transfer examples and conducted complex comparative analyses. Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and user studies, we demonstrate that MaterialFusion significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of quality, user control, and background preservation.

Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases.

While diffusion models have shown stability and high-quality generation in natural images, there is increasing interest in adapting them to analyze brain data for various neurological tasks such as data enhancement, disease diagnosis and brain decoding. This survey provides an overview of recent efforts to integrate diffusion models into computational neuroimaging. We begin by introducing the common neuroimaging data modalities, follow with the diffusion formulations and conditioning mechanisms. Then we discuss how the variations of the denoising starting point, condition input and generation target of diffusion models are developed and enhance specific neuroimaging tasks.

While Gaussian-based models succeed within a unified SDE framework, recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed noise distributions, like $\alpha$-stable distributions, may better handle mode collapse and effectively manage datasets exhibiting class imbalance, heavy tails, or prominent outliers. Recently, Yoon et al.\ (NeurIPS 2023), presented the L\'evy-It\^o model (LIM), directly extending the SDE-based framework to a class of heavy-tailed SDEs, where the injected noise followed an $\alpha$-stable distribution, a rich class of heavy-tailed distributions. However, the LIM framework relies on highly involved mathematical techniques with limited flexibility, potentially hindering broader adoption and further development. In this study, instead of starting from the SDE formulation, we extend the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) by replacing the Gaussian noise with $\alpha$-stable noise. By using only elementary proof techniques, the proposed approach, Denoising L\'evy Probabilistic Models (DLPM), boils down to vanilla DDPM with minor modifications. As opposed to the Gaussian case, DLPM and LIM yield different training algorithms and different backward processes, leading to distinct sampling algorithms. These fundamental differences translate favorably for DLPM as compared to LIM: our experiments show improvements in coverage of data distribution tails, better robustness to unbalanced datasets, and improved computation times requiring smaller number of backward steps.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) and VARs (e.g., Infinity) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we explore safety fine-tuning of the text encoder underlying major DM architectures using a customized dataset. Thereby, we suppress NSFW generation while preserving overall image and text generation quality. Finally, to advance research in this area, we introduce ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. ToxicBench provides a curated dataset of harmful prompts, new metrics, and an evaluation pipeline assessing both NSFW-ness and generation quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models.</p></details> |  |

To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |

However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.</p></details> |  |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, the slow inference speeds limit their potential for broader real-world applications. Here, we introduce Habi, a general framework that transforms powerful but slow diffusion planning models into fast decision-making models, which mimics the cognitive process in the brain that costly goal-directed behavior gradually transitions to efficient habitual behavior with repetitive practice. Even using a laptop CPU, the habitized model can achieve an average 800+ Hz decision-making frequency (faster than previous diffusion planners by orders of magnitude) on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks D4RL, while maintaining comparable or even higher performance compared to its corresponding diffusion planner. Our work proposes a fresh perspective of leveraging powerful diffusion models for real-world decision-making tasks. We also provide robust evaluations and analysis, offering insights from both biological and engineering perspectives for efficient and effective decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Existing text or image-guided generation methods fail to handle the richness and complexity of diverse styles. We present TANGLED, a novel approach for 3D hair strand generation that accommodates diverse image inputs across styles, viewpoints, and quantities of input views. TANGLED employs a three-step pipeline. First, our MultiHair Dataset provides 457 diverse hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes, emphasizing complex and culturally significant styles to improve model generalization. Second, we propose a diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts that can capture topological cues (e.g., strand density and parting lines) while filtering out noise. By leveraging a latent diffusion model with cross-attention on lineart features, our method achieves flexible and robust 3D hair generation across diverse input conditions. Third, a parametric post-processing module enforces braid-specific constraints to maintain coherence in complex structures. This framework not only advances hairstyle realism and diversity but also enables culturally inclusive digital avatars and novel applications like sketch-based 3D strand editing for animation and augmented reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/tangled1</p></details> |

Recent methods adopt learning-based approaches to implicitly capture priors, but the priors primarily fit in-domain data and do not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a zero-shot depth completion method composed of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment. We use pre-trained depth diffusion models as depth prior knowledge, which implicitly understand how to fill in depth for scenes. Our approach aligns the affine-invariant depth prior with metric-scale sparse measurements, enforcing them as hard constraints via an optimization loop at test-time. Our zero-shot depth completion method demonstrates generalization across various domain datasets, achieving up to a 21\% average performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods while enhancing spatial understanding by sharpening scene details. We demonstrate that aligning a monocular affine-invariant depth prior with sparse metric measurements is a proven strategy to achieve domain-generalizable depth completion without relying on extensive training data.

Generative models that handle multiple distortions frequently struggle with phone reconstruction and high-frequency harmonics, leading to breathing and gasping artifacts that reduce the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. These models are also computationally demanding, and many solutions are restricted to producing outputs in the wide-band frequency range, which limits their suitability for professional applications. To address these challenges, we propose Hi-ResLDM, a novel generative model based on latent diffusion designed to remove multiple distortions and restore speech recordings to studio quality, sampled at 48kHz. We benchmark Hi-ResLDM against state-of-the-art methods that leverage GAN and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) components, demonstrating superior performance in regenerating high-frequency-band details. Hi-ResLDM not only excels in non-instrusive metrics but is also consistently preferred in human evaluation and performs competitively on intrusive evaluations, making it ideal for high-resolution speech restoration.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches for memory mitigation either only focused on the text modality problem in cross-modal generation tasks or utilized data augmentation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. To facilitate forgetting of stored information in diffusion model parameters, we propose an iterative ensemble training strategy by splitting the data into multiple shards for training multiple models and intermittently aggregating these model parameters. Moreover, practical analysis of losses illustrates that the training loss for easily memorable images tends to be obviously lower. Thus, we propose an anti-gradient control method to exclude the sample with a lower loss value from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, and results show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while even improving the performance slightly. Moreover, to save the computing cost, we successfully apply our method to fine-tune the well-trained diffusion models by limited epochs, demonstrating the applicability of our method.

Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model to handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humanaigc.github.io/animate-anyone-2/</p></details> |

However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.

We consider a robot equipped with joint torque sensors and a force/torque sensor at the base. By leveraging a diffusion model, CDM addresses the singularity where multiple pairs of contact points and forces produce identical sensor measurements. We formulate CDM to be conditioned on past model outputs to account for the time-dependent characteristics of the multi-contact scenarios. Moreover, to effectively address the complex shape of the robot surfaces, we incorporate the signed distance field in the denoising process. Consequently, CDM can localize contacts at arbitrary locations with high accuracy. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, CDM operates at 15.97ms and, in the real world, achieves an error of 0.44cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24cm in dual-contact scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta, USA</p></details> |

Often, there is a need to target specific regions of the data distribution. Current guidance methods aim to sample from a distribution with mass proportional to $p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha$ but fail to achieve this in practice. We introduce a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that generates unbiasedly from this target distribution, utilising the learnt unconditional and guided process. We validate our approach on low-dimensional distributions, controlled images and text generations. For text generation, our method provides strong control while maintaining low perplexity compared to guidance-based approaches.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

In this manuscript, we develop a novel generative artificial intelligence (genAI) method DiffSMol to facilitate drug development. DiffSmol generates 3D binding molecules based on the shapes of known ligands. DiffSMol encapsulates geometric details of ligand shapes within pre-trained, expressive shape embeddings and then generates new binding molecules through a diffusion model. DiffSMol further modifies the generated 3D structures iteratively via shape guidance to better resemble the ligand shapes. It also tailors the generated molecules toward optimal binding affinities under the guidance of protein pockets. Here, we show that DiffSMol outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. When generating binding molecules resembling ligand shapes, DiffSMol with shape guidance achieves a success rate 61.4%, substantially outperforming the best baseline (11.2%), meanwhile producing molecules with novel molecular graph structures. DiffSMol with pocket guidance also outperforms the best baseline in binding affinities by 13.2%, and even by 17.7% when combined with shape guidance. Case studies for two critical drug targets demonstrate very favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the generated molecules, thus, the potential of DiffSMol in developing promising drug candidates.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, existing preference datasets often exhibit overlap between these distributions, leading to a conflict distribution. Additionally, we identified that input prompts contain irrelevant information for less preferred images, limiting the denoising network's ability to accurately predict noise in preference optimization methods, known as the irrelevant prompt issue. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a novel approach that utilizes two distinct captions to mitigate irrelevant prompts. To tackle conflict distribution, we introduce the Pick-Double Caption dataset, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for preferred and less preferred images. We further propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</p></details> |  |

This limitation persists due to the intractability of the likelihood score, which until now has only been approximated in the simpler case of Gaussian likelihoods. In this work, we extend diffusion models to handle inverse problems where the observations follow a distribution from the exponential family, such as a Poisson or a Binomial distribution. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of exponential family distributions, we introduce the evidence trick, a method that provides a tractable approximation to the likelihood score. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methodology effectively performs Bayesian inference on spatially inhomogeneous Poisson processes with intensities as intricate as ImageNet images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the real-world impact of our methodology by showing that it performs competitively with the current state-of-the-art in predicting malaria prevalence estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p></details> |  |

Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g. prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</p></details> |  |

However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

This book begins with a detailed introduction to the fundamental principles and historical development of GANs, contrasting them with traditional generative models and elucidating the core adversarial mechanisms through illustrative Python examples. The text systematically addresses the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings including probability theory, statistics, and game theory providing a solid framework for understanding the objectives, loss functions, and optimisation challenges inherent to GAN training. Subsequent chapters review classic variants such as Conditional GANs, DCGANs, InfoGAN, and LAPGAN before progressing to advanced training methodologies like Wasserstein GANs, GANs with gradient penalty, least squares GANs, and spectral normalisation techniques. The book further examines architectural enhancements and task-specific adaptations in generators and discriminators, showcasing practical implementations in high resolution image generation, artistic style transfer, video synthesis, text to image generation and other multimedia applications. The concluding sections offer insights into emerging research trends, including self-attention mechanisms, transformer-based generative models, and a comparative analysis with diffusion models, thus charting promising directions for future developments in both academic and applied settings.</p></details> |  |

However, diffusion models still face challenges in controlling specific attributes and preserving the consistency of other unchanged attributes especially the identity characteristics. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion (SD) models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involves the combinations of target background, identity and face attributes aimed to edit. We strive to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable consistency of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Attribute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) A high-consistency FaceFusion method that transfers identity features from the Identity Encoder to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained SD model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.

Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. Here, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We use the forward process of the diffusion model to add additional auxiliary observations and then perform an SMC sampling as part of the backward process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of our approach over competing methods on various inverse problem tasks.</p></details> |  |

Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

This reliance on synthetic data can also be intentional, as seen in Rectified Flow models, whose Reflow method iteratively uses self-generated data to straighten the flow and improve sampling efficiency. However, recent studies have shown that repeatedly training on self-generated samples can lead to model collapse (MC), where performance degrades over time. Despite this, most recent work on MC either focuses on empirical observations or analyzes regression problems and maximum likelihood objectives, leaving a rigorous theoretical analysis of reflow methods unexplored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing both theoretical analysis and practical solutions for addressing MC in diffusion/flow models. We begin by studying Denoising Autoencoders and prove performance degradation when DAEs are iteratively trained on their own outputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to rigorously analyze model collapse in DAEs and, by extension, in diffusion models and Rectified Flow. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that rectified flow also suffers from MC, leading to potential performance degradation in each reflow step. Additionally, we prove that incorporating real data can prevent MC during recursive DAE training, supporting the recent trend of using real data as an effective approach for mitigating MC. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Real-data Augmented Reflow and a series of improved variants, which seamlessly integrate real data into Reflow training by leveraging reverse flow. Empirical evaluations on standard image benchmarks confirm that RA Reflow effectively mitigates model collapse, preserving high-quality sample generation even with fewer sampling steps.</p></details> |  |

However, recent findings suggest that image likelihood does not align with perceptual quality: high-likelihood samples tend to be smooth, while lower-likelihood ones are more detailed. Controlling sample density is thus crucial for balancing realism and detail. In this paper, we analyze an existing technique, Prior Guidance, which scales the latent code to influence image detail. We introduce score alignment, a condition that explains why this method works and show that it can be tractably checked for any continuous normalizing flow model. We then propose Density Guidance, a principled modification of the generative ODE that enables exact log-density control during sampling. Finally, we extend Density Guidance to stochastic sampling, ensuring precise log-density control while allowing controlled variation in structure or fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques provide fine-grained control over image detail without compromising sample quality.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |

Among these, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been employed as key generative image completion approaches, excelling in the field of generating high-quality restorations with reduced artifacts and improved fine details. In previous work, we developed a method aimed at synthesizing views from novel microscope positions for mastoidectomy surgeries; however, that approach did not have the ability to restore the surrounding surgical scene environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to complete the surgical scene of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning on real surgical datasets to train a Single-Step Denoising Diffusion-GAN (SSDD-GAN), combining the advantages of diffusion models with the adversarial optimization of GANs for improved Structural Similarity results of 6%. The trained model is then directly applied to the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset using a zero-shot approach, enabling the generation of realistic and complete surgical scenes without the need for explicit ground-truth labels from the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. This method addresses key limitations in previous work, offering a novel pathway for full surgical microscopy scene completion and enhancing the usability of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset in surgical preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation.</p></details> |  |

This task is difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation. Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models offer new possibilities for augmenting classification datasets. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on Text2Image generation or Img2Img methods, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and recent generative data augmentation methods. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training, contextual bias, and few-shot classification. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality.

However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score.

Although Bayesian filtering has been the cornerstone solution, its classical model-based paradigm faces two major limitations: it struggles with inaccurate state space model (SSM) and requires extensive prior knowledge of noise characteristics. We present TrackDiffuser, a generative framework addressing both challenges by reformulating Bayesian filtering as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach implicitly learns system dynamics from data to mitigate the effects of inaccurate SSM, while simultaneously circumventing the need for explicit measurement models and noise priors by establishing a direct relationship between measurements and states. Through an implicit predict-and-update mechanism, TrackDiffuser preserves the interpretability advantage of traditional model-based filtering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms both classical and contemporary hybrid methods, especially in challenging non-linear scenarios involving non-Gaussian noises. Notably, TrackDiffuser exhibits remarkable robustness to SSM inaccuracies, offering a practical solution for real-world state estimation problems where perfect models and prior knowledge are unavailable.</p></details> |  |

Without this grounding, the deployment of such models in critical applications, ranging from material science to safety-critical systems, remains impractical. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing a novel approach to integrate stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling them to generate outputs that satisfy stringent physical and functional requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through material science experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, inverse design problems involving the generation of stress-strain responses using video generation with a simulator in the loop, and safety settings where outputs must avoid copyright infringement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Probabilistic Diffusion Models With Optimal Diagonal Covariance Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10808v3)** | 2025-02-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.10808v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The probabilistic diffusion model has become highly effective across various domains. Typically, sampling from a diffusion model involves using a denoising distribution characterized by a Gaussian with a learned mean and either fixed or learned covariances. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed covariance moment matching technique and introduce a novel method for learning the diagonal covariance. Unlike traditional data-driven diagonal covariance approximation approaches, our method involves directly regressing the optimal diagonal analytic covariance using a new, unbiased objective named Optimal Covariance Matching (OCM). This approach can significantly reduce the approximation error in covariance prediction. We demonstrate how our method can substantially enhance the sampling efficiency, recall rate and likelihood of commonly used diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize attention mechanisms to generate interest representations by aggregating historical item embeddings. However, these methods only capture overall item-level relevance, leading to coarse-grained interest representations that include irrelevant information. To address this issue, we propose the Diffusion Multi-Interest model (DMI), a novel framework for refining user interest representations at the dimension level. Specifically, DMI first introduces controllable noise into coarse-grained interest representations at the dimensional level. Then, in the iterative reconstruction process, DMI combines a cross-attention mechanism and an item pruning strategy to reconstruct the personalized interest vectors with the guidance of tailored collaborative information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DMI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Successfully deployed in the real-world recommender system, DMI effectively enhances user satisfaction and system performance at scale, serving the major traffic of hundreds of millions of daily active users. \footnote{The code will be released for reproducibility once the paper is accepted.}</p></details> |  |

AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

Additionally, the trained model can be employed to sample configurations on different lattice sizes without requiring further training. The exactness of the generated samples is ensured by incorporating Metropolis-adjusted Langevin dynamics into the generation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach enables more efficient sampling of topological quantities compared to traditional algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo and Langevin simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, comments are welcome!

We introduce a benchmark designed specifically to assess the Physical Coherence of generated videos, PhyCoBench. Our benchmark includes 120 prompts covering 7 categories of physical principles, capturing key physical laws observable in video content. We evaluated four state-of-the-art (SoTA) T2V models on PhyCoBench and conducted manual assessments. Additionally, we propose an automated evaluation model: PhyCoPredictor, a diffusion model that generates optical flow and video frames in a cascade manner. Through a consistency evaluation comparing automated and manual sorting, the experimental results show that PhyCoPredictor currently aligns most closely with human evaluation. Therefore, it can effectively evaluate the physical coherence of videos, providing insights for future model optimization. Our benchmark, which includes physical coherence prompts, automatic evaluation tool PhyCoPredictor, and generated video dataset, will all be released on GitHub shortly.</p></details> |  |

A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain an FID of $6.31$ on CIFAR-10 with just $4\%$ clean images (and $3.58$ with $10\%$). Theoretically, we prove that SFBD guides the model to learn the true data distribution. The result also highlights the importance of pretraining on limited but clean data or the alternative from similar datasets. Empirical studies further support these findings and offer additional insights.</p></details> |  |

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

Current un-/weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks trained only on healthy data; however GAN-based networks are more challenging to train due to issues with simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, etc. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised Implicitly guided COuNterfactual diffusion model for Detecting Anomalies in PET images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases containing both local and public datasets. The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUVmax thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies.

The inference of Show-o involves progressively denoising image tokens and autoregressively decoding text tokens, and hence, unfortunately, suffers from inefficiency issues from both sides. This paper introduces Show-o Turbo to bridge the gap. We first identify a unified denoising perspective for the generation of images and text in Show-o based on the parallel decoding of text tokens. We then propose to extend consistency distillation (CD), a qualified approach for shortening the denoising process of diffusion models, to the multimodal denoising trajectories of Show-o. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy and a curriculum learning procedure to improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, Show-o Turbo displays a GenEval score of 0.625 at 4 sampling steps without using classifier-free guidance (CFG), outperforming that of the original Show-o with 8 steps and CFG; in image-to-text generation, Show-o Turbo exhibits a 1.5x speedup without significantly sacrificing performance.

However, recent Consistency Models (CMs), which offer fewer function evaluations, rely on distilling CFG knowledge from pretrained DMs to achieve guidance, making them costly and inflexible. In this work, we propose invertible Guided Consistency Training (iGCT), a novel training framework for guided CMs that is entirely data-driven. iGCT, as a pioneering work, contributes to fast and guided image generation and editing without requiring the training and distillation of DMs, greatly reducing the overall compute requirements. iGCT addresses the saturation artifacts seen in CFG under high guidance scales. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet64 show that iGCT significantly improves FID and precision compared to CFG. At a guidance of 13, iGCT improves precision to 0.8, while DM's drops to 0.47. Our work takes the first step toward enabling guidance and inversion for CMs without relying on DMs.</p></details> |  |

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output before committing to full resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability .</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Hummingbird, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets.

However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as "two dogs" or "a penguin on the right of a bowl". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3% and 19.5% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-{\alpha}, respectively. Spatial composition sees even larger gains, with 60.7% for Stable Diffusion and 21.1% for PixArt-{\alpha}.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking strategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph learning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we investigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification framework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model to learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed structures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured predictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the forward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which structure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during the forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism to selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment between the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse process, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer entropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster at WWW 2025</p></details> |

Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.</p></details> |  |

An effective approach to achieve this goal is through behavior regularization, which augments conventional RL objectives by incorporating constraints that enforce the policy to remain close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.</p></details> | Under review |

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships.

| **[Can Diffusion Models Learn Hidden Inter-Feature Rules Behind Images?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04725v1)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04725v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models (DMs) in data generation, they exhibit specific failure cases with unsatisfactory outputs. We focus on one such limitation: the ability of DMs to learn hidden rules between image features. Specifically, for image data with dependent features ($\mathbf{x}$) and ($\mathbf{y}$) (e.g., the height of the sun ($\mathbf{x}$) and the length of the shadow ($\mathbf{y}$)), we investigate whether DMs can accurately capture the inter-feature rule ($p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$). Empirical evaluations on mainstream DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3.5) reveal consistent failures, such as inconsistent lighting-shadow relationships and mismatched object-mirror reflections. Inspired by these findings, we design four synthetic tasks with strongly correlated features to assess DMs' rule-learning abilities. Extensive experiments show that while DMs can identify coarse-grained rules, they struggle with fine-grained ones. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that DMs trained via denoising score matching (DSM) exhibit constant errors in learning hidden rules, as the DSM objective is not compatible with rule conformity. To mitigate this, we introduce a common technique - incorporating additional classifier guidance during sampling, which achieves (limited) improvements. Our analysis reveals that the subtle signals of fine-grained rules are challenging for the classifier to capture, providing insights for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances phenotype prediction accuracy across species, capturing subtle genetic variations that contribute to observable traits.</p></details> |  |

However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

A pivotal component of these models is the noise schedule, which governs the rate of noise injection during the diffusion process.

In this discussion, various noise schedules are examined, and their distinguishing features and performance characteristics are highlighted.</p></details> |  |

We derive an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) that introduces a planner to select which tokens to unmask at each step. Our analysis reveals that alternative unmasking strategies can enhance generation performance. Building on this, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that uses a pre-trained BERT model or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and significantly improves performance across diverse domains, including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding Conditional Control to Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12120v2)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.12120v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are powerful generative models that allow for precise control over the characteristics of the generated samples. While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls.

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to "work". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. Finally, we connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v1)** | 2025-02-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04507v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provable Sample-Efficient Transfer Learning Conditional Diffusion Models via Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04491v1)** | 2025-02-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04491v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Introducing 3D Representation for Medical Image Volume-to-Volume Translation via Score Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07430v2)** | 2025-02-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.07430v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In volume-to-volume translations in medical images, existing models often struggle to capture the inherent volumetric distribution using 3D voxelspace representations, due to high computational dataset demands. We present Score-Fusion, a novel volumetric translation model that effectively learns 3D representations by ensembling perpendicularly trained 2D diffusion models in score function space. By carefully initializing our model to start with an average of 2D models as in TPDM, we reduce 3D training to a fine-tuning process and thereby mitigate both computational and data demands. Furthermore, we explicitly design the 3D model's hierarchical layers to learn ensembles of 2D features, further enhancing efficiency and performance. Moreover, Score-Fusion naturally extends to multi-modality settings, by fusing diffusion models conditioned on different inputs for flexible, accurate integration. We demonstrate that 3D representation is essential for better performance in downstream recognition tasks, such as tumor segmentation, where most segmentation models are based on 3D representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Score-Fusion achieves superior accuracy and volumetric fidelity in 3D medical image super-resolution and modality translation. Beyond these improvements, our work also provides broader insight into learning-based approaches for score function fusion.</p></details> |  |

However, the AR modeling paradigm presents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs are trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable latency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can enhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code generation, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during inference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are capable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the performance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language understanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation method for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference steps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale, diffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is up to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate further improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M parameters.</p></details> |  |

The acquisition time of high-resolution NMR spectra remains a significant bottleneck, especially for complex biological samples such as proteins. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient sub-sampling strategy based on a diffusion model trained on protein NMR data. Our method iteratively reconstructs under-sampled spectra while using model uncertainty to guide subsequent sampling, significantly reducing acquisition time. Compared to state-of-the-art strategies, our approach improves reconstruction accuracy by 52.9\%, reduces hallucinated peaks by 55.6%, and requires 60% less time in complex NMR experiments. This advancement holds promise for many applications, from drug discovery to materials science, where rapid and high-resolution spectral analysis is critical.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models have recently made significant achievements in graph generation, these models typically adapt from the frameworks designed for image generation, making them ill-suited for capturing the topological properties of graphs. In this work, we propose a novel Higher-order Guided Diffusion (HOG-Diff) model that follows a coarse-to-fine generation curriculum and is guided by higher-order information, enabling the progressive generation of plausible graphs with inherent topological structures. We further prove that our model exhibits a stronger theoretical guarantee than classical diffusion frameworks. Extensive experiments on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms or remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines.

Shot design, a critical aspect of filmmaking, involves meticulously planning both camera movements and object motions in a scene. However, enabling intuitive shot design in modern image-to-video generation systems presents two main challenges: first, effectively capturing user intentions on the motion design, where both camera movements and scene-space object motions must be specified jointly; and second, representing motion information that can be effectively utilized by a video diffusion model to synthesize the image animations. To address these challenges, we introduce MotionCanvas, a method that integrates user-driven controls into image-to-video (I2V) generation models, allowing users to control both object and camera motions in a scene-aware manner. By connecting insights from classical computer graphics and contemporary video generation techniques, we demonstrate the ability to achieve 3D-aware motion control in I2V synthesis without requiring costly 3D-related training data. MotionCanvas enables users to intuitively depict scene-space motion intentions, and translates them into spatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for video diffusion models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a wide range of real-world image content and shot-design scenarios, highlighting its potential to enhance the creative workflows in digital content creation and adapt to various image and video editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>It is...</summary><p>It is best viewed in Acrobat.

Disentanglement arises in several generative paradigms including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks and diffusion models. Recent progress has been made in understanding disentanglement in VAEs, where a choice of diagonal posterior covariance matrices is shown to promote mutual orthogonality between columns of the decoder's Jacobian. We build on this to show how such orthogonality, a geometric property, translates to disentanglement, a statistical property, furthering our understanding of how a VAE identifies independent components of, or disentangles, the data.</p></details> |  |

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational complexity imposes significant limitations on real-time applications and sustainability of AI systems. In this study, we aim to enhance the computational efficiency through model quantization, which represents the weights and activation values with lower precision. Multi-region quantization (MRQ) is introduced to address the asymmetric distribution of network values in DiT blocks by allocating two scaling parameters to sub-regions. Additionally, time-grouping quantization (TGQ) is proposed to reduce quantization error caused by temporal variation in activations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the original full-precision model with only a 0.29 increase in FID at W8A8. Furthermore, it outperforms other baselines at W6A6, thereby confirming its suitability for low-bit quantization.

Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 77-90% of the time in conducted user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://partedit.github.io/PartEdit/</p></details> |

These models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate highly artistic and intricately detailed images based on textual prompts. However, obtaining desired generation outcomes often necessitates repetitive trials of manipulating text prompts just like casting spells on a magic mirror, and the reason behind that is the limited capability of semantic understanding inherent in current image generation models. Specifically, existing diffusion models encode the text prompt input with a pre-trained encoder structure, which is usually trained on a limited number of image-caption pairs. The state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) based on the decoder-only structure have shown a powerful semantic understanding capability as their architectures are more suitable for training on very large-scale unlabeled data. In this work, we propose to enhance text-to-image diffusion models by borrowing the strength of semantic understanding from large language models, and devise a simple yet effective adapter to allow the diffusion models to be compatible with the decoder-only structure. Meanwhile, we also provide a supporting theoretical analysis with various architectures (e.g., encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only), and conduct extensive empirical evaluations to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the enhanced models with our adapter module are superior to the stat-of-the-art models in terms of text-to-image generation quality and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Most current deterministic inversion techniques operate by approximately solving an implicit equation and may converge slowly or yield poor reconstructed images. We formulate the problem by finding the roots of an implicit equation and devlop a method to solve it efficiently. Our solution is based on Newton-Raphson (NR), a well-known technique in numerical analysis. We show that a vanilla application of NR is computationally infeasible while naively transforming it to a computationally tractable alternative tends to converge to out-of-distribution solutions, resulting in poor reconstruction and editing. We therefore derive an efficient guided formulation that fastly converges and provides high-quality reconstructions and editing. We showcase our method on real image editing with three popular open-sourced diffusion models: Stable Diffusion, SDXL-Turbo, and Flux with different deterministic schedulers. Our solution, Guided Newton-Raphson Inversion, inverts an image within 0.4 sec (on an A100 GPU) for few-step models (SDXL-Turbo and Flux.1), opening the door for interactive image editing.

However, directly using a blurry image or pre-deblurred one as a conditional control for SD will either hinder accurate structure extraction or make the results overly dependent on the deblurring network. In this work, we propose a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) to achieve robust real-world image deblurring. Specifically, we co-train the LKPN in latent space with conditional diffusion. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel to guide the restoration of sharp images in the latent space. By applying element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), the learned kernel is utilized to adaptively process the input feature, effectively preserving the structural information of the input. This process thereby more effectively guides the generative process of Stable Diffusion (SD), enhancing both the deblurring efficacy and the quality of detail reconstruction. Moreover, the results at each diffusion step are utilized to iteratively estimate the kernels in LKPN to better restore the sharp latent by EAC. This iterative refinement enhances the accuracy and robustness of the deblurring process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on both benchmark and real-world images.</p></details> |  |

Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training of the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, the offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in the real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

To address this, various safety mechanisms and red teaming attack methods are proposed to enhance or expose the T2I model's capability to generate unsuitable content. However, many red teaming attack methods assume knowledge of the text encoders, limiting their practical usage. In this work, we rethink the case of \textit{purely black-box} attacks without prior knowledge of the T2l model. To overcome the unavailability of gradients and the inability to optimize attacks within a discrete prompt space, we propose DiffZOO which applies Zeroth Order Optimization to procure gradient approximations and harnesses both C-PRV and D-PRV to enhance attack prompts within the discrete prompt domain. We evaluated our method across multiple safety mechanisms of the T2I diffusion model and online servers. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art safety mechanisms show that DiffZOO attains an 8.5% higher average attack success rate than previous works, hence its promise as a practical red teaming tool for T2l models.</p></details> |  |

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, using CFG introduces significant computational overhead and deviates from the established theoretical foundations of diffusion models. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by enhancing text Embeddings (DICE), a novel approach that removes the reliance on CFG in the generative process while maintaining the benefits it provides. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational and theoretical drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, DICE supports negative prompts for image editing to improve image quality further. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

However, the practical implementations of these models have also exposed inherent risks, bringing to the forefront their evil sides and sparking concerns regarding their trustworthiness. Despite the wealth of literature on this subject, a comprehensive survey specifically delving into the intersection of large-scale generative models and their trustworthiness remains largely absent. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates both the long-standing and emerging threats associated with these models across four fundamental dimensions: 1) privacy, 2) security, 3) fairness, and 4) responsibility. Based on the investigation results, we develop an extensive map outlining the trustworthiness of large generative models. After that, we provide practical recommendations and potential research directions for future secure applications equipped with large generative models, ultimately promoting the trustworthiness of the models and benefiting the society as a whole.</p></details> | Accepted to IJCV |

We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

However, assessing their safety and effectiveness remains challenging because it is difficult to test all the different ways a single task can be phrased. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models fail or behave unsafely on ERT-generated instructions, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

Conformal Predictions (CP), which provide label sets with rigorous guarantees on ground truth inclusion probabilities, have recently gained traction as a valuable tool in HITL settings. One key application area is video surveillance, closely associated with Human Action Recognition (HAR). This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data. Our code is made available on GitHub at the address https://github.com/tbary/CP4VLM.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles $\unicode{x2013}$ directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions. To support further research, we use public datasets and will release our code and preprocessing pipeline, providing a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models</p></details> |

Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios.

These agents aim to execute human instructions on smartphones by interpreting textual instructions and performing actions via the device's interface. While promising, current approaches face significant limitations. Methods that use large proprietary models, such as GPT-4o, are computationally expensive, while those that use smaller fine-tuned models often lack adaptability to out-of-distribution tasks. In this work, we introduce AppVLM, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM). First, we fine-tune it offline on the AndroidControl dataset. Then, we refine its policy by collecting data from the AndroidWorld environment and performing further training iterations. Our results indicate that AppVLM achieves the highest action prediction accuracy in offline evaluation on the AndroidControl dataset, compared to all evaluated baselines, and matches GPT-4o in online task completion success rate in the AndroidWorld environment, while being up to ten times faster. This makes AppVLM a practical and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

This integration has significantly enhanced performance across a diverse spectrum of applications, such as scene perception and robotics. However, the deployment of VLMs has also given rise to critical safety and security concerns, necessitating extensive research to assess the potential vulnerabilities these VLM systems may harbor. In this work, we present an in-depth survey of the attack strategies tailored for VLMs. We categorize these attacks based on their underlying objectives - namely jailbreak, camouflage, and exploitation - while also detailing the various methodologies employed for data manipulation of VLMs. Meanwhile, we outline corresponding defense mechanisms that have been proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities. By discerning key connections and distinctions among the diverse types of attacks, we propose a compelling taxonomy for VLM attacks. Moreover, we summarize the evaluation metrics that comprehensively describe the characteristics and impact of different attacks on VLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of promising future research directions that could further enhance the robustness and safety of VLMs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing exploration in this critical area of study.

This study investigated simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</p></details> |  |

We model the prediction process using a Structural Causal Model (SCM) and show that the causal mechanism involving both invariant and variant factors in training environments differs from that in test environments. In contrast, the causal mechanism with solely invariant factors remains consistent across environments. We theoretically prove the existence of a linear mapping from CLIP embeddings to invariant factors, which can be estimated using interventional data. Additionally, we provide a condition to guarantee low OOD risk of the invariant predictor. Based on these insights, we propose the Invariant Causal Mechanism of CLIP (CLIP-ICM) framework. CLIP-ICM involves collecting interventional data, estimating a linear projection matrix, and making predictions within the invariant subspace. Experiments on several OOD datasets show that CLIP-ICM significantly improves the performance of CLIP. Our method offers a simple but powerful enhancement, boosting the reliability of CLIP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</p></details> |  |

While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation.

Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in the medical field due to their ability to leverage both visual and linguistic contexts, reducing the need for large datasets and enabling the performance of complex tasks. However, the exploration of fairness within VLM applications remains limited. Applying VLMs without a comprehensive analysis of fairness could lead to concerns about equal treatment opportunities and diminish public trust in medical deep learning models. To build trust in medical VLMs, we propose Fair-MoE, a model specifically designed to ensure both fairness and effectiveness. Fair-MoE comprises two key components: \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Mixture of Experts (FO-MoE)} and \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Loss (FOL)}. FO-MoE is designed to leverage the expertise of various specialists to filter out biased patch embeddings and use an ensemble approach to extract more equitable information relevant to specific tasks. FOL is a novel fairness-oriented loss function that not only minimizes the distances between different attributes but also optimizes the differences in the dispersion of various attributes' distributions. Extended experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and fairness of Fair-MoE. Tested on the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset, Fair-MoE showed improvements in both fairness and accuracy across all four attributes. Code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The conventional modus operandi for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time primarily focuses on tuning learnable prompts; however, this approach overlooks potential distribution shifts in the visual representations themselves. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing Test-Time Noise Tuning (TNT), a novel method for handling unpredictable shifts in the visual space. TNT leverages, for the first time, a noise adaptation strategy that optimizes learnable noise directly in the visual input space, enabling adaptive feature learning from a single test sample. We further introduce a novel approach for inter-view representation alignment by explicitly enforcing coherence in embedding distances, ensuring consistent feature representations across views. Combined with scaled logits and confident view selection at inference, TNT substantially enhances VLM generalization and calibration, achieving average gains of +7.38% on natural distributions benchmark and +0.80% on cross-dataset evaluations over zero-shot CLIP.

Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero</p></details> |

Recently, inspired by Vision-Language Models, Graph Neutral Networks (GNNs) have been introduced as an additional modality into the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance on Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) tasks. However, those GNN-enhanced LLMs have the following limitations: (1) They employ diverse GNNs to model varying types of structured data, rendering them unable to uniformly process various forms of structured data. (2) The pretraining of GNNs is coupled with specific LLMs, which prevents GNNs from fully aligning with the textual space and limits their adaptability to other LLMs. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage and \textbf{S}tructured Data \textbf{A}ssistant (LLaSA), a general framework for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle structured data. Specifically, we represent various types of structured data in a unified hypergraph format, and use self-supervised learning to pretrain a hypergraph encoder, and a G-Former compressing encoded hypergraph representations with cross-attention. The compressed hypergraph representations are appended to the serialized inputs during training and inference stages of LLMs. Experimental results on multiple SKG tasks show that our pretrained hypergraph encoder can adapt to various LLMs and enhance their ability to process different types of structured data. Besides, LLaSA, with LoRA fine-tuning, outperforms previous SOTA method using full parameters tuning.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Main |

However, current retrieval models primarily focus on natural text-image retrieval, making them insufficiently tailored to educational scenarios due to the ambiguities in the retrieval process. In this paper, we propose a diverse expression retrieval task tailored to educational scenarios, supporting retrieval based on multiple query styles and expressions. We introduce the STEM Education Retrieval Dataset (SER), which contains over 24,000 query pairs of different styles, and the Uni-Retrieval, an efficient and style-diversified retrieval vision-language model based on prompt tuning. Uni-Retrieval extracts query style features as prototypes and builds a continuously updated Prompt Bank containing prompt tokens for diverse queries. This bank can updated during test time to represent domain-specific knowledge for different subject retrieval scenarios. Our framework demonstrates scalability and robustness by dynamically retrieving prompt tokens based on prototype similarity, effectively facilitating learning for unknown queries. Experimental results indicate that Uni-Retrieval outperforms existing retrieval models in most retrieval tasks.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding.

Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  |

However, there remains significant room for improvement in aligning visual and language modalities. Existing methods often depend on external models or data, leading to uncontrollable and unstable alignment results. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a self-improvement framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment without external dependencies. SIMA leverages existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses, incorporating an in-context self-critic mechanism that constructs preference pairs for tuning. Crucially, our approach allows LVLMs to act as critics by designing effective critic prompts, eliminating the need for additional fine-tuning with external instruction data. We introduce three novel visual metrics within the self-critic process to guide judgment, significantly improving the accuracy of self-critic. Through extensive experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA significantly improves LVLM's performance and outperforms previous approaches, achieving superior modality alignment.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.

Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</p></details> |  |

Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> |

One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

To address this, we propose an effective yet efficient approach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task and introduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking. Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to new instructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-aware attention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additional supervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistently outperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial age estimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarily focuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a natural and generalized way of learning from visual differences across images, bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.

However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SumGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SumGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Renam...</summary><p>Renamed SGD to SumGD in Summary-Guided Decoding to prevent confusion with Stochastic Gradient Descent</p></details> |

Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have approached this as a perception prediction problem, we formulate it as scene-aware 3D occupancy reconstruction with geometry and semantics. In this work, we propose OccGS, a novel 3D Occupancy reconstruction framework utilizing Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussian Splatting in a zero-shot manner. Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive paradigm, termed UniAff, that integrates 3D object-centric manipulation and task understanding in a unified formulation. Specifically, we constructed a dataset labeled with manipulation-related key attributes, comprising 900 articulated objects from 19 categories and 600 tools from 12 categories. Furthermore, we leverage MLLMs to infer object-centric representations for manipulation tasks, including affordance recognition and reasoning about 3D motion constraints. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings indicate that UniAff significantly improves the generalization of robotic manipulation for tools and articulated objects. We hope that UniAff will serve as a general baseline for unified robotic manipulation tasks in the future.

However, while most VLM research focuses on enhancing multi-modal interaction, the risks of data misuse and leakage have been largely unexplored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario. Our comprehensive evaluations show that these methods can accurately determine membership status, e.g., achieving an AUC greater than 0.8 targeting a small set consisting of only 5 samples on LLaVA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX'25; 22 pages, 28 figures;</p></details> |

Despite considerable advancements in bottom-up and multi-object discovery methods that leverage basic visual cues to identify salient objects, consistently achieving a high recall rate remains difficult due to the diversity of object types and their contextual complexity. In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1\% in AR and achieving a 21.3\% AP improvement over SAM.

To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field.

However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |

To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy.

Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge.

Since modern retrieval systems mainly rely on the textual information they extract from document pages to index documents -often through lengthy and brittle processes-, they struggle to exploit key visual cues efficiently. This limits their capabilities in many practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieval tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and practical settings. The inherent complexity and performance shortcomings of modern systems motivate a new concept; doing document retrieval by directly embedding the images of the document pages. We release ColPali, a Vision Language Model trained to produce high-quality multi-vector embeddings from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically simpler, faster and end-to-end trainable.

Regression models achieve high pose accuracy but struggle with model-to-image alignment due to the lack of explicit 2D-3D correspondences. In contrast, optimization-based methods align 3D models to 2D observations but are prone to local minima and depth ambiguity. In this work, we leverage large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate interactive body part descriptions, which serve as implicit constraints to enhance 3D perception and limit the optimization space. Specifically, we formulate monocular human mesh recovery as a distribution adaptation task by integrating both 2D observations and language descriptions. To bridge the gap between text and 3D pose signals, we first train a text encoder and a pose VQ-VAE, aligning texts to body poses in a shared latent space using contrastive learning. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion-based framework to refine the initial parameters guided by gradients derived from both 2D observations and text descriptions. Finally, the model can produce poses with accurate 3D perception and image consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately identifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in diagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs' visual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source files--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines, annotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we extracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and transformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and generate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of image-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method demonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate answers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram structures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested .xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source files, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the feasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction from original source files.

In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits rankings throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss -- visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation -- semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information -- visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decided still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by abount 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.</p></details> |  |

Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained Vision Language Model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dynvfx.github.io</p></details> |

However, designing visual accessibility systems is challenging due to the complexity of 3D VR environments and the need for techniques that can be easily retrofitted into existing applications. While prior work has studied how to enhance or translate visual information, the advancement of Vision Language Models (VLMs) provides an exciting opportunity to advance the scene interpretation capability of current systems. This paper presents EnVisionVR, an accessibility tool for VR scene interpretation. Through a formative study of usability barriers, we confirmed the lack of visual accessibility features as a key barrier for BLV users of VR content and applications. In response, we designed and developed EnVisionVR, a novel visual accessibility system leveraging a VLM, voice input and multimodal feedback for scene interpretation and virtual object interaction in VR. An evaluation with 12 BLV users demonstrated that EnVisionVR significantly improved their ability to locate virtual objects, effectively supporting scene understanding and object interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The o...</summary><p>The online appendix is available at https://osf.io/zb2ak/</p></details> |

GLOV prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to their fitness for the downstream vision task. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we explicitly guide the LLM's generation at each optimization step by adding an offset vector -- calculated from the embedding differences between previous positive and negative solutions -- to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation. This offset vector biases the LLM generation toward the type of language the downstream VLM prefers, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on two tasks: object recognition and the critical task of enhancing VLM safety. Our GLOV shows performance improvement by up to 15.0% and 57.5% for dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LlaVA) models for object recognition and reduces the attack success rate (ASR) on state-of-the-art VLMs by up to $60.7\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

However, these models are typically trained on web videos, which often fail to capture the challenges present in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. Existing works address ADL-specific challenges, such as similar appearances, subtle motion patterns, and multiple viewpoints, by combining 3D skeletons and RGB videos. However, these approaches are not integrated with language, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen action classes. In this paper, we introduce SKI models, which integrate 3D skeletons into the vision-language embedding space. SKI models leverage a skeleton-language model, SkeletonCLIP, to infuse skeleton information into Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through collaborative training. Notably, SKI models do not require skeleton data during inference, enhancing their robustness for real-world applications. The effectiveness of SKI models is validated on three popular ADL datasets for zero-shot action recognition and video caption generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NAACL: Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> |

While existing vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in specific tasks such as report generation or abnormality detection, they often lack support for interactive diagnostic capabilities. In this work we present RadVLM, a compact, multitask conversational foundation model designed for CXR interpretation. To this end, we curate a large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 1 million image-instruction pairs containing both single-turn tasks -- such as report generation, abnormality classification, and visual grounding -- and multi-turn, multi-task conversational interactions. After fine-tuning RadVLM on this instruction dataset, we evaluate it across different tasks along with re-implemented baseline VLMs. Our results show that RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in conversational capabilities and visual grounding while remaining competitive in other radiology tasks. Ablation studies further highlight the benefit of joint training across multiple tasks, particularly for scenarios with limited annotated data. Together, these findings highlight the potential of RadVLM as a clinically relevant AI assistant, providing structured CXR interpretation and conversational capabilities to support more effective and accessible diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

The primary objective of this challenge is to accurately identify pedestrians exhibiting either normal or abnormal behavior within a large library of pedestrian images. Unlike traditional video analysis tasks, TPAS significantly emphasizes understanding and interpreting the subtle relationships between text descriptions and visual data. The complexity of this task lies in the model's need to not only match individuals to text descriptions in massive image datasets but also accurately differentiate between search results when faced with similar descriptions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Similarity Coverage Analysis (SCA) strategy to address the recognition difficulty caused by similar text descriptions. This strategy effectively enhances the model's capacity to manage subtle differences, thus improving both the accuracy and reliability of the search.

Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. iVISPAR is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle-a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 2D, 3D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while some VLMs perform well on simple spatial tasks, they encounter difficulties with more complex configurations and problem properties. Notably, while VLMs generally perform better in 2D vision compared to 3D or text-based representations, they consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This highlights critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition.</p></details> |  |

However, the safety issues of their integration with a vision module, or vision language models (VLMs), remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreaking attack against VLMs, aiming to bypass their safety barrier when a user inputs harmful instructions. A scenario where our poisoned (image, text) data pairs are included in the training data is assumed. By replacing the original textual captions with malicious jailbreak prompts, our method can perform jailbreak attacks with the poisoned images. Moreover, we analyze the effect of poison ratios and positions of trainable parameters on our attack's success rate. For evaluation, we design two metrics to quantify the success rate and the stealthiness of our attack. Together with a list of curated harmful instructions, a benchmark for measuring attack efficacy is provided. We demonstrate the efficacy of our attack by comparing it with baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Name ...</summary><p>Name change: LlamaFusion to LMFusion</p></details> |

Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.</p></details> |  |

In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.).

By filtering for successful game interactions, we automatically curate a high-quality dataset of interleaved images and text. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on this synthetic data leads to performance gains on downstream tasks and generalises across datasets.

Existing methods heavily depend on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations, we propose Articulate Anymesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate Anymesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets.

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 37.44% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.</p></details> |  |

However, existing UI datasets either only provide large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a much smaller scale. In this work, we propose the \methodname{} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing the UI content changes before and after simulated interactions with specific UI elements. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid and incorrect annotations without human labor. We construct an \methodname{}-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring multi-resolution, multi-device screenshots, diverse data domains, and detailed functionality annotations that have never been provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that the AutoGUI pipeline achieves annotation correctness comparable to trained human annotators. Extensive experimental results show that our \methodname{}-704k dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities, exhibits significant scaling effects, and outperforms existing web pre-training data types. We envision AutoGUI as a scalable pipeline for generating massive data to build GUI-oriented VLMs. AutoGUI dataset can be viewed at this anonymous URL: https://autogui-project.github.io/.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Current end-to-end driving models struggle with generalization to these rare events due to limitations in traditional detection and prediction approaches. To address this, we propose INSIGHT (Integration of Semantic and Visual Inputs for Generalized Hazard Tracking), a hierarchical vision-language model (VLM) framework designed to enhance hazard detection and edge-case evaluation. By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Attention Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01969v1)** | 2025-02-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.01969v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain highly susceptible to object hallucination, where models generate responses that are not factually aligned with the visual content. Recent works attribute this issue to an inherent bias of LVLMs where vision token attention map has a fixed correlation with spatial position, and propose to mitigate this issue by reordering visual tokens. However, we find that different LVLMs exhibit different correlations between attention and spatial position, which makes the existing solution difficult to generalize to other LVLMs. To address this issue, we first introduce a training-free solution, Uniform Attention Calibration (UAC), that estimates the bias from single meaningless input image and applies a calibration matrix to rectify attention imbalances. To further alleviate the bias, we relax the assumption of single meaningless input in UAC and introduce a fine-tuning solution, Dynamic Attention Calibration (DAC), that enforces the consistent outputs wherever the object locates in the image via a plug-and-plays module. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UAC and DAC significantly reduce object hallucination while improving general multimodal alignment. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse LVLM architectures on various metrics.</p></details> |  |

Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.</p></details> |  |

Aquatic scene understanding plays a pivotal role in aiding marine scientists in their decision-making processes. In this paper, we introduce AquaticCLIP, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training model tailored for aquatic scene understanding. AquaticCLIP presents a new unsupervised learning framework that aligns images and texts in aquatic environments, enabling tasks such as segmentation, classification, detection, and object counting. By leveraging our large-scale underwater image-text paired dataset without the need for ground-truth annotations, our model enriches existing vision-language models in the aquatic domain. For this purpose, we construct a 2 million underwater image-text paired dataset using heterogeneous resources, including YouTube, Netflix, NatGeo, etc. To fine-tune AquaticCLIP, we propose a prompt-guided vision encoder that progressively aggregates patch features via learnable prompts, while a vision-guided mechanism enhances the language encoder by incorporating visual context. The model is optimized through a contrastive pretraining loss to align visual and textual modalities. AquaticCLIP achieves notable performance improvements in zero-shot settings across multiple underwater computer vision tasks, outperforming existing methods in both robustness and interpretability. Our model sets a new benchmark for vision-language applications in underwater environments. The code and dataset for AquaticCLIP are publicly available on GitHub at xxx.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce PrefVLM, a framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with selective human feedback to significantly reduce annotation requirements while maintaining performance. Our method leverages VLMs to generate initial preference labels, which are then filtered to identify uncertain cases for targeted human annotation. Additionally, we adapt VLMs using a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss to improve alignment with evolving policies. Experiments on Meta-World manipulation tasks demonstrate that PrefVLM achieves comparable or superior success rates to state-of-the-art methods while using up to 2 x fewer human annotations. Furthermore, we show that adapted VLMs enable efficient knowledge transfer across tasks, further minimizing feedback needs. Our results highlight the potential of combining VLMs with selective human supervision to make preference-based RL more scalable and practical.</p></details> |  |

A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning.

These biases have often been studied in cognitive science using concepts or categories -- e.g. by testing how humans generalize a new category from a few examples that leave the category boundary ambiguous. We use these approaches to study generalization in foundation models during in-context learning. Modern foundation models can condition on both vision and text, and differences in how they interpret and learn from these different modalities is an emerging area of study. Here, we study how their generalizations vary by the modality in which stimuli are presented, and the way the stimuli are described in text. We study these biases with three different experimental paradigms, across three different vision-language models. We find that the models generally show some bias towards generalizing according to shape over color. This shape bias tends to be amplified when the examples are presented visually. By contrast, when examples are presented in text, the ordering of adjectives affects generalization. However, the extent of these effects vary across models and paradigms. These results help to reveal how vision-language models represent different types of inputs in context, and may have practical implications for the use of vision-language models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, conventional benchmarks have reached performance saturation, making it difficult to compare recent OOD detection methods. To address this challenge, we introduce three novel OOD detection benchmarks that enable a deeper understanding of method characteristics and reflect real-world conditions. First, we present ImageNet-X, designed to evaluate performance under challenging semantic shifts. Second, we propose ImageNet-FS-X for full-spectrum OOD detection, assessing robustness to covariate shifts (feature distribution shifts). Finally, we propose Wilds-FS-X, which extends these evaluations to real-world datasets, offering a more comprehensive testbed. Our experiments reveal that recent CLIP-based OOD detection methods struggle to varying degrees across the three proposed benchmarks, and none of them consistently outperforms the others. We hope the community goes beyond specific benchmarks and includes more challenging conditions reflecting real-world scenarios.

GIFT starts from local faithful visual counterfactual explanations and employs (vision) language models to translate those into global textual explanations. Crucially, GIFT provides a verification stage measuring the causal effect of the proposed explanations on the classifier decision. Through experiments across diverse datasets, including CLEVR, CelebA, and BDD, we demonstrate that GIFT effectively reveals meaningful insights, uncovering tasks, concepts, and biases used by deep vision classifiers.

The performance of such models hinges on having a good connector that maps visual features generated by a vision encoder to a shared embedding space with the LLM while preserving semantic similarity. Existing connectors, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), often produce out-of-distribution or noisy inputs, leading to misalignment between the modalities. In this work, we propose a novel vision-text alignment method, AlignVLM, that maps visual features to a weighted average of LLM text embeddings. Our approach leverages the linguistic priors encoded by the LLM to ensure that visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can effectively interpret. AlignVLM is particularly effective for document understanding tasks, where scanned document images must be accurately mapped to their textual content. Our extensive experiments show that AlignVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to prior alignment methods. We provide further analysis demonstrating improved vision-text feature alignment and robustness to noise.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a multi-modal agent tuning method that automatically generates multi-modal tool-usage data and tunes a vision-language model (VLM) as the controller for powerful tool-usage reasoning. To preserve the data quality, we prompt the GPT-4o mini model to generate queries, files, and trajectories, followed by query-file and trajectory verifiers. Based on the data synthesis pipeline, we collect the MM-Traj dataset that contains 20K tasks with trajectories of tool usage. Then, we develop the T3-Agent via \underline{T}rajectory \underline{T}uning on VLMs for \underline{T}ool usage using MM-Traj. Evaluations on the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the T3-Agent consistently achieves improvements on two popular VLMs: MiniCPM-V-8.5B and {Qwen2-VL-7B}, which outperforms untrained VLMs by $20\%$, showing the effectiveness of the proposed data synthesis pipeline, leading to high-quality data for tool-usage capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, https://mat-agent.github.io/</p></details> |

Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prior...</summary><p>Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</p></details> |

Addressing this, we introduce a method to generate distributions of camera poses conditioned on textual descriptions, facilitating robust reasoning for broadly defined concepts. Our approach employs a diffusion-based architecture to refine noisy 6DoF camera poses towards plausible locations, with conditional signals derived from pre-trained text encoders. Integration with the pretrained Vision-Language Model, CLIP, establishes a strong linkage between text descriptions and pose distributions. Enhancement of localization accuracy is achieved by rendering candidate poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, which corrects misaligned samples through visual reasoning. We validate our method's superiority by comparing it against standard distribution estimation methods across five large-scale datasets, demonstrating consistent outperformance.

However, annotating RS images with rich linguistic semantics at scale demands expertise in RS and substantial human labor, making it costly and often impractical. In this study, we propose a workflow that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate multimodal datasets with semantically rich captions at scale from plain OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for images sourced from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This approach facilitates the generation of paired remote sensing data and can be readily scaled up using openly available data. Within this framework, we present RSTeller, a multimodal dataset comprising over 1.3 million RS images, each accompanied by two descriptive captions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTeller enhances the performance of multiple existing vision language models for RS scene understanding through continual pre-training. Our methodology significantly reduces the manual effort and expertise needed for annotating remote sensing imagery while democratizing access to high-quality annotated data. This advancement fosters progress in visual language modeling and encourages broader participation in remote sensing research and applications.

Recent AD methods have evolved with the advent of large pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing few-shot anomaly detection capabilities. However, these latest AD methods still exhibit limitations in accuracy improvement. One contributing factor is their direct comparison of a query image's features with those of few-shot normal images. This direct comparison often leads to a loss of precision and complicates the extension of these techniques to more complex domains--an area that remains underexplored in a more refined and comprehensive manner. To address these limitations, we introduce the anomaly personalization method, which performs a personalized one-to-normal transformation of query images using an anomaly-free customized generation model, ensuring close alignment with the normal manifold. Moreover, to further enhance the stability and robustness of prediction results, we propose a triplet contrastive anomaly inference strategy, which incorporates a comprehensive comparison between the query and generated anomaly-free data pool and prompt information. Extensive evaluations across eleven datasets in three domains demonstrate our model's effectiveness compared to the latest AD methods.

Here we investigate this gap for challenging images where objects are seen in unusual poses. We find that humans excel at recognizing objects in such poses. In contrast, state-of-the-art deep networks for vision (EfficientNet, SWAG, ViT, SWIN, BEiT, ConvNext) and state-of-the-art large vision-language models (Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, GPT-4) are systematically brittle on unusual poses, with the exception of Gemini showing excellent robustness in that condition. As we limit image exposure time, human performance degrades to the level of deep networks, suggesting that additional mental processes (requiring additional time) are necessary to identify objects in unusual poses. An analysis of error patterns of humans vs. networks reveals that even time-limited humans are dissimilar to feed-forward deep networks. In conclusion, our comparison reveals that humans and deep networks rely on different mechanisms for recognizing objects in unusual poses.

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Fourier Neural Operator Networks: A Fast and General Solver for the Photoacoustic Wave Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09374v1)** | 2021-08-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2108.09374v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation tools for photoacoustic wave propagation have played a key role in advancing photoacoustic imaging by providing quantitative and qualitative insights into parameters affecting image quality. Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2007.14747v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
