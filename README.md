| **[What is the relation between Slow Feature Analysis and the Successor Representation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16991v2)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.16991v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slow feature analysis (SFA) is an unsupervised method for extracting representations from time series data. The successor representation (SR) is a method for representing states in a Markov decision process (MDP) based on transition statistics. While SFA and SR stem from distinct areas of machine learning, they share important properties, both in terms of their mathematics and the types of information they are sensitive to. This work studies their connection along these two axes. In particular, both SFA and SR are explored analytically, and in the setting of a one-hot encoded MDP, a formal equivalence is demonstrated in terms of the grid-like representations that occur as solutions/eigenvectors. Moreover, it is shown that the columns of the matrices involved in SFA contain place-like representations, which are formally distinct from place-cell models that have already been defined using SFA.</p></details> | 52 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08904v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.12550</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v3)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.05440v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series does not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different models. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand trivial time series anomalies, we have no evidence that they can understand more subtle real-world anomalies. Many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. All synthetic dataset generators, final prompts, and evaluation scripts have been made available in https://github.com/rose-stl-lab/anomllm.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02800v3)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.02800v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges, particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[PCA-Featured Transformer for Jamming Detection in 5G UAV Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15312v2)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.15312v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) face significant security risks from jamming attacks, which can compromise network functionality. Traditional detection methods often fall short when confronting AI-powered jamming that dynamically modifies its behavior, while contemporary machine learning approaches frequently demand substantial feature engineering and struggle with temporal patterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks employing Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where service quality may deteriorate due to deliberate interference. We introduce a novel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless security. The training process is regularized by incorporating the output entropy uncertainty into the loss function, a mechanism inspired by the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robust jamming detection techniques. The architecture features a modified transformer encoder specially designed to process critical wireless signal features, including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) measurements. We complement this with a custom positional encoding mechanism that specifically accounts for the inherent periodicity of wireless signals,enabling a more accurate representation of temporal signal patterns. In addition, we propose a batch size scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize convergence for time series data. These advancements contribute to up to a ten times improvement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder transformer model introduced in this study. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our entropy-based approach, achieving detection rates of 85.06% in NLoS scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888v2)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.16888v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | revised |
| **[Data Driven Decision Making with Time Series and Spatio-temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08473v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08473v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data captures properties that change over time. Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Ev-Layout: A Large-scale Event-based Multi-modal Dataset for Indoor Layout Estimation and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08370v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08370v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Ev-Layout, a novel large-scale event-based multi-modal dataset designed for indoor layout estimation and tracking. Ev-Layout makes key contributions to the community by: Utilizing a hybrid data collection platform (with a head-mounted display and VR interface) that integrates both RGB and bio-inspired event cameras to capture indoor layouts in motion. Incorporating time-series data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ambient lighting conditions recorded during data collection to highlight the potential impact of motion speed and lighting on layout estimation accuracy. The dataset consists of 2.5K sequences, including over 771.3K RGB images and 10 billion event data points. Of these, 39K images are annotated with indoor layouts, enabling research in both event-based and video-based indoor layout estimation. Based on the dataset, we propose an event-based layout estimation pipeline with a novel event-temporal distribution feature module to effectively aggregate the spatio-temporal information from events. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal feature fusion module that can be easily integrated into a transformer module for fusion purposes. Finally, we conduct benchmarking and extensive experiments on the Ev-Layout dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of dynamic indoor layout estimation compared to existing event-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFRS: A Multi-Frequency Reference Series Approach to Scalable and Accurate Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08328v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08328v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series forecasting holds immense value across diverse applications, requiring methods to effectively capture complex temporal and inter-variable dynamics. A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic patterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on network architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies. Inspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series predictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different frequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method based on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through spectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral components and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series. Unlike signal decomposition, which represents the original series as a linear combination of basis signals, our method uses a transformer model to compute cross-attention between the original series and reference series, capturing essential features for forecasting. Experiments on major open and synthetic datasets show state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by focusing on attention with a small number of reference series rather than pairwise variable attention, our method ensures scalability and broad applicability.

| **[LangTime: A Language-Guided Unified Model for Time Series Forecasting with Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08271v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08271v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown an increasing interest in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for a variety of time series applications. However, there are three main challenges when using LLMs as foundational models for time series forecasting: (1) Cross-domain generalization. (2) Cross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks. To address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified model for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training with reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime constructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise and channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense time series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align temporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error accumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for time series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting performance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and accuracy of autoregressive forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Head: Helping Large Language Models Learn Complex Probability Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22269v2)** | 2025-03-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.22269v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the quality of large language models has improved, there has been increased interest in using them to model non-linguistic tokens. For example, the Decision Transformer recasts agentic decision making as a sequence modeling problem, using a decoder-only LLM to model the distribution over the discrete action space for an Atari agent. However, when adapting LLMs to non-linguistic domains, it remains unclear if softmax over discrete bins captures the continuous structure of the tokens and the potentially complex distributions needed for high quality token generation. We introduce a neural network layer, constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency noise. All of our results support the effectiveness of our proposed Fourier head in scenarios where the underlying data distribution has a natural continuous structure. For example, the Fourier head improves a Decision Transformer agent's returns across four benchmark Atari games by as much as 377%, and increases a state-of-the-art times series foundation model's forecasting performance by 3.5% across 20 benchmarks unseen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version (ICLR 2025).

This challenge is further compounded by adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for resilient methods that ensure robust performance and efficient model selection. We introduce ReLATE, a framework that identifies robust learners based on dataset similarity, reduces computational overhead, and enhances resilience. ReLATE maintains multiple deep learning models in well-known adversarial attack scenarios, capturing model performance. ReLATE identifies the most analogous dataset to a given target using a similarity metric, then applies the optimal model from the most similar dataset. ReLATE reduces computational overhead by an average of 81.2%, enhancing adversarial resilience and streamlining robust model selection, all without sacrificing performance, within 4.2% of Oracle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS)</p></details> |

However, the progress of countries towards these goal has been slower than expected and, consequently, there is a need to investigate the reasons behind this fact. In this study, we have used a novel data-driven methodology to analyze time-series data for over 20 years (2000-2022) from 107 countries using unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques. Our analysis reveals strong positive and negative correlations between certain SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). Our findings show that progress toward the SDGs is heavily influenced by geographical, cultural and socioeconomic factors, with no country on track to achieve all the goals by 2030. This highlights the need for a region-specific, systemic approach to sustainable development that acknowledges the complex interdependencies between the goals and the variable capacities of countries to reach them. For this our machine learning based approach provides a robust framework for developing efficient and data-informed strategies to promote cooperative and targeted initiatives for sustainable progress.</p></details> |  |

Time series clustering is important for identifying patterns in these datasets. However, prevailing methods often encounter obstacles in maintaining data relationships and ensuring interpretability. We present Graphint, an innovative system based on the $k$-Graph methodology that addresses these challenges. Graphint integrates a robust time series clustering algorithm with an interactive tool for comparison and interpretation. More precisely, our system allows users to compare results against competing approaches, identify discriminative subsequences within specified datasets, and visualize the critical information utilized by $k$-Graph to generate outputs. Overall, Graphint offers a comprehensive solution for extracting actionable insights from complex temporal datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Constraint-Preserving Neural Network Approach for Solving Mean-Field Games Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17450v2)** | 2025-03-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.17450v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based methods have demonstrated effectiveness in solving high-dimensional Mean-Field Games (MFG) equilibria, yet ensuring mathematically consistent density-coupled evolution remains a major challenge. This paper proposes the NF-MKV Net, a neural network approach that integrates process-regularized normalizing flow (NF) with state-policy-connected time-series neural networks to solve MKV FBSDEs and their associated fixed-point formulations of MFG equilibria. The method first reformulates MFG equilibria as MKV FBSDEs, embedding density evolution into equation coefficients within a probabilistic framework. Neural networks are then employed to approximate value functions and their gradients. To enforce volumetric invariance and temporal continuity, NF architectures impose loss constraints on each density transfer function.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Personalized Convolutional Dictionary Learning of Physiological Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07687v1)** | 2025-03-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07687v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human physiological signals tend to exhibit both global and local structures: the former are shared across a population, while the latter reflect inter-individual variability. For instance, kinetic measurements of the gait cycle during locomotion present common characteristics, although idiosyncrasies may be observed due to biomechanical disposition or pathology. To better represent datasets with local-global structure, this work extends Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL), a popular method for learning interpretable representations, or dictionaries, of time-series data. In particular, we propose Personalized CDL (PerCDL), in which a local dictionary models local information as a personalized spatiotemporal transformation of a global dictionary. The transformation is learnable and can combine operations such as time warping and rotation. Formal computational and statistical guarantees for PerCDL are provided and its effectiveness on synthetic and real human locomotion data is demonstrated.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07259v1)** | 2025-03-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07259v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at https://github.com/Breezelled/COMODO .</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series Multitask Framework Integrating a Large Language Model, Pre-Trained Time Series Model, and Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07682v1)** | 2025-03-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.07682v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, transportation, and industry. However, traditional models often focus solely on temporal features, limiting their ability to capture underlying information. This paper proposes a novel time series multitask framework, called LTM, which integrates temporal features with textual descriptions to enhance analytical and predictive capabilities. LTM combines pre-trained time series model, large language model (LLM), and knowledge graph to tackle time series tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. LTM achieves improved performance with a few trainable parameters. It is very efficient and practical. LTM encodes time series data into patches and enriches user-provided prompts using knowledge graphs to generate enhanced prompts. A novel feature fusion method embeds prompts into each patch encoding, which is processed by a frozen LLM, followed by a feature enhancement module and a time decoder module. During fine-tuning stage, cosine similarity between prompts and temporal patches is integrated into the loss function to boost performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that LTM significantly outperforms existing methods. It provides a robust and versatile solution for time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

While pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown promise in CIL for vision and NLP domains, their potential in time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) remains underexplored due to the scarcity of large-scale time series pre-trained models. Prompted by the recent emergence of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) for time series data, we present the first exploration of PTM-based Time Series Class-Incremental Learning (TSCIL). Our approach leverages frozen PTM backbones coupled with incrementally tuning the shared adapter, preserving generalization capabilities while mitigating feature drift through knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Drift Compensation Network (DCN), designed with a novel two-stage training strategy to precisely model feature space transformations across incremental tasks. This allows for accurate projection of old class prototypes into the new feature space. By employing DCN-corrected prototypes, we effectively enhance the unified classifier retraining, mitigating model feature drift and alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our method yielding final accuracy gains of 1.4%-6.1% across all datasets compared to existing PTM-based approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for TSCIL, providing insights into stability-plasticity optimization for continual learning systems.</p></details> | 13 pages,6 figures |

This paper introduces a real-world, multivariate time series dataset collected exclusively from a single anonymized engine component (Component X) across a fleet of SCANIA trucks. The dataset includes operational data, repair records, and specifications related to Component X, while maintaining confidentiality through anonymization.

To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems.

Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Conversely, the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis has fallen short of expectations, diminishing their potential for future applications. Our research aims to enhance the representational capacity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in time series analysis by introducing novel perspectives and design innovations. To be specific, We introduce a novel time series reshaping technique that considers the inter-patch, intra-patch, and cross-variable dimensions. Consequently, we propose TVNet, a dynamic convolutional network leveraging a 3D perspective to employ time series analysis. TVNet retains the computational efficiency of CNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results in five key time series analysis tasks, offering a superior balance of efficiency and performance over the state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Additionally, our findings suggest that TVNet exhibits enhanced transferability and robustness.

Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.</p></details> |  |

A straightforward solution is to adapt to nonstationary changes while preserving stationary dependencies. Hence, some methods disentangle stationary and nonstationary components by assuming uniform distribution shifts, but it is impractical since when the distribution changes is unknown. To address this challenge, we propose the \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{UDA}) model for nonstationary time series forecasting, which detects when distribution shifts occur and disentangles stationary/nonstationary latent variables, thus enabling adaptation to unknown distribution without assuming a uniform distribution shift. Specifically, under a Hidden Markov assumption of latent environments, we demonstrate that the latent environments are identifiable. Sequentially, we further disentangle stationary/nonstationary latent variables by leveraging the variability of historical information. Based on these theoretical results, we propose a variational autoencoder-based model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments. Additionally, we further devise the modular prior networks to disentangle stationary/nonstationary latent variables. These two modules realize automatic adaptation and enhance nonstationary forecasting performance. Experimental results on several datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p></details> |  |

However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.</p></details> | 10pages |

Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively.

PVA can result in clinical complications such as discomfort, sleep disruption, and potentially more severe conditions like ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm dysfunction. Traditional PVA management, which relies on manual adjustments by healthcare providers, is often inadequate due to delays and errors. While various computational methods, including rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to detect PVA events, they face challenges related to dataset imbalances and lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a shapelet-based approach SHIP for PVA detection, utilizing shapelets - discriminative subsequences in time-series data - to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. Our method addresses dataset imbalances through shapelet-based data augmentation and constructs a shapelet pool to transform the dataset for more effective classification. The combined shapelet and statistical features are then used in a classifier to identify PVA events. Experimental results on medical datasets show that SHIP significantly improves PVA detection while providing interpretable insights into model decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PAKDD 2025</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based approaches typically suffer from three critical limitations: Inefficient parameter utilization in handling numerical time series patterns; Modality misalignment between continuous temporal signals and discrete text embeddings; and Inflexibility for real-time expert knowledge integration. We present SMETimes, the first systematic investigation of sub-3B parameter SLMs for efficient and accurate time series forecasting. Our approach centers on three key innovations: A statistically-enhanced prompting mechanism that bridges numerical time series with textual semantics through descriptive statistical features; A adaptive fusion embedding architecture that aligns temporal patterns with language model token spaces through learnable parameters; And a dynamic mixture-of-experts framework enabled by SLMs' computational efficiency, adaptively combining base predictions with domain-specific models. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 3B-parameter SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five primary datasets while maintaining 3.8x faster training and 5.2x lower memory consumption compared to 7B-parameter LLM baselines. Notably, the proposed model exhibits better learning capabilities, achieving 12.3% lower MSE than conventional LLM. Ablation studies validate that our statistical prompting and cross-modal fusion modules respectively contribute 15.7% and 18.2% error reduction in long-horizon forecasting tasks. By redefining the efficiency-accuracy trade-off landscape, this work establishes SLMs as viable alternatives to resource-intensive LLMs for practical time series forecasting.

This study addresses this gap by creating and making publicly available a set of NetFlow datasets that incorporate these temporal features [1]. With these temporal features, we provide a comprehensive temporal analysis of NetFlow datasets by examining the distribution of various features over time and presenting time-series representations of NetFlow features. This temporal analysis has not been previously provided in the existing literature. We also borrowed an idea from signal processing, time frequency analysis, and tested it to see how different the time frequency signal presentations (TFSPs) are for various attacks. The results indicate that many attacks have unique patterns, which could help ML models to identify them more easily.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression.

Evaluated on the Mackey-Glass, Lorenz, and R\"ossler chaotic time series, as well as a real-world financial dataset from ACI Worldwide Inc., our results demonstrate that the Diff- LSTM network outperforms prevalent models such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional and encoder-decoder LSTM networks in both short-term and long-term predictions.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies.

These datasets often include auxiliary conditions that influence the values within the time series signal. Existing methods face three key challenges: (1) they fail to adapt to conditions at inference time; (2) they rely on sequential generation, which slows the generation speed; and (3) they inefficiently encode categorical features, leading to increased sparsity and input sizes. We propose WaveStitch, a novel method that addresses these challenges by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models to efficiently generate accurate temporal data under given auxiliary constraints. WaveStitch overcomes these limitations by: (1) modeling interactions between constraints and signals to generalize to new, unseen conditions; (2) enabling the parallel synthesis of sequential segments with a novel "stitching" mechanism to enforce coherence across segments; and (3) encoding categorical features as compact periodic signals while preserving temporal patterns. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets highlight WaveStitch's ability to generalize to unseen conditions during inference, achieving up to a 10x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, WaveStitch generates data up to 460x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. By efficiently encoding categorical features, WaveStitch provides a robust and efficient solution for temporal data generation.

The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods to DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems and has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms -- caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships -- by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library.

To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</p></details> |  |

Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

However, forecasting contraceptive demand in developing countries presents challenges, including incomplete data, poor data quality, and the need to account for multiple geographical and product factors. Current methods often rely on simple forecasting techniques, which fail to capture demand uncertainties arising from these factors, warranting expert involvement. Our study aims to improve contraceptive demand forecasting by combining probabilistic forecasting methods with expert knowledge. We developed a hybrid model that combines point forecasts from domain-specific model with probabilistic distributions from statistical and machine learning approaches, enabling human input to fine-tune and enhance the system-generated forecasts. This approach helps address the uncertainties in demand and is particularly useful in resource-limited settings. We evaluate different forecasting methods, including time series, Bayesian, machine learning, and foundational time series methods alongside our new hybrid approach. By comparing these methods, we provide insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and computational requirements. Our research fills a gap in forecasting contraceptive demand and offers a practical framework that combines algorithmic and human expertise. Our proposed model can also be generalized to other humanitarian contexts with similar data patterns.</p></details> |  |

To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</p></details> |  |

Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function.

Each model in the dictionary is identified via cross-validation using tailored learning data. It is also shown that the proposed approach provides heuristically defined confidence intervals on the resulting estimation. The performance of the framework is compared to the state-of-the-art available algorithms showing noticeably higher accuracy.

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different tasks, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Under review |

The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to GIScience & Remote Sensing</p></details> |

However, conventional neuron models like the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) struggle to capture long-term dependencies and effectively process multi-scale temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

The reasons are twofold. First, labels for multi-modal time series data are coarse and devoid of analysis or reasoning processes. Training with these data cannot improve the model's reasoning capabilities. Second, due to the lack of precise tokenization in processing time series, the representation patterns for temporal and textual information are inconsistent, which hampers the effectiveness of multi-modal alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal time series data construction approach and a multi-modal time series language model (TLM), TempoGPT. Specially, we construct multi-modal data for complex reasoning tasks by analyzing the variable-system relationships within a white-box system. Additionally, proposed TempoGPT achieves consistent representation between temporal and textual information by quantizing temporal embeddings, where temporal embeddings are quantized into a series of discrete tokens using a predefined codebook; subsequently, a shared embedding layer processes both temporal and textual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoGPT accurately perceives temporal information, logically infers conclusions, and achieves state-of-the-art in the constructed complex time series reasoning tasks. Moreover, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of quantizing temporal embeddings in enhancing multi-modal alignment and the reasoning capabilities of TLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhanghaochuan20/TempoGPT.</p></details> |  |

The intricacy of time series data poses significant challenges for modeling. Models based on the Transformer architecture, through the application of attention mechanisms to channels and sequences, have demonstrated notable performance advantages. In contrast, methods based on convolutional neural networks or linear models often struggle to effectively handle scenarios with large number of channels. However, our research reveals that the attention mechanism is not the core component responsible for performance enhancement. We have designed an exceedingly simple linear structure AverageLinear. By employing straightforward channel embedding and averaging operations, this model can effectively capture correlations between channels while maintaining a lightweight architecture. Experimentss on real-world datasets shows that AverageLinear matches or even surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer-based structures in performance. This indicates that using purely linear structures can also endow models with robust predictive power.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, we propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called ForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network architecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the time series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of occurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this, we introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and Boltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to iteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted time points for each inputted time series to the network through successive forward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned representation of the observed realizations of the time series for its classification decision. Boltzmann convolutional layers are linear combinations of approximately Bayesian convolutional layers with different filter lengths, allowing the model to learn multitemporal resolution representations of the input time series, and which resolutions to focus on within a given Boltzmann convolutional layer through a Boltzmann distribution. Through several simulation scenarios and two real world applications we demonstrate ForeClassNet achieves superior performance compared with current state of the art methods including a near 30% improvement in test set accuracy in our financial example compared to the second best performing model.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

While these XAI techniques can extract meaningful insights from deep learning models, how to properly evaluate them remains an open problem. The most widely used approach is to perturb or even remove what the XAI method considers to be the most important features in an input and observe the changes in the output prediction. This approach, although straightforward, suffers the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem as the perturbed samples may no longer follow the original data distribution. A recent method RemOve And Retrain (ROAR) solves the OOD issue by retraining the model with perturbed samples guided by explanations. However, using the model retrained based on XAI methods to evaluate these explainers may cause information leakage and thus lead to unfair comparisons. We propose Fine-tuned Fidelity (F-Fidelity), a robust evaluation framework for XAI, which utilizes i) an explanation-agnostic fine-tuning strategy, thus mitigating the information leakage issue, and ii) a random masking operation that ensures that the removal step does not generate an OOD input. We also design controlled experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) explainers and their degraded version to verify the correctness of our framework. We conduct experiments on multiple data modalities, such as images, time series, and natural language. The results demonstrate that F-Fidelity significantly improves upon prior evaluation metrics in recovering the ground-truth ranking of the explainers. Furthermore, we show both theoretically and empirically that, given a faithful explainer, F-Fidelity metric can be used to compute the sparsity of influential input components, i.e., to extract the true explanation size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025); 33 Pages, 5 figures, 26 Tables</p></details> |

High-fidelity computational models are often employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and prioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively expensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct dynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the plume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is often modeled by the Gaussian plume model. We address the challenge of modeling the initial plume generation. Specifically, we propose a data-driven framework that identifies a reduced-order analytical model for plume dynamics -- directly from video data. We extract a time series of plume center and edge points from video snapshots and evaluate different regressions based to their extrapolation performance to generate a time series of coefficients that characterize the plume's overall direction and spread. We regress to a sinusoidal model inspired by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the edge points in order to identify the plume's dispersion and vorticity. Overall, this reduced-order modeling framework provides a data-driven and lightweight approach to capture the dominant features of the initial nonlinear point-source plume dynamics, agnostic to plume type and starting only from video. The resulting model is a pre-cursor to standard models such as the Gaussian plume model and has the potential to enable rapid assessment and evaluation of critical environmental hazards, such as methane leaks, chemical spills, and pollutant dispersal from smokestacks.</p></details> |  |

However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |

In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models. This ensures that only the most effective updates are adopted, improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context.

However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</p></details> |  |

We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels.

Nonlinear dimension techniques, particularly autoencoders, have emerged as promising alternatives in a FAVAR framework, but challenges remain in identifiability, interpretability, and integration with traditional nonlinear time series methods. We address these challenges through two contributions. First, we introduce a Grouped Sparse autoencoder that employs the Spike-and-Slab Lasso prior, with parameters under this prior being shared across variables of the same economic category, thereby achieving semi-identifiability and enhancing model interpretability. Second, we incorporate time-varying parameters into the VAR component to better capture evolving economic dynamics. Our empirical application to the US economy demonstrates that the Grouped Sparse autoencoder produces more interpretable factors through its parsimonious structure; and its combination with time-varying parameter VAR shows superior performance in both point and density forecasting. Impulse response analysis reveals that monetary policy shocks during recessions generate more moderate responses with higher uncertainty compared to expansionary periods.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically reviews the channel modeling strategies for time series and proposes a taxonomy organized into three hierarchical levels: the strategy perspective, the mechanism perspective, and the characteristic perspective. On this basis, we provide a structured analysis of these methods and conduct an in-depth examination of the advantages and limitations of different channel strategies.

Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations. Our findings underscore the critical need for an increased focus on implicit misinformation in LLM safety research.</p></details> |  |

Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |

Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Using constructed languages generated by cryptographic means as controlled test environments, we designed experiments to assess an LLM's ability to explicitly learn and apply grammar rules. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs possess a measurable capacity for explicit learning, this ability diminishes as the complexity of the linguistic phenomena at hand increases. Supervised fine-tuning on chains of thought significantly enhances LLM performance but struggles to generalize to typologically novel or more complex linguistic features. These findings point to the need for more diverse training sets and alternative fine-tuning strategies to further improve explicit learning by LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and recently Large Language Models are widely used to detect security flaws. This paper introduces CASTLE (CWE Automated Security Testing and Low-Level Evaluation), a benchmarking framework for evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of different methods. We assess 13 static analysis tools, 10 LLMs, and 2 formal verification tools using a hand-crafted dataset of 250 micro-benchmark programs covering 25 common CWEs. We propose the CASTLE Score, a novel evaluation metric to ensure fair comparison. Our results reveal key differences: ESBMC (a formal verification tool) minimizes false positives but struggles with vulnerabilities beyond model checking, such as weak cryptography or SQL injection. Static analyzers suffer from high false positives, increasing manual validation efforts for developers. LLMs perform exceptionally well in the CASTLE dataset when identifying vulnerabilities in small code snippets. However, their accuracy declines, and hallucinations increase as the code size grows. These results suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in future security solutions, particularly within code completion frameworks, where they can provide real-time guidance to prevent vulnerabilities.

These methods have found success in the field, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated outside of high-resource languages. In this work, we discuss our experiences in post-training an LLM for instruction-following for English and Finnish. We use a multilingual LLM to translate instruction and preference datasets from English to Finnish. We perform instruction tuning and preference optimization in English and Finnish and evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of the model in both languages. Our results show that with a few hundred Finnish instruction samples we can obtain competitive performance in Finnish instruction-following. We also found that although preference optimization in English offers some cross-lingual benefits, we obtain our best results by using preference data from both languages.

We hypothesize that reiterating a question within a single prompt might enhance the model's focus on key elements of the query. We evaluate five recent LLMs -- including GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and smaller open-source models -- on three reading comprehension datasets under different prompt settings, varying question repetition levels (1, 3, or 5 times per prompt). Our results demonstrate that question repetition can increase models' accuracy by up to $6\%$. However, across all models, settings, and datasets, we do not find the result statistically significant. These findings provide insights into prompt design and LLM behavior, suggesting that repetition alone does not significantly impact output quality.</p></details> |  |

Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git.</p></details> |  |

The lack of unified standards, including format, terminology, and style, is a great challenge in clinical fundus diagnostic reports, which increases the difficulty for large language models (LLMs) to understand the data. To address this, we construct a bilingual standard terminology, containing fundus clinical terms and commonly used descriptions in clinical diagnosis. Then, we establish two models, RetSTA-7B-Zero and RetSTA-7B. RetSTA-7B-Zero, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset simulating clinical scenarios, demonstrates powerful standardization behaviors. However, it encounters a challenge of limitation to cover a wider range of diseases. To further enhance standardization performance, we build RetSTA-7B, which integrates a substantial amount of standardized data generated by RetSTA-7B-Zero along with corresponding English data, covering diverse complex clinical scenarios and achieving report-level standardization for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate that RetSTA-7B outperforms other compared LLMs in bilingual standardization task, which validates its superior performance and generalizability.

To investigate this counterintuitive phenomenon, we examine how LLMs reason when making trading decisions. Our findings reveal that (1) stronger LLMs show a preference for factual information over subjectivity; (2) separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components leads to higher profits. Building on these insights, we propose a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this fine-grained reasoning approach enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets, yielding profit improvements of 7\% in BTC, 2\% in ETH, and 10\% in SOL. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news generates higher returns in bull markets, while focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets.

LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09347v1)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.09347v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.</p></details> | 8 pages, preprint |

To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is submitted to "The 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval" and is currently under review</p></details> |

Traditional studies mainly focus on BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and products. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity of these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between queries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial search systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible optimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for relevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand for data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning processes, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The framework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data Selection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework through a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as well as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in both offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a well-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.</p></details> |  |

With zero-shot methods like DetectGPT, detection capabilities have reached impressive levels. However, the reliability of existing detectors in real-world applications remains underexplored. In this study, we present a new benchmark, DetectRL, highlighting that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection techniques still underperformed in this task. We collected human-written datasets from domains where LLMs are particularly prone to misuse. Using popular LLMs, we generated data that better aligns with real-world applications. Unlike previous studies, we employed heuristic rules to create adversarial LLM-generated text, simulating various prompts usages, human revisions like word substitutions, and writing noises like spelling mistakes. Our development of DetectRL reveals the strengths and limitations of current SOTA detectors. More importantly, we analyzed the potential impact of writing styles, model types, attack methods, the text lengths, and real-world human writing factors on different types of detectors. We believe DetectRL could serve as an effective benchmark for assessing detectors in real-world scenarios, evolving with advanced attack methods, thus providing more stressful evaluation to drive the development of more efficient detectors.

However, they were primarily evaluated on a few well known datasets like Defects4J, raising questions about their effectiveness on new datasets. In this study, we evaluate 11 top-performing LLMs on DEFECTS4J-TRANS, a new dataset derived from transforming Defects4J while maintaining the original semantics. Results from experiments on both Defects4J and DEFECTS4J-TRANS show that all studied LLMs have limited generalizability in APR tasks, with the average number of correct and plausible patches decreasing by 49.48% and 42.90%, respectively, on DEFECTS4J-TRANS. Further investigation into incorporating additional repair-relevant information in repair prompts reveals that, although this information significantly enhances the LLMs' capabilities (increasing the number of correct and plausible patches by up to 136.67% and 121.82%, respectively), performance still falls short of their original results. This indicates that prompt engineering alone is insufficient to substantially enhance LLMs' repair capabilities.

Our primary focus is on this theoretical realization rather than practical insights derived from experimental data.

This study explores the potential of replacing human interviewers with large language models (LLMs) to conduct scalable conversational interviews. Our goal is to assess the performance of AI Conversational Interviewing and to identify opportunities for improvement in a controlled environment. We conducted a small-scale, in-depth study with university students who were randomly assigned to a conversational interview by either AI or human interviewers, both employing identical questionnaires on political topics. Various quantitative and qualitative measures assessed interviewer adherence to guidelines, response quality, participant engagement, and overall interview efficacy. The findings indicate the viability of AI Conversational Interviewing in producing quality data comparable to traditional methods, with the added benefit of scalability. We publish our data and materials for re-use and present specific recommendations for effective implementation.</p></details> |  |

We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, it has never been investigated whether the LLMs' hallucination is possibly usable to generate negative reasoning for facilitating the detection of fake news. This study proposes a novel supervised self-reinforced reasoning rectification approach - SR$^3$ that yields both common reasonable reasoning and wrong understandings (negative reasoning) for news via LLMs reflection for semantic consistency learning. Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - \emph{NRFE}, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - \emph{NRFE-D} that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from \emph{NRFE}.

While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations via uncertainty estimation or query rejection, they suffer from computational inefficiency or sacrificed helpfulness. To address these issues, we propose the Explicit Knowledge Boundary Modeling (EKBM) framework, integrating fast and slow reasoning systems to harmonize reliability and usability. The framework first employs a fast-thinking model to generate confidence-labeled responses, enabling immediate use of high-confidence outputs. For uncertain predictions, a slow refinement model conducts targeted reasoning to improve accuracy. To align model behavior with our proposed object, we propose a hybrid training pipeline, enhancing self-awareness without degrading task performance. Evaluations on dialogue state tracking tasks demonstrate that EKBM achieves superior model reliability over uncertainty-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that refinement substantially boosts accuracy while maintaining low computational overhead. Our work establishes a scalable paradigm for advancing LLM reliability and balancing accuracy and practical utility in error-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

However, they also present challenges, particularly in generating vaccine-related misinformation, which poses risks to public health. Despite research on human-authored misinformation, a notable gap remains in understanding how LLMs contribute to vaccine misinformation and how best to detect it. Existing benchmarks often overlook vaccine-specific misinformation and the diverse roles of misinformation spreaders. This paper introduces VaxGuard, a novel dataset designed to address these challenges. VaxGuard includes vaccine-related misinformation generated by multiple LLMs and provides a comprehensive framework for detecting misinformation across various roles. Our findings show that GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o consistently outperform other LLMs in detecting misinformation, especially when dealing with subtle or emotionally charged narratives. On the other hand, PHI3 and Mistral show lower performance, struggling with precision and recall in fear-driven contexts. Additionally, detection performance tends to decline as input text length increases, indicating the need for improved methods to handle larger content. These results highlight the importance of role-specific detection strategies and suggest that VaxGuard can serve as a key resource for improving the detection of LLM-generated vaccine misinformation.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

| **[Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09066v1)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.09066v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.</p></details> | 4 figures |

But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Recent methods predominantly adapt Video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps to handle temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' powerful semantic understanding. In this work, we introduce MeCo, a novel timestamp-free framework that enables video LLMs to fully harness their intrinsic semantic capabilities for temporal localization tasks. Rather than outputting boundary timestamps, MeCo partitions videos into holistic event and transition segments based on the proposed structural token generation and grounding pipeline, derived from video LLMs' temporal structure understanding capability. We further propose a query-focused captioning task that compels the LLM to extract fine-grained, event-specific details, bridging the gap between localization and higher-level semantics and enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal localization tasks show that MeCo consistently outperforms boundary-centric methods, underscoring the benefits of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While the research community has reasoned about SQL equivalence for decades, it poses considerable difficulties and no complete solutions exist. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capability in conversation, question answering and solving mathematics challenges. In this paper, we study if LLMs can be used to determine the equivalence between SQL queries under two notions of SQL equivalence (semantic equivalence and relaxed equivalence). To assist LLMs in generating high quality responses, we present two prompting techniques: Miniature & Mull and Explain & Compare. The former technique is used to evaluate the semantic equivalence in which it asks LLMs to execute a query on a simple database instance and then explore if a counterexample exists by modifying the database. The latter technique is used to evaluate the relaxed equivalence in which it asks LLMs to explain the queries and then compare if they contain significant logical differences. Our experiments demonstrate using our techniques, LLMs is a promising tool to help data engineers in writing semantically equivalent SQL queries, however challenges still persist, and is a better metric for evaluating SQL generation than the popular execution accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, many data catalogs within organizations suffer from limited searchability due to inadequate metadata like asset descriptions. Hence, there is a need of content generation solution to enrich and curate metadata in a scalable way. This paper explores the challenges associated with metadata creation and proposes a unique prompt enrichment idea of leveraging existing metadata content using retrieval based few-shot technique tied with generative large language models (LLM). The literature also considers finetuning an LLM on existing content and studies the behavior of few-shot pretrained LLM (Llama, GPT3.5) vis-\`a-vis few-shot finetuned LLM (Llama2-7b) by evaluating their performance based on accuracy, factual grounding, and toxicity. Our preliminary results exhibit more than 80% Rouge-1 F1 for the generated content. This implied 87%- 88% of instances accepted as is or curated with minor edits by data stewards. By automatically generating descriptions for tables and columns in most accurate way, the research attempts to provide an overall framework for enterprises to effectively scale metadata curation and enrich its data catalog thereby vastly improving the data catalog searchability and overall usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in 5th International Conference on NLP & Text Mining (NLTM 2025)</p></details> |

However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations. We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. 11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs. JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.</p></details> |  |

This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews (full-duplex dialogues) at scale. We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training. Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 80th AAPOR Conference 2025</p></details> |

In the recent LLM era, research has been conducted to automate document relevance labels, as these labels have traditionally been assigned by crowd-sourced workers - a process that is both time and consuming and costly. This study focuses on LLM-generated usefulness labels, a crucial evaluation metric that considers the user's search intents and task objectives, an aspect where relevance falls short. Our experiment utilizes task-level, query-level, and document-level features along with user search behavior signals, which are essential in defining the usefulness of a document. Our research finds that (i) pre-trained LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by understanding the comprehensive search task session, (ii) pre-trained LLMs perform better judgement in short search sessions when provided with search session contexts. Additionally, we investigated whether LLMs can capture the unique divergence between relevance and usefulness, along with conducting an ablation study to identify the most critical metrics for accurate usefulness label generation. In conclusion, this work explores LLM-generated usefulness labels by evaluating critical metrics and optimizing for practicality in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

While traditional aids such as white canes and guide dogs are invaluable, they fall short in delivering detailed spatial information and precise guidance to desired locations. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) offer new avenues for enhancing assistive navigation. In this paper, we introduce Guide-LLM, an embodied LLM-based agent designed to assist PVI in navigating large indoor environments. Our approach features a novel text-based topological map that enables the LLM to plan global paths using a simplified environmental representation, focusing on straight paths and right-angle turns to facilitate navigation. Additionally, we utilize the LLM's commonsense reasoning for hazard detection and personalized path planning based on user preferences. Simulated experiments demonstrate the system's efficacy in guiding PVI, underscoring its potential as a significant advancement in assistive technology. The results highlight Guide-LLM's ability to offer efficient, adaptive, and personalized navigation assistance, pointing to promising advancements in this field.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3.

In this study, we evaluate the performance and robustness of LLMs for materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction across diverse real-world and adversarial conditions. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study showcases unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance recovery from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

To validate judge systems, evaluators collect multiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, and then aggregate the ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. High agreement rates between these gold labels and judge system ratings are then taken as a sign of good judge system performance. In many cases, however, items or rating criteria may be ambiguous, or there may be principled disagreement among human raters. In such settings, gold labels may not exist for many of the items. In this paper, we introduce a framework for LLM-as-a-judge validation in the absence of gold labels. We present a theoretical analysis drawing connections between different measures of judge system performance under different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We also demonstrate empirically that existing validation approaches can select judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 34% worse than the systems selected by alternative approaches that we describe. Based on our findings, we provide concrete recommendations for developing more reliable approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing key-value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create significant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly "know" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k selection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest.</p></details> |  |

Conventional DST methods struggle with open-domain dialogues and noisy inputs. Motivated by the generative capabilities of LLMs, our Natural Language DST (NL-DST) framework trains an LLM to directly synthesize human-readable state descriptions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 and Taskmaster-1 datasets that NL-DST significantly outperforms rule-based and discriminative BERT-based DST baselines, as well as generative slot-filling GPT-2 DST models, in both Joint Goal Accuracy and Slot Accuracy. Ablation studies and human evaluations further validate the effectiveness of natural language state generation, highlighting its robustness to noise and enhanced interpretability.

Traditional approaches often fall short in capturing these complexities, particularly when relying on manually annotated dialogue relations. This paper introduces Speaker-Attentive LLM (SA-LLM), a novel generative model that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and a speaker-aware contrastive learning strategy to address these challenges. SA-LLM incorporates a speaker-attributed input encoding and a contrastive learning objective to implicitly learn contextual coherence and speaker roles without explicit relation annotations. Extensive experiments on the Ubuntu IRC and Movie Dialogues datasets demonstrate that SA-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in automatic and human evaluations, achieving superior performance in fluency, coherence, informativeness, and response diversity. Ablation studies and detailed error analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed speaker-attentive training approach, highlighting its robustness across different speaker roles and context lengths.

In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans' appropriate reliance and task performance.

Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: (1) LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text, (2) LLMs do not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis. (3) Contrary to common beliefs, LLMs' understanding of time series does not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities. (4) LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different models. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand trivial time series anomalies, we have no evidence that they can understand more subtle real-world anomalies. Many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. All synthetic dataset generators, final prompts, and evaluation scripts have been made available in https://github.com/rose-stl-lab/anomllm.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment borrow social science methodologies but often overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three assumptions behind current evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that cultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation design, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of issues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability: that LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives. Through experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading LLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats, incoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic behavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause the results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in methodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that narrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint an incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties. Overall, these results highlight significant limitations of current approaches for evaluating the cultural alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation.

However, existing LLM-based review systems face significant challenges, including limited domain expertise, hallucinated reasoning, and a lack of structured evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeepReview, a multi-stage framework designed to emulate expert reviewers by incorporating structured analysis, literature retrieval, and evidence-based argumentation. Using DeepReview-13K, a curated dataset with structured annotations, we train DeepReviewer-14B, which outperforms CycleReviewer-70B with fewer tokens. In its best mode, DeepReviewer-14B achieves win rates of 88.21\% and 80.20\% against GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations. Our work sets a new benchmark for LLM-based paper review, with all resources publicly available. The code, model, dataset and demo have be released in http://ai-researcher.net.</p></details> |  |

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning and Sampling-Augmented MCQ Difficulty Prediction via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08551v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08551v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) is a crucial factor for educational assessments. Predicting MCQ difficulty is challenging since it requires understanding both the complexity of reaching the correct option and the plausibility of distractors, i.e., incorrect options. In this paper, we propose a novel, two-stage method to predict the difficulty of MCQs. First, to better estimate the complexity of each MCQ, we use large language models (LLMs) to augment the reasoning steps required to reach each option. We use not just the MCQ itself but also these reasoning steps as input to predict the difficulty. Second, to capture the plausibility of distractors, we sample knowledge levels from a distribution to account for variation among students responding to the MCQ. This setup, inspired by item response theory (IRT), enable us to estimate the likelihood of students selecting each (both correct and incorrect) option. We align these predictions with their ground truth values, using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization objective, and use estimated likelihoods to predict MCQ difficulty. We evaluate our method on two real-world \emph{math} MCQ and response datasets with ground truth difficulty values estimated using IRT. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all baselines, up to a 28.3\% reduction in mean squared error and a 34.6\% improvement in the coefficient of determination. We also qualitatively discuss how our novel method results in higher accuracy in predicting MCQ difficulty.</p></details> |  |

However, the rapid increase in the volume of research literature and the complex citation relationships make it difficult for researchers to quickly analyze and derive meaningful research trends. The development of large language models (LLMs) has provided a novel approach for automatically summarizing papers and generating innovative research ideas. However, existing paper-based idea generation methods either simply input papers into LLMs via prompts or form logical chains of creative development based on citation relationships, without fully exploiting the semantic information embedded in these citations. Inspired by knowledge graphs and human cognitive processes, we propose a framework called the Graph of AI Ideas (GoAI) for the AI research field, which is dominated by open-access papers. This framework organizes relevant literature into entities within a knowledge graph and summarizes the semantic information contained in citations into relations within the graph. This organization effectively reflects the relationships between two academic papers and the advancement of the AI research field. Such organization aids LLMs in capturing the current progress of research, thereby enhancing their creativity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating novel, clear, and effective research ideas.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Traditional supervised signal-based automatic metrics fail to capture semantic equivalence or handle the variability of open-ended responses, while human evaluation, though reliable, is resource-intensive. Leveraging LLMs as evaluators offers a promising alternative due to their strong language understanding and instruction-following capabilities. Taking advantage of these capabilities, we propose the Dynamic Arbitration Framework for Evaluation (DAFE), which employs two primary LLM-as-judges and engages a third arbitrator only in cases of disagreements. This selective arbitration prioritizes evaluation reliability while reducing unnecessary computational demands compared to conventional majority voting. DAFE utilizes task-specific reference answers with dynamic arbitration to enhance judgment accuracy, resulting in significant improvements in evaluation metrics such as Macro F1 and Cohen's Kappa. Through experiments, including a comprehensive human evaluation, we demonstrate DAFE's ability to provide consistent, scalable, and resource-efficient assessments, establishing it as a robust framework for evaluating free-form model outputs.</p></details> |  |

Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After a three-stage training approach, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception and understanding performance, and the combination of these two capabilities also unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating their complementary roles in MLLM.

However, existing compression methods introduce significant processing overhead and queuing delays, particularly in concurrent serving scenarios. We present \texttt{FastCache}, a novel serving framework that effectively addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a dynamic batching strategy that optimizes request scheduling across prefill, compression, and decode stages, and (2) an efficient KV-cache memory pool mechanism that eliminates memory fragmentation while maintaining high GPU utilization. Our comprehensive experiments on the GQA and MileBench datasets demonstrate that \texttt{FastCache} achieves up to 19.3$\times$ reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 12.1$\times$ improvement in throughput compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The system maintains stable performance under high-concurrency scenarios (up to 40 req/s) while reducing average memory consumption by 20\%. These results establish \texttt{FastCache} as an efficient solution for real-world LLM serving systems with KV-cache compression.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Traditional research often oversimplifies emotional tendencies and opinion evolution into numbers and formulas, neglecting that news and communication are conveyed through text, which limits these approaches. Hence, in this work, we propose an LLM-based simulation for the social opinion network to evaluate and counter polarization phenomena. We first construct three typical network structures to simulate different characteristics of social interactions. Then, agents interact based on recommendation algorithms and update their strategies through reasoning and analysis. By comparing these interactions with the classic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), the Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) model, and using echo chamber-related indices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in simulating opinion dynamics and reproducing phenomena such as opinion polarization and echo chambers. We propose two mitigation methods, active and passive nudges, that can help reduce echo chambers, specifically within language-based simulations. We hope our work will offer valuable insights and guidance for social polarization mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025</p></details> |

One promising application is investment recommendation. In this paper, we reveal a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendation, where LLMs exhibit systematic preferences for specific products. Such preferences can subtly influence user investment decisions, potentially leading to inflated valuations of products and financial bubbles, posing risks to both individual investors and market stability. To comprehensively study the product bias, we develop an automated pipeline to create a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). With this dataset, we present the bf first study on product bias in LLM investment recommendations. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit clear product preferences, such as certain stocks (e.g., `AAPL' from Apple and `MSFT' from Microsoft). Notably, this bias persists even after applying debiasing techniques. We urge AI researchers to take heed of the product bias in LLM investment recommendations and its implications, ensuring fairness and security in the digital space and market.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this purpose, we use AI auditing methodology that systematically evaluates performance of five LLMs (ChatGPT 4, Llama 3 (70B), Llama 3.1 (405B), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini) using prompts regarding a large set of statements fact-checked by professional journalists (16,513). Specifically, we use topic modeling and regression analysis to investigate which factors (e.g. topic of the prompt or the LLM type) affect evaluations of true, false, and mixed statements. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT 4 and Google Gemini achieved higher accuracy than other models, overall performance across models remains modest. Notably, the results indicate that models are better at identifying false statements, especially on sensitive topics such as COVID-19, American political controversies, and social issues, suggesting possible guardrails that may enhance accuracy on these topics. The major implication of our findings is that there are significant challenges for using LLMs for factchecking, including significant variation in performance across different LLMs and unequal quality of outputs for specific topics which can be attributed to deficits of training data. Our research highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in political fact-checking, suggesting potential avenues for further improvements in guardrails as well as fine-tuning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

While batching is commonly used to increase throughput, performance gains plateau beyond a certain batch size, especially with smaller models, a phenomenon that existing literature typically explains as a shift to the compute-bound regime. In this paper, through an in-depth GPU-level analysis, we reveal that large-batch inference remains memory-bound, with most GPU compute capabilities underutilized due to DRAM bandwidth saturation as the primary bottleneck. To address this, we propose a Batching Configuration Advisor (BCA) that optimizes memory allocation, reducing GPU memory requirements with minimal impact on throughput. The freed memory and underutilized GPU compute capabilities can then be leveraged by concurrent workloads. Specifically, we use model replication to improve serving throughput and GPU utilization. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions about LLM inference, offering new insights and practical strategies for improving resource utilization, particularly for smaller language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pol G...</summary><p>Pol G.

This study addresses the challenge of enhancing the emotional and contextual understanding of large language models (LLMs) in psychiatric applications. We introduce Emotion-Aware Embedding Fusion, a novel framework integrating hierarchical fusion and attention mechanisms to prioritize semantic and emotional features in therapy transcripts. Our approach combines multiple emotion lexicons, including NRC Emotion Lexicon, VADER, WordNet, and SentiWordNet, with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Flan-T5, LLAMA 2, DeepSeek-R1, and ChatGPT 4. Therapy session transcripts, comprising over 2,000 samples are segmented into hierarchical levels (word, sentence, and session) using neural networks, while hierarchical fusion combines these features with pooling techniques to refine emotional representations. Atten-tion mechanisms, including multi-head self-attention and cross-attention, further prioritize emotional and contextual features, enabling temporal modeling of emotion-al shifts across sessions. The processed embeddings, computed using BERT, GPT-3, and RoBERTa are stored in the Facebook AI similarity search vector database, which enables efficient similarity search and clustering across dense vector spaces. Upon user queries, relevant segments are retrieved and provided as context to LLMs, enhancing their ability to generate empathetic and con-textually relevant responses. The proposed framework is evaluated across multiple practical use cases to demonstrate real-world applicability, including AI-driven therapy chatbots. The system can be integrated into existing mental health platforms to generate personalized responses based on retrieved therapy session data.</p></details> |  |

These attacks manipulate LLMs to generate harmful or unethical content by crafting adversarial prompts. While much of the current research on jailbreak attacks has focused on single-turn interactions, it has largely overlooked the impact of historical dialogues on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak paradigm, Dialogue Injection Attack (DIA), which leverages the dialogue history to enhance the success rates of such attacks. DIA operates in a black-box setting, requiring only access to the chat API or knowledge of the LLM's chat template. We propose two methods for constructing adversarial historical dialogues: one adapts gray-box prefilling attacks, and the other exploits deferred responses. Our experiments show that DIA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent LLMs, including Llama-3.1 and GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate that DIA can bypass 5 different defense mechanisms, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Given the strong professional demands of film music production, we propose the FilmComposer, simulating the actual workflows of professional musicians. FilmComposer is the first to combine large generative models with a multi-agent approach, leveraging the advantages of both waveform music and symbolic music generation. Additionally, FilmComposer is the first to focus on the three core elements of music production for film-audio quality, musicality, and musical development-and introduces various controls, such as rhythm, semantics, and visuals, to enhance these key aspects. Specifically, FilmComposer consists of the visual processing module, rhythm-controllable MusicGen, and multi-agent assessment, arrangement and mix. In addition, our framework can seamlessly integrate into the actual music production pipeline and allows user intervention in every step, providing strong interactivity and a high degree of creative freedom. Furthermore, we propose MusicPro-7k which includes 7,418 film clips, music, description, rhythm spots and main melody, considering the lack of a professional and high-quality film music dataset.

We propose LLM4MAC, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) within a reinforcement learning paradigm to drive MAC protocol emergence. By reformulating uplink data transmission scheduling as a semantics-generalized partially observable Markov game (POMG), LLM4MAC encodes network operations in natural language, while proximal policy optimization (PPO) ensures continuous alignment with the evolving network dynamics. A structured identity embedding (SIE) mechanism further enables robust coordination among heterogeneous agents. Extensive simulations demonstrate that on top of a compact LLM, which is purposefully selected to balance performance with resource efficiency, the protocol emerging from LLM4MAC outperforms comparative baselines in throughput and generalization.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, developing such attacks remains challenging due to diverse real-world environments and the requirement for maintaining visual naturality. Building upon this challenge, we reformulate physical adversarial attacks as a one-shot patch generation problem. Our approach generates adversarial patches through a deep generative model that considers the specific scene context, enabling direct physical deployment in matching environments. The primary challenge lies in simultaneously achieving two objectives: generating adversarial patches that effectively mislead object detection systems while determining contextually appropriate deployment within the scene. We propose MAGIC (Mastering Physical Adversarial Generation In Context), a novel framework powered by multi-modal LLM agents to address these challenges. MAGIC automatically understands scene context and generates adversarial patch through the synergistic interaction of language and vision capabilities. In particular, MAGIC orchestrates three specialized LLM agents: The adv-patch generation agent (GAgent) masters the creation of deceptive patches through strategic prompt engineering for text-to-image models. The adv-patch deployment agent (DAgent) ensures contextual coherence by determining optimal deployment strategies based on scene understanding. The self-examination agent (EAgent) completes this trilogy by providing critical oversight and iterative refinement of both processes. We validate our method on both digital and physical levels, i.e., nuImage and manually captured real-world scenes, where both statistical and visual results prove that our MAGIC is powerful and effective for attacking widely applied object detection systems, i.e., YOLO and DETR series.</p></details> |  |

There is a significant amount of research utilizing both conventional non-learning methods and modern data-driven approaches, focusing on using both single-exposed and multi-exposed LDR for HDR image reconstruction. However, most current state-of-the-art methods require high-quality paired {LDR,HDR} datasets for model training. In addition, there is limited literature on using unpaired datasets for this task, that is, the model learns a mapping between domains, i.e., {LDR,HDR}. This paper proposes LLM-HDR, a method that integrates the perception of Large Language Models (LLM) into a modified semantic- and cycle-consistent adversarial architecture that utilizes unpaired {LDR,HDR} datasets for training. The method introduces novel artifact- and exposure-aware generators to address visual artifact removal and an encoder and loss to address semantic consistency, another under-explored topic. LLM-HDR is the first to use an LLM for the {LDR,HDR} translation task in a self-supervised setup. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmark datasets and reconstructs high-quality HDR images.

To address these limitations, we propose a group-aware personalization framework, Group Preference Alignment (GPA), that identifies context-specific variations in conversational preferences across user groups and then steers LLMs to address those preferences. Our approach consists of two steps: (1) Group-Aware Preference Extraction, where maximally divergent user-group preferences are extracted from real-world conversation logs and distilled into interpretable rubrics, and (2) Tailored Response Generation, which leverages these rubrics through two methods: a) Context-Tuned Inference (GAP-CT), that dynamically adjusts responses via context-dependent prompt instructions, and b) Rubric-Finetuning Inference (GPA-FT), which uses the rubrics to generate contrastive synthetic data for personalization of group-specific models via alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves alignment of the output with respect to user preferences and outperforms baseline methods, while maintaining robust performance on standard benchmarks.</p></details> | 23 pages |

These models often struggle with understanding the tacit knowledge embedded in systems, such as responsibility allocation and collaboration across different modules. To address this gap, we introduce the concept and framework of \textbf{Code Digital Twin}, a conceptual representation of tacit knowledge that captures the concepts, functionalities, and design rationales behind code elements, co-evolving with the software. A code digital twin is constructed using a methodology that combines knowledge extraction from both structured and unstructured sources--such as source code, documentation, and change histories--leveraging LLMs, static analysis tools, and human expertise. This framework can empower LLMs for software maintenance tasks such as issue localization and repository-level code generation by providing tacit knowledge as contexts. Based on the proposed methodology, we explore the key challenges and opportunities involved in the continuous construction and refinement of code digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>A vis...</summary><p>A vision paper that will be continuously updated</p></details> |

CIBER addresses the inherent uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) by evaluating response consistency across diverse interrogation probes. By focusing on the behavioral analysis of LLMs without requiring access to their internal information, CIBER is applicable to both white-box and black-box models. Furthermore, CIBER operates in an unsupervised manner, enabling easy generalization across various scientific domains. Comprehensive evaluations conducted using LLMs with varying levels of linguistic proficiency reveal CIBER's superior performance compared to conventional RAG approaches. These findings not only highlight the effectiveness of CIBER but also provide valuable insights for future advancements in LLM-based scientific claim verification.</p></details> |  |

Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the novel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the physical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure the safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined safety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust LLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety specifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves potential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a possibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures safety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking attacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans from 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also demonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive attacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to perform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to mitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches and benchmarks assume data points to-be-forgotten are independent, ignoring their inter-connectivity - a fundamental characteristic of real-world data structures. In this paper, we propose PISTOL, a method for compiling structural datasets. PISTOL leverages the inherently structured nature of contractual relationships, offering several key benefits. First, it enables insights into the impact of structural data on unlearning effectiveness. Second, it provides precise and concise ground truths for clearer evaluation. Third, its attribute generation does not require input from pre-trained LLMs, mitigating confounding risks. Leveraging datasets synthesized using PISTOL, we demonstrate how data inter-connectivity impacts LLM unlearning. Specifically, (a) in both the pre-trained and fine-tuned models, unlearning difficulty increases as data inter-connectivity grows, (b) there is a positive correlation between the density of the knowledge graph and unlearning difficulty, and (c) when the to-be-forgotten data is skewed towards one domain, balancing retaining performance across all domains is challenging.</p></details> |  |

The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types, including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations. However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the validity of LLM-generated plans, visual demonstrations and online videos have been widely employed to guide the planning process. However, for manipulation tasks involving subtle movements but rich contact interactions, visual perception alone may be insufficient for the LLM to fully interpret the demonstration. Additionally, visual data provides limited information on force-related parameters and conditions, which are crucial for effective execution on real robots. In this paper, we introduce an in-context learning framework that incorporates tactile and force-torque information from human demonstrations to enhance LLMs' ability to generate plans for new task scenarios. We propose a bootstrapped reasoning pipeline that sequentially integrates each modality into a comprehensive task plan. This task plan is then used as a reference for planning in new task configurations. Real-world experiments on two different sequential manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving LLMs' understanding of multi-modal demonstrations and enhancing the overall planning performance.</p></details> |  |

Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 3 algorithms, 2024 IEEE 6th International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems, and Applications (TPS-ISA), Washington, DC, USA</p></details> |

However, their application in professional medical contexts remains underexplored, particularly in evaluating the quality of their reasoning processes alongside final outputs. Here, we introduce MedR-Bench, a benchmarking dataset of 1,453 structured patient cases, annotated with reasoning references derived from clinical case reports. Spanning 13 body systems and 10 specialties, it includes both common and rare diseases. To comprehensively evaluate LLM performance, we propose a framework encompassing three critical examination recommendation, diagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, simulating the entire patient care journey. To assess reasoning quality, we present the Reasoning Evaluator, a novel automated system that objectively scores free-text reasoning responses based on efficiency, actuality, and completeness using dynamic cross-referencing and evidence checks. Using this benchmark, we evaluate five state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and Gemini-2.0-Flash Thinking, etc. Our results show that current LLMs achieve over 85% accuracy in relatively simple diagnostic tasks when provided with sufficient examination results. However, performance declines in more complex tasks, such as examination recommendation and treatment planning. While reasoning outputs are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%, critical reasoning steps are frequently missed. These findings underscore both the progress and limitations of clinical LLMs. Notably, open-source models like DeepSeek-R1 are narrowing the gap with proprietary systems, highlighting their potential to drive accessible and equitable advancements in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

These studies have sought to understand developers' perspectives about using those tools, a fundamental pillar for successfully adopting LLM-based tools in Software Engineering. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of junior software developers' perspectives and use of LLM-based tools for software engineering (LLM4SE). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) following guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 56 primary studies, applying the definition for junior software developers as software developers with equal or less than five years of experience, including Computer Science/Software Engineering students. We found that the majority of the studies focused on comprehending the different aspects of integrating AI tools in SE. Only 8.9\% of the studies provide a clear definition for junior software developers, and there is no uniformity. Searching for relevant information is the most common task using LLM tools. ChatGPT was the most common LLM tool present in the studies (and experiments). A majority of the studies (83.9\%) report both positive and negative perceptions about the impact of adopting LLM tools. We also found and categorised advantages, challenges, and recommendations regarding LLM adoption. Our results indicate that developers are using LLMs not just for code generation, but also to improve their development skills. Critically, they are not just experiencing the benefits of adopting LLM tools, but they are also aware of at least a few LLM limitations, such as the generation of wrong suggestions, potential data leaking, and AI hallucination. Our findings offer implications for software engineering researchers, educators, and developers.</p></details> |  |

To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.</p></details> |  |

This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large Language Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has analysed these opinions with respect to the West, particularly the United States. However, insights thus produced may not be generalized in non-Western populations. With the widespread usage of LLM systems by users across several different walks of life, the cultural sensitivity of each generated output is of crucial interest. Our work proposes a novel method that quantitatively analyzes the opinions generated by LLMs, improving on previous work with regards to extracting the social demographics of the models. Our method measures the distance from an LLM's response to survey respondents, through Hamming Distance, to infer the demographic characteristics reflected in the model's outputs. We evaluate modern, open LLMs such as Llama and Mistral on surveys conducted in various global south countries, with a focus on India and other Asian nations, specifically assessing the model's performance on surveys related to religious tolerance and identity. Our analysis reveals that most open LLMs match a single homogeneous profile, varying across different countries/territories, which in turn raises questions about the risks of LLMs promoting a hegemonic worldview, and undermining perspectives of different minorities. Our framework may also be useful for future research investigating the complex intersection between training data, model architecture, and the resulting biases reflected in LLM outputs, particularly concerning sensitive topics like religious tolerance and identity.</p></details> |  |

The success of these models can largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably, data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long video data.

While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored. Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students and teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance problem-solving and learning experiences.</p></details> |  |

Using gradient-based analysis, the MINT model identifies whether particular data samples were included during the language model training phase, addressing growing concerns about data privacy in machine learning. The method was evaluated in seven Transformer-based models and six datasets comprising over 2.5 million sentences, focusing on text classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate MINTs robustness, achieving AUC scores between 85% and 99%, depending on data size and model architecture. These findings highlight MINTs potential as a scalable and reliable tool for auditing machine learning models, ensuring transparency, safeguarding sensitive data, and fostering ethical compliance in the deployment of AI/NLP technologies.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of fairness, diversity, and accuracy, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems.

To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled B\v{a}il\'ing in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.</p></details> |  |

Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.</p></details> |  |

Since effective moderation depends on understanding contextual cues, this imbalance increases the risk of improper moderation due to non-native moderators' limited cultural understanding. Through a user study, we identify that non-native moderators struggle with interpreting culturally-specific knowledge, sentiment, and internet culture in the hate speech moderation. To assist them, we present LLM-C3MOD, a human-LLM collaborative pipeline with three steps: (1) RAG-enhanced cultural context annotations; (2) initial LLM-based moderation; and (3) targeted human moderation for cases lacking LLM consensus. Evaluated on a Korean hate speech dataset with Indonesian and German participants, our system achieves 78% accuracy (surpassing GPT-4o's 71% baseline), while reducing human workload by 83.6%. Notably, human moderators excel at nuanced contents where LLMs struggle. Our findings suggest that non-native moderators, when properly supported by LLMs, can effectively contribute to cross-cultural hate speech moderation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Workshop - C3NLP (Workshop on Cross-Cultural Considerations in NLP)</p></details> |

This study proposes CoT-Drive, a novel approach that enhances motion forecasting by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method. We introduce a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy to effectively transfer LLMs' advanced scene understanding capabilities to lightweight language models (LMs), ensuring that CoT-Drive operates in real-time on edge devices while maintaining comprehensive scene understanding and generalization capabilities. By leveraging CoT prompting techniques for LLMs without additional training, CoT-Drive generates semantic annotations that significantly improve the understanding of complex traffic environments, thereby boosting the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Additionally, we present two new scene description datasets, Highway-Text and Urban-Text, designed for fine-tuning lightweight LMs to generate context-specific semantic annotations. Comprehensive evaluations of five real-world datasets demonstrate that CoT-Drive outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex traffic scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to consider the practical application of LLMs in this field. It pioneers the training and use of a lightweight LLM surrogate for motion forecasting, setting a new benchmark and showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs into AD systems.</p></details> |  |

However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench-the first benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10\% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness.

However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning, Drug Discovery</p></details> |

Notably, not all optimization objectives, such as complex hand-crafted perceptual metrics, text description, and intricate human feedback, can be instantiated with existing low-level losses, e.g., MSE loss, which presents a crucial challenge in optimizing image processing networks in an end-to-end manner. To eliminate this, our LossAgent introduces the powerful large language model (LLM) as the loss agent, where the rich textual understanding of prior knowledge empowers the loss agent with the potential to understand complex optimization objectives, trajectory, and state feedback from external environments in the optimization process of the low-level image processing networks. In particular, we establish the loss repository by incorporating existing loss functions that support the end-to-end optimization for low-level image processing. Then, we design the optimization-oriented prompt engineering for the loss agent to actively and intelligently decide the compositional weights for each loss in the repository at each optimization interaction, thereby achieving the required optimization trajectory for any customized optimization objectives. Extensive experiments on three typical low-level image processing tasks and multiple optimization objectives have shown the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed LossAgent.</p></details> | Update format |

Using intermediate language translations as contextual cues, we evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing English and Chinese translations into Portuguese. Results suggest that contextual information significantly improves translation quality for domain-specific datasets and potentially for linguistically distant language pairs, with diminishing returns observed in benchmarks with high linguistic variability. Additionally, we demonstrate that shallow fusion, a multi-source approach we apply within the NMT system, shows improved results when using high-resource languages as context for other translation pairs, highlighting the importance of strategic context language selection.</p></details> | 11 pages |

In the first stage, we leverage a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide an LLM in generating an initial layout (Layout-Init) from natural language descriptions, which ensures a user-friendly and intuitive design process. However, Layout-Init may lack precise geometric alignment and fine-grained structural details. To address this, the second stage employs a conditional diffusion model to refine Layout-Init into a final floorplan (Layout-Final) that better adheres to physical constraints and user requirements. Unlike prior methods, our approach effectively reduces the difficulty of floorplan generation learning without the need for extensive domain-specific training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics, which validates its effectiveness in practical home design applications.</p></details> |  |

Existing works mainly use data packing to alleviate this issue but fail to consider imbalanced attention computation and wasted communication overhead. This paper proposes Hierarchical Balance Packing (HBP), which designs a novel batch-construction method and training recipe to address those inefficiencies. In particular, the HBP constructs multi-level data packing groups, each optimized with a distinct packing length. It assigns training samples to their optimal groups and configures each group with the most effective settings, including sequential parallelism degree and gradient checkpointing configuration. To effectively utilize multi-level groups of data, we design a dynamic training pipeline specifically tailored to HBP, including curriculum learning, adaptive sequential parallelism, and stable loss. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time over multiple datasets and open-source models while maintaining strong performance. For the largest DeepSeek-V2 (236B) MOE model, our method speeds up the training by 2.4$\times$ with competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</p></details> |  |

They can serve as markers of individuality, cultural heritage, and personal history. However, using names as a core indicator of identity can lead to over-simplification of complex identities. When interacting with LLMs, user names are an important point of information for personalisation. Names can enter chatbot conversations through direct user input (requested by chatbots), as part of task contexts such as CV reviews, or as built-in memory features that store user information for personalisation. We study biases associated with names by measuring cultural presumptions in the responses generated by LLMs when presented with common suggestion-seeking queries, which might involve making assumptions about the user. Our analyses demonstrate strong assumptions about cultural identity associated with names present in LLM generations across multiple cultures. Our work has implications for designing more nuanced personalisation systems that avoid reinforcing stereotypes while maintaining meaningful customisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 13 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

However, existing GZSL is still limited to seen domains. In the current work, we study cross-domain GZSL (CDGZSL) which addresses GZSL towards unseen domains. Different from existing GZSL methods, CDGZSL constructs a common feature space across domains and acquires the corresponding intrinsic semantics shared among domains to transfer from seen to unseen domains. Considering the information asymmetry problem caused by redundant class semantics annotated with large language models (LLMs), we present Meta Domain Alignment Semantic Refinement (MDASR). Technically, MDASR consists of two parts: Inter-class similarity alignment, which eliminates the non-intrinsic semantics not shared across all domains under the guidance of inter-class feature relationships, and unseen-class meta generation, which preserves intrinsic semantics to maintain connectivity between seen and unseen classes by simulating feature generation. MDASR effectively aligns the redundant semantic space with the common feature space, mitigating the information asymmetry in CDGZSL. The effectiveness of MDASR is demonstrated on two datasets, Office-Home and Mini-DomainNet, and we have shared the LLM-based semantics for these datasets as a benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system. Code and models will be made available.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of No-Reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZhehuiWu/MP-HSIR.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.</p></details> | 10 figures, 3 pages |

However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration across diverse degradation scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical remote sensing applications.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA.

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner.

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing deweathering methods rely on increasing the network scale and data volume to achieve better performance which requires more expensive computing power. Also, many methods lack generalization for specific applications. In the traffic surveillance screener, the main challenges are snow removal and veil effect elimination. In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods. Our approach also demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy when applied to real traffic surveillance images.</p></details> |  |

More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve superior results compared to existing approaches on both the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

These models can serve as strong priors for image restoration. Existing methods often utilize techniques like ControlNet to sample high quality images with low quality images from these priors. However, ControlNet typically involves copying a large part of the original network, resulting in a significantly large number of parameters as the prior scales up. In this paper, we propose a relatively lightweight Adapter that leverages the powerful generative capabilities of pretrained priors to achieve photo-realistic image restoration. The Adapters can be adapt to both denoising UNet and DiT, and performs excellent.</p></details> |  |

Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step.

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal and opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction.

By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance.

Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14014v1)** | 2025-01-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.14014v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in image restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate realistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information.

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images.

Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

| **[Varformer: Adapting VAR's Generative Prior for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21063v1)** | 2024-12-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.21063v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models trained on extensive high-quality datasets effectively capture the structural and statistical properties of clean images, rendering them powerful priors for transforming degraded features into clean ones in image restoration. VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20596v1)** | 2024-12-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.20596v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance, instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing. Our codes will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ACCV2024</p></details> |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.20008v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details.

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

We show state-of-the-art video generation models struggle with this basic task, despite their visually impressive outputs. To remedy this problem, we find that fine-tuning on a relatively small amount of simulated videos is effective in inducing the dropping behavior in the model, and we can further improve results through a novel reward modeling procedure we introduce. Our study also reveals key limitations of post-training in generalization and distribution modeling.

Despite the dominant adoption of probability flow ODE-based samplers in practice due to their superior sampling efficiency and precision, rigorous statistical guarantees for these methods have remained elusive in the literature. This work develops the first end-to-end theoretical framework for deterministic ODE-based samplers that establishes near-minimax optimal guarantees under mild assumptions on target data distributions. Specifically, focusing on subgaussian distributions with $\beta$-H\"older smooth densities for $\beta\leq 2$, we propose a smooth regularized score estimator that simultaneously controls both the $L^2$ score error and the associated mean Jacobian error. Leveraging this estimator within a refined convergence analysis of the ODE-based sampling process, we demonstrate that the resulting sampler achieves the minimax rate in total variation distance, modulo logarithmic factors. Notably, our theory comprehensively accounts for all sources of error in the sampling process and does not require strong structural conditions such as density lower bounds or Lipschitz/smooth scores on target distributions, thereby covering a broad range of practical data distributions.</p></details> |  |

Based on this insight, we propose TPDiff, a unified framework to enhance training and inference efficiency. By dividing diffusion into several stages, our framework progressively increases frame rate along the diffusion process with only the last stage operating on full frame rate, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. To train the multi-stage diffusion model, we introduce a dedicated training framework: stage-wise diffusion. By solving the partitioned probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODE) of diffusion under aligned data and noise, our training strategy is applicable to various diffusion forms and further enhances training efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the generality of our method, demonstrating 50% reduction in training cost and 1.5x improvement in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://showlab.github.io/TPDiff/</p></details> |

Our method DAWN-FM: Data-AWare and Noise-informed Flow Matching incorporates data and noise embedding, allowing the model to access representations about the measured data explicitly and also account for noise in the observations, making it particularly robust in scenarios where data is noisy or incomplete. By learning a time-dependent velocity field, FM not only provides accurate solutions but also enables uncertainty quantification by generating multiple plausible outcomes. Unlike pre-trained diffusion models, which may struggle in highly ill-posed settings, our approach is trained specifically for each inverse problem and adapts to varying noise levels. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method through extensive numerical experiments on tasks such as image deblurring and tomography.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods primarily focus on generating whole-organ or large-tissue structures, showing limited effectiveness for organs with fine-grained structure. Due to stringent topological consistency, fragile coronary features, and complex 3D morphological heterogeneity in cardiac imaging, accurately reconstructing fine-grained anatomical details of the heart remains a great challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the Fine-grained Cardiac image Synthesis(FCaS) framework, established on 3D template conditional diffusion model. FCaS achieves precise cardiac structure generation using Template-guided Conditional Diffusion Model (TCDM) through bidirectional mechanisms, which provides the fine-grained topological structure information of target image through the guidance of template. Meanwhile, we design a deformable Mask Generation Module (MGM) to mitigate the scarcity of high-quality and diverse reference mask in the generation process. Furthermore, to alleviate the confusion caused by imprecise synthetic images, we propose a Confidence-aware Adaptive Learning (CAL) strategy to facilitate the pre-training of downstream segmentation tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Skip-Sampling Variance (SSV) estimation to obtain confidence maps, which are subsequently employed to rectify the pre-training on downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that images generated from FCaS achieves state-of-the-art performance in topological consistency and visual quality, which significantly facilitates the downstream tasks as well. Code will be released in the future.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

However, missing data is a common challenge due to privacy restrictions, cost, and technical issues, making many existing multi-modal models unreliable. To address this, we propose a new multi-model model called Mixture of Experts, Symmetric Aligning, and Reconstruction (MoSARe), a deep learning framework that handles incomplete multimodal data while maintaining high accuracy. MoSARe integrates expert selection, cross-modal attention, and contrastive learning to improve feature representation and decision-making. Our results show that MoSARe outperforms existing models in situations when the data is complete. Furthermore, it provides reliable predictions even when some data are missing. This makes it especially useful in real-world healthcare settings, including resource-limited environments. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/NazaninMn/MoSARe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Survival Prediction with the Latent Differentiation Conditional Variational AutoEncoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09496v1)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.09496v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has received increasing attention for survival prediction of human cancers. However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data is high, which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A common way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic representations from the pathology images. Nevertheless, such strategy still faces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the genomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative framework. To address the above challenges, we propose a Conditional Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-CVAE) for robust multimodal survival prediction, even with missing genomic data. Specifically, a Variational Information Bottleneck Transformer (VIB-Trans) module is proposed to learn compressed pathological representations from the gigapixel WSIs. To generate different functional genomic features, we develop a novel Latent Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-VAE) to learn the common and specific posteriors for the genomic embeddings with diverse functions. Finally, we use the product-of-experts technique to integrate the genomic common posterior and image posterior for the joint latent distribution estimation in LD-CVAE. We test the effectiveness of our method on five different cancer datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority in both complete and missing modality scenarios.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

Text PLMs cannot process single-cell RNA sequencing data, while cell PLMs lack the ability to handle free text, restricting their use in multimodal tasks. Existing efforts to bridge these modalities often suffer from information loss or inadequate single-modal pre-training, leading to suboptimal performances. To address these challenges, we propose Single-Cell MultiModal Generative Pre-trained Transformer (scMMGPT), a unified PLM for joint cell and text modeling. scMMGPT effectively integrates the state-of-the-art cell and text PLMs, facilitating cross-modal knowledge sharing for improved performance. To bridge the text-cell modality gap, scMMGPT leverages dedicated cross-modal projectors, and undergoes extensive pre-training on 27 million cells -- the largest dataset for multimodal cell-text PLMs to date. This large-scale pre-training enables scMMGPT to excel in joint cell-text tasks, achieving an 84\% relative improvement of textual discrepancy for cell description generation, 20.5\% higher accuracy for cell type annotation, and 4\% improvement in $k$-NN accuracy for text-conditioned pseudo-cell generation, outperforming baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.09366v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in fine-grained face comprehension remain largely underexplored. Given its pivotal role in human-centric intelligence, developing VMLLMs for facial understanding holds a fundamental problem. To address this gap, we propose FaVChat, the first VMLLM specifically designed for fine-grained facial video understanding. To facilitate its training, we construct a large-scale facial video dataset comprising over 60k videos, with the majority annotated with 83 fine-grained facial attributes. These attributes are incorporated to enrich GPT-4o-generated captions, yielding 60k high-quality video-summary pairs and an additional 170k fine-grained question-answering (QA) pairs. To effectively capture rich facial clues, we propose a hybrid model architecture composed of a general visual encoder, a dedicated facial encoder, and a mixture-of-experts-enhanced adapter for adaptive fusion of multi-source visual features. To mitigate information loss during feature transformation, we extract multi-granularity representations from the facial encoder and integrate them into the subsequent LLM. This design enhances the model's ability to comprehend and respond to questions involving diverse levels of visual details. We employ a progressive training paradigm, transitioning from video summarization to a high-quality subset of video QA, gradually increasing task complexity to enhance the model's fine-grained visual perception. We conduct extensive zero-shot evaluation on a couple of public benchmarks, demonstrating that FaVChat consistently surpasses existing VMLLMs across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network-powered Wildfire Forecasting System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05971v2)** | 2025-03-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.05971v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most dangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel image compression framework, Semantically Disentangled Image Compression (SEDIC) in this paper. Our proposed SEDIC leverages large multimodal models (LMMs) to disentangle the image into several essential semantic information, including an extremely compressed reference image, overall and object-level text descriptions, and the semantic masks. A multi-stage semantic decoder is designed to progressively restore the transmitted reference image object-by-object, ultimately producing high-quality and perceptually consistent reconstructions. In each decoding stage, a pre-trained controllable diffusion model is utilized to restore the object details on the reference image conditioned by the text descriptions and semantic masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at ultra-low bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to address two primary challenges faced by artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in the sports domain: how to use different modality data for the analysis and how to explain the rationale of the outcome from multimodal perspectives. To address these challenges, PassAI has two processing streams for multimodal information: tracking image data and passer's stats and classifying pass success and failure. After completing the classification, it provides a rationale by either calculating the relative contribution between the different modality data or providing more detailed contribution factors within the modality. The results of the experiment with 6,349 passes of data obtained from professional soccer games revealed that PassAI showed higher classification performance than state-of-the-art algorithms by >5% and could visualize the rationale of the pass success/failure for both tracking and stats data. These results highlight the importance of using multimodality data in the sports domain to increase the performance of the artificial intelligence algorithm and explainability of the outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate spurious bias in MLLMs and introduce SpurLens, a pipeline that leverages GPT-4 and open-set object detectors to automatically identify spurious visual cues without human supervision. Our findings reveal that spurious correlations cause two major failure modes in MLLMs: (1) over-reliance on spurious cues for object recognition, where removing these cues reduces accuracy, and (2) object hallucination, where spurious cues amplify the hallucination by over 10x. We validate our findings in various MLLMs and datasets. Beyond diagnosing these failures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling and reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root causes of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious correlations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

While earlier work has applied self-supervised learning (SSL) to unlabeled data, its task-agnostic nature often results in learning suboptimal features for downstream tasks. Semi-supervised learning (SemiSL), which combines labeled and unlabeled data, offers a promising solution. However, existing multimodal SemiSL methods typically focus on unimodal or modality-shared features, ignoring valuable task-relevant modality-specific information, leading to a Modality Information Gap. In this paper, we propose STiL, a novel SemiSL tabular-image framework that addresses this gap by comprehensively exploring task-relevant information. STiL features a new disentangled contrastive consistency module to learn cross-modal invariant representations of shared information while retaining modality-specific information via disentanglement. We also propose a novel consensus-guided pseudo-labeling strategy to generate reliable pseudo-labels based on classifier consensus, along with a new prototype-guided label smoothing technique to refine pseudo-label quality with prototype embeddings, thereby enhancing task-relevant information learning in unlabeled data. Experiments on natural and medical image datasets show that STiL outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised/SSL/SemiSL image/multimodal approaches.

We present OmniMamba, the first linear-architecture-based multimodal generation model that generates both text and images through a unified next-token prediction paradigm. The model fully leverages Mamba-2's high computational and memory efficiency, extending its capabilities from text generation to multimodal generation. To address the data inefficiency of existing unified models, we propose two key innovations: (1) decoupled vocabularies to guide modality-specific generation, and (2) task-specific LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled two-stage training strategy to mitigate data imbalance between two tasks. Equipped with these techniques, OmniMamba achieves competitive performance with JanusFlow while surpassing Show-o across benchmarks, despite being trained on merely 2M image-text pairs, which is 1,000 times fewer than Show-o. Notably, OmniMamba stands out with outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 119.2 times speedup and 63% GPU memory reduction for long-sequence generation compared to Transformer-based counterparts.

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

Mean Radiant Temperature ($T_{mrt}$) is a key parameter for evaluating outdoor thermal comfort, especially in urban environments where radiation dynamics significantly impact human thermal exposure. Traditional methods of estimating $T_{mrt}$ rely on field measurements and computational simulations, both of which are resource intensive. This study introduces a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach that integrates shortwave and longwave radiation modeling with deep learning techniques. By leveraging a multimodal dataset that includes meteorological data, built environment characteristics, and fisheye image-derived shading information, our model enhances predictive accuracy while maintaining physical consistency. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PINN framework outperforms conventional deep learning models, with the best-performing configurations achieving an RMSE of 3.50 and an $R^2$ of 0.88. This approach highlights the potential of physics-informed machine learning in bridging the gap between computational modeling and real-world applications, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for urban thermal comfort assessments.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual understanding capabilities, they arguably lack accurate perception abilities, e.g. the stage-of-the-art model Qwen2-VL only achieves a 43.9 recall rate on the COCO dataset, limiting many tasks requiring the combination of perception and understanding. In this work, we aim to bridge this perception gap from both model designing and data development perspectives. We first introduce ChatRex, an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint training of perception and understanding. After a three-stage training approach, ChatRex demonstrates strong perception and understanding performance, and the combination of these two capabilities also unlocks many attractive applications, demonstrating their complementary roles in MLLM.

Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

However, this type of data is costly to collect, limiting the extension of MMT to other language pairs for which such data does not exist. In this work, we propose a method to bypass the need for fully supervised data to train MMT systems, using multimodal English data only. Our method, called ZeroMMT, consists in adapting a strong text-only machine translation (MT) model by training it on a mixture of two objectives: visually conditioned masked language modelling and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original and new MMT outputs. We evaluate on standard MMT benchmarks and the recently released CoMMuTE, a contrastive benchmark aiming to evaluate how well models use images to disambiguate English sentences. We obtain disambiguation performance close to state-of-the-art MMT models trained additionally on fully supervised examples. To prove that our method generalizes to languages with no fully supervised training data available, we extend the CoMMuTE evaluation dataset to three new languages: Arabic, Russian and Chinese. We further show that we can control the trade-off between disambiguation capabilities and translation fidelity at inference time using classifier-free guidance and without any additional data.

| **[Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence: Supercharging Multimodal LLMs with an Uncertainty-Aware Agentic Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08308v1)** | 2025-03-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.08308v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in tasks like visual question answering (VQA) but still face challenges in multimodal reasoning. Recent works adapt agentic frameworks or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. However, CoT-based multimodal reasoning often demands costly data annotation and fine-tuning, while agentic approaches relying on external tools risk introducing unreliable output from these tools. In this paper, we propose Seeing and Reasoning with Confidence (SRICE), a training-free multimodal reasoning framework that integrates external vision models with uncertainty quantification (UQ) into an MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, SRICE guides the inference process by allowing MLLM to autonomously select regions of interest through multi-stage interactions with the help of external tools. We propose to use a conformal prediction-based approach to calibrate the output of external tools and select the optimal tool by estimating the uncertainty of an MLLM's output. Our experiment shows that the average improvement of SRICE over the base MLLM is 4.6% on five datasets and the performance on some datasets even outperforms fine-tuning-based methods, revealing the significance of ensuring reliable tool use in an MLLM agent.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-R1 .</p></details> |  |

Most segmentation LMMs also remain confined to sparse predictions, restricting their applicability in open-set environments. In contrast, we propose ROSE, a Revolutionary Open-set dense SEgmentation LMM, which enables dense mask prediction and open-category generation through patch-wise perception. Our method treats each image patch as an independent region of interest candidate, enabling the model to predict both dense and sparse masks simultaneously. Additionally, a newly designed instruction-response paradigm takes full advantage of the generation and generalization capabilities of LMMs, achieving category prediction independent of closed-set constraints or predefined categories. To further enhance mask detail and category precision, we introduce a conversation-based refinement paradigm, integrating the prediction result from previous step with textual prompt for revision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ROSE achieves competitive performance across various segmentation tasks in a unified framework. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most published chemical reactions are not available in machine-readable form, limiting the broader application of AI in this field. The extraction of published chemical reactions into structured databases still relies heavily on manual curation, and robust automatic parsing of chemical reaction images into machine-readable data remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Reaction Image Multimodal large language model (RxnIM), the first multimodal large language model specifically designed to parse chemical reaction images into machine-readable reaction data. RxnIM not only extracts key chemical components from reaction images but also interprets the textual content that describes reaction conditions. Together with specially designed large-scale dataset generation method to support model training, our approach achieves excellent performance, with an average F1 score of 88% on various benchmarks, surpassing literature methods by 5%. This represents a crucial step toward the automatic construction of large databases of machine-readable reaction data parsed from images in the chemistry literature, providing essential data resources for AI research in chemistry. The source code, model checkpoints, and datasets developed in this work are released under permissive licenses.

To enable agents to effectively learn behavioral patterns across diverse tasks, a key challenge lies in modeling the intricate relationships among observations, actions, and language. To this end, we propose Optimus-2, a novel Minecraft agent that incorporates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for high-level planning, alongside a Goal-Observation-Action Conditioned Policy (GOAP) for low-level control. GOAP contains (1) an Action-guided Behavior Encoder that models causal relationships between observations and actions at each timestep, then dynamically interacts with the historical observation-action sequence, consolidating it into fixed-length behavior tokens, and (2) an MLLM that aligns behavior tokens with open-ended language instructions to predict actions auto-regressively. Moreover, we introduce a high-quality Minecraft Goal-Observation-Action (MGOA)} dataset, which contains 25,000 videos across 8 atomic tasks, providing about 30M goal-observation-action pairs. The automated construction method, along with the MGOA dataset, can contribute to the community's efforts to train Minecraft agents. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-2 exhibits superior performance across atomic tasks, long-horizon tasks, and open-ended instruction tasks in Minecraft.

However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, grounding-IQA. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates the model grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed task paradigm, dataset, and benchmark facilitate the more fine-grained IQA application.

Additionally, single-task-oriented sensing systems fail to address users' diverse demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-driven integrated multimodal sensing and communication (SIMAC) framework. This framework leverages a joint source-channel coding architecture to achieve simultaneous sensing decoding and transmission of sensing results. Specifically, SIMAC first introduces a multimodal semantic fusion (MSF) network, which employs two extractors to extract semantic information from radar signals and images, respectively. MSF then applies cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these unimodal features and generate multimodal semantic representations. Secondly, we present a large language model (LLM)-based semantic encoder (LSE), where relevant communication parameters and multimodal semantics are mapped into a unified latent space and input to the LLM, enabling channel-adaptive semantic encoding. Thirdly, a task-oriented sensing semantic decoder (SSD) is proposed, in which different decoded heads are designed according to the specific needs of tasks. Simultaneously, a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to train the SIMAC framework, achieving diverse sensing services. Finally, experimental simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves diverse sensing services and higher accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Most methods adopt Markovian assumptions for preference modeling (PM), which overlook the temporal dependencies within robot behavior trajectories that impact human evaluations. While recent works have utilized sequence modeling to mitigate this by learning sequential non-Markovian rewards, they ignore the multimodal nature of robot trajectories, which consist of elements from two distinctive modalities: state and action. As a result, they often struggle to capture the complex interplay between these modalities that significantly shapes human preferences. In this paper, we propose a multimodal sequence modeling approach for PM by disentangling state and action modalities. We introduce a multimodal transformer network, named PrefMMT, which hierarchically leverages intra-modal temporal dependencies and inter-modal state-action interactions to capture complex preference patterns. We demonstrate that PrefMMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PM baselines on locomotion tasks from the D4RL benchmark and manipulation tasks from the Meta-World benchmark.</p></details> |  |

The textual and visual latent features are integrated using proposed fusion techniques, namely the Basic Fusion Model, Self Attention Fusion Model, and Dual Attention Fusion Model. Experiments on three datasets, Memotion 7k dataset, MVSA single dataset, and MVSA multi dataset, demonstrate the viability and practicality of the proposed multimodal architecture.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The rise of large language models has spurred interest in BEV-based captioning to understand object behavior in the surrounding environment. However, existing approaches treat perception and captioning as separate tasks, focusing on the performance of only one task and overlooking the potential benefits of multimodal alignment. To bridge this gap between modalities, we introduce MTA, a novel multimodal task alignment framework that boosts both BEV perception and captioning. MTA consists of two key components: (1) BEV-Language Alignment (BLA), a contextual learning mechanism that aligns the BEV scene representations with ground-truth language representations, and (2) Detection-Captioning Alignment (DCA), a cross-modal prompting mechanism that aligns detection and captioning outputs. MTA seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art baselines during training, adding no extra computational complexity at runtime. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and TOD3Cap datasets show that MTA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks, achieving a 10.7% improvement in challenging rare perception scenarios and a 9.2% improvement in captioning. These results underscore the effectiveness of unified alignment in reconciling BEV-based perception and captioning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement.

However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot medical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features and available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease recognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed Decoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the characteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate modality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively utilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module (DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which mitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves category-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ significantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition and exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established and highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. Notably, we introduce the first benchmark GaslightingBench, specifically designed to evaluate the vulnerability of MLLMs to negation arguments. GaslightingBench consists of multiple-choice questions curated from existing datasets, along with generated negation prompts across 20 diverse categories. Throughout extensive evaluation, we find that proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation.

For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings.

Through ablation experiments across five datasets, DiagMLP achieves performance parity with state-of-the-art GNN-based methods in fault detection, localization, and classification. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that graph structures are indispensable, revealing that: (i) preprocessing pipelines already encode critical dependency information, and (ii) GNN modules contribute marginally beyond multimodality fusion.

Building on this foundation, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate LLMs with visual models to process diverse inputs, including clinical data and medical images. In ophthalmology, LLMs have been explored for analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT) reports, assisting in disease classification, and even predicting treatment outcomes. However, existing MLLM benchmarks often fail to capture the complexities of real-world clinical practice, particularly in the analysis of OCT images. Many suffer from limitations such as small sample sizes, a lack of diverse OCT datasets, and insufficient expert validation. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of MLLMs' ability to interpret OCT scans and their broader applicability in ophthalmology. Our dataset, curated through rigorous quality control and expert annotation, consists of 439 fundus images and 75 OCT images. Using a standardized API-based framework, we assessed seven mainstream MLLMs and observed significant variability in diagnostic accuracy across different diseases. While some models performed well in diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, they struggled with others, including choroidal neovascularization and myopia, highlighting inconsistencies in performance and the need for further refinement. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing clinically relevant benchmarks to provide a more accurate assessment of MLLMs' capabilities. By refining these models and expanding their scope, we can enhance their potential to transform ophthalmic diagnosis and treatment.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing MLLMs are trained on single-turn vision question-answering tasks, which do not accurately reflect real-world human conversations. In this paper, we introduce MMDiag, a multi-turn multimodal dialogue dataset. This dataset is collaboratively generated through deliberately designed rules and GPT assistance, featuring strong correlations between questions, between questions and images, and among different image regions; thus aligning more closely with real-world scenarios. MMDiag serves as a strong benchmark for multi-turn multimodal dialogue learning and brings more challenges to the grounding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Further, inspired by human vision processing, we present DiagNote, an MLLM equipped with multimodal grounding and reasoning capabilities. DiagNote consists of two modules (Deliberate and Gaze) interacting with each other to perform Chain-of-Thought and annotations respectively, throughout multi-turn dialogues. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of DiagNote in both grounding and jointly processing and reasoning with vision and language information over existing MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on inputs to maximize jailbreak probability. To counteract attacks, we also propose two defensive methods: Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF) and Jailbreak-Probability-based Defensive Noise (JPDN), which minimizes jailbreak probability in the MLLM parameters and input space, respectively. Extensive experiments show that (1) JPA yields improvements (up to 28.38\%) under both white and black box settings compared to previous methods with small perturbation bounds and few iterations. (2) JPF and JPDN significantly reduce jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.</p></details> |  |

While GPT-4 and GPT-4o demonstrated strong alignment with human evaluations and significant advancements over smaller models, qualitative analyses revealed distinct differences in processing patterns, such as multisensory overrating and reliance on loose semantic associations. Despite integrating multimodal capabilities, GPT-4o did not exhibit superior grounding compared to GPT-4, raising questions about their role in improving human-like grounding. These findings underscore how LLMs' reliance on linguistic patterns can both approximate and diverge from human embodied cognition, revealing limitations in replicating sensory experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, 15 pages</p></details> |

However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

This work takes one step in this direction. Robi Butler is a new household robot assistant that enables seamless multimodal remote interaction. It allows the human user to monitor its environment from a first-person view, issue voice or text commands, and specify target objects through hand-pointing gestures. At its core, a high-level behavior module, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), interprets multimodal instructions to generate multistep action plans. Each plan consists of open-vocabulary primitives supported by vision-language models, enabling the robot to process both textual and gestural inputs. Zoom provides a convenient interface to implement remote interactions between the human and the robot. The integration of these components allows Robi Butler to ground remote multimodal instructions in real-world home environments in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated the system on various household tasks, demonstrating its ability to execute complex user commands with multimodal inputs. We also conducted a user study to examine how multimodal interaction influences user experiences in remote human-robot interaction. These results suggest that with the advances in robot foundation models, we are moving closer to the reality of remote household robot assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment. Comprehensive experiments on two public multimodal UAV object detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal UAV object detectors.</p></details> |  |

ProBench consists of 4,000 high-quality samples independently submitted by professionals based on their daily productivity demands.

However, we find that MM-RMs trained on existing datasets often struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution data due to their reliance on unimodal spurious correlations, primarily text-only shortcuts within the training distribution, which prevents them from leveraging true multimodal reward functions. To address this, we introduce a Shortcut-aware MM-RM learning algorithm that mitigates this issue by dynamically reweighting training samples, shifting the distribution toward better multimodal understanding, and reducing dependence on unimodal spurious correlations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generalization, downstream task performance, and scalability, establishing a more robust framework for multimodal reward modeling.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce WeGen, a model that unifies multimodal generation and understanding, and promotes their interplay in iterative generation. It can generate diverse results with high creativity for less detailed instructions. And it can progressively refine prior generation results or integrating specific contents from references following the instructions in its chat with users. During this process, it is capable of preserving consistency in the parts that the user is already satisfied with. To this end, we curate a large-scale dataset, extracted from Internet videos, containing rich object dynamics and auto-labeled dynamics descriptions by advanced foundation models to date. These two information are interleaved into a single sequence to enable WeGen to learn consistency-aware generation where the specified dynamics are generated while the consistency of unspecified content is preserved aligned with instructions. Besides, we introduce a prompt self-rewriting mechanism to enhance generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of unifying multimodal understanding and generation in WeGen and show it achieves state-of-the-art performance across various visual generation benchmarks. These also demonstrate the potential of WeGen as a user-friendly design copilot as desired. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/hzphzp/WeGen.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities while maintaining strong performance when all modalities are available. Our method introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality. To efficiently learn the approximation for the missing modality via CMPTs with minimal computational overhead, we employ low-rank adapters in frozen unimodal encoders and jointly optimize an alignment loss with a task-specific loss. Extensive experiments on five multimodal datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various missing rates while achieving competitive results in complete-modality settings. Overall, our method offers a flexible and efficient solution for robust multimodal learning.

However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

This paper presents a multimodal approach to tackle these challenges on a well-known dataset. We propose a system that integrates four key modalities/channels using pre-trained models: RoBERTa for text, Wav2Vec2 for speech, a proposed FacialNet for facial expressions, and a CNN+Transformer architecture trained from scratch for video analysis. Feature embeddings from each modality are concatenated to form a multimodal vector, which is then used to predict emotion and sentiment labels. The multimodal system demonstrates superior performance compared to unimodal approaches, achieving an accuracy of 66.36% for emotion recognition and 72.15% for sentiment analysis.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, as the scale of LMMs continues to grow, fully fine-tuning these models has become highly parameter-intensive. Although Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been introduced to reduce the number of tunable parameters, a significant performance gap remains compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, existing PEFT approaches are often highly parameterized, making them difficult to interpret and control. In light of this, we introduce Multimodal Representation Tuning (MRT), a novel approach that focuses on directly editing semantically rich multimodal representations to achieve strong performance and provide intuitive control over LMMs. Empirical results show that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines with significant performance gains (e.g., 1580.40 MME score) while requiring substantially fewer tunable parameters (e.g., 0.03% parameters). Additionally, we conduct experiments on editing instrumental tokens within multimodal representations, demonstrating that direct manipulation of these representations enables simple yet effective control over network behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments.

Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves state-of-the-art rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |

We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate" algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources.

Moreover, existing urban benchmarks have been limited to evaluating LMMs with basic region-level urban tasks under singular views, leading to incomplete evaluations of LMMs' abilities in urban environments. To address these issues, we present UrBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating LMMs in complex multi-view urban scenarios. UrBench contains 11.6K meticulously curated questions at both region-level and role-level that cover 4 task dimensions: Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding, and Object Understanding, totaling 14 task types. In constructing UrBench, we utilize data from existing datasets and additionally collect data from 11 cities, creating new annotations using a cross-view detection-matching method. With these images and annotations, we then integrate LMM-based, rule-based, and human-based methods to construct large-scale high-quality questions. Our evaluations on 21 LMMs show that current LMMs struggle in the urban environments in several aspects. Even the best performing GPT-4o lags behind humans in most tasks, ranging from simple tasks such as counting to complex tasks such as orientation, localization and object attribute recognition, with an average performance gap of 17.4%. Our benchmark also reveals that LMMs exhibit inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, especially with respect to understanding cross-view relations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Existing methods often assume a unimodal distribution of the underlying transformations between images, which limits their power when data with multimodal distributions occur. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Multimodal Geometric Augmentation (MGAug), that for the first time generates augmenting transformations in a multimodal latent space of geometric deformations. To achieve this, we first develop a deep network that embeds the learning of latent geometric spaces of diffeomorphic transformations (a.k.a. diffeomorphisms) in a variational autoencoder (VAE). A mixture of multivariate Gaussians is formulated in the tangent space of diffeomorphisms and serves as a prior to approximate the hidden distribution of image transformations. We then augment the original training dataset by deforming images using randomly sampled transformations from the learned multimodal latent space of VAE. To validate the efficiency of our model, we jointly learn the augmentation strategy with two distinct domain-specific tasks: multi-class classification on 2D synthetic datasets and segmentation on real 3D brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). We also compare MGAug with state-of-the-art transformation-based image augmentation algorithms. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms all baselines by significantly improved prediction accuracy.

We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and robustness in multimodal learning tasks.

While RAG enhances MLLMs by grounding responses in query-relevant external knowledge, this reliance poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where misinformation or irrelevant knowledge is intentionally injected into external knowledge bases to manipulate model outputs to be incorrect and even harmful. To expose such vulnerabilities in multimodal RAG, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, a novel knowledge poisoning attack framework with two attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which injects query-specific misinformation in both text and images for targeted manipulation, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA) to provide false guidance during MLLM generation to elicit nonsensical responses across all queries. We evaluate our attacks across multiple tasks, models, and access settings, demonstrating that LPA successfully manipulates the MLLM to generate attacker-controlled answers, with a success rate of up to 56% on MultiModalQA. Moreover, GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single irrelevant knowledge injection. Our results highlight the urgent need for robust defenses against knowledge poisoning to safeguard multimodal RAG frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/HyeonjeongHa/MM-PoisonRAG</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

TI-JEPA combines the flexibility of EBM in self-supervised learning to facilitate the compatibility between textual and visual elements. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that TI-JEPA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment analysis task (and potentially on a wide range of multimodal-based tasks, such as Visual Question Answering), outperforming existing pre-training methodologies.

On top of this, we introduce InterFeedback-Bench which evaluates interactive intelligence using two representative datasets, MMMU-Pro and MathVerse, to test 10 different open-source LMMs. Additionally, we present InterFeedback-Human, a newly collected dataset of 120 cases designed for manually testing interactive performance in leading models such as OpenAI-o1 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Our evaluation results indicate that even the state-of-the-art LMM, OpenAI-o1, struggles to refine its responses based on human feedback, achieving an average score of less than 50%. Our findings point to the need for methods that can enhance LMMs' capabilities to interpret and benefit from feedback.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, due to the significant length of speech representations, direct integration with LLMs imposes substantial computational costs. Prior approaches address this by compressing speech representations before feeding them into LLMs. However, higher compression ratios often lead to performance degradation, necessitating a trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which enables flexible adaptation of the audio-visual token allocation based on specific computational constraints while preserving high performance. Our approach, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, encodes audio-visual representations at multiple granularities within a single model, eliminating the need to train separate models for different compression levels. Moreover, to efficiently fine-tune the LLM, we introduce three LoRA-based Matryoshka strategies using global and scale-specific LoRA modules. Extensive evaluations on the two largest AVSR datasets demonstrate that Llama-MTSK achieves state-of-the-art results, matching or surpassing models trained independently at fixed compression levels.</p></details> |  |

Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is necessary to reuse the existing ones and further extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). However, this often comes with a performance degradation in the previously learned modalities. In this work, we revisit the MCL and investigate a more severe issue it faces in contrast to traditional continual learning, that its degradation comes not only from catastrophic forgetting but also from the misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To address this problem, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA). Our method avoids introducing heavy training overhead or modifying the model architecture, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, despite the simplicity of MERA, it shows impressive performance, holding up to a 99.84% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving a nearly lossless MCL performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an integrated approach combining advanced deep learning techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for comprehensive road perception. For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%).

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce \textit{Poisoned-MRAG}, the first knowledge poisoning attack on multimodal RAG systems. Poisoned-MRAG injects a few carefully crafted image-text pairs into the multimodal knowledge database, manipulating VLMs to generate the attacker-desired response to a target query. Specifically, we formalize the attack as an optimization problem and propose two cross-modal attack strategies, dirty-label and clean-label, tailored to the attacker's knowledge and goals. Our extensive experiments across multiple knowledge databases and VLMs show that Poisoned-MRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98\% attack success rate with just five malicious image-text pairs injected into the InfoSeek database (481,782 pairs). Additionally, We evaluate 4 different defense strategies, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal, structure-driven mitigation, and purification, demonstrating their limited effectiveness and trade-offs against Poisoned-MRAG. Our results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of Poisoned-MRAG, underscoring its potential as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.</p></details> |  |

Our core idea is that different levels of reasoning abilities can be combined dynamically to tackle questions with different complexity. To this end, we propose a paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which is composed of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomenon of overthinking. To introduce structured reasoning capabilities into visual understanding models, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%.

Through controlled experiments, we compare CoT-structured and standard textual annotations across large reasoning models (LRMs) and large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation employs a dual-layer framework assessing both intermediate reasoning and final inference quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoT significantly improves 3D semantic grounding, with LRMs leveraging CoT more effectively than LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight that annotation structure influences performance-explicit reasoning markers aid LLMs, while unmarked CoT better aligns with LRM inference patterns. Our analyses suggest that CoT is crucial for enhancing multimodal reasoning, with implications beyond 3D tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although existing approaches infer gaze solely from image signals, recent advances in visual-language collaboration have demonstrated that the integration of linguistic information can significantly enhance performance across various visual tasks. Leveraging the remarkable transferability of large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, we address the open and urgent question of how to effectively apply linguistic cues to gaze estimation. In this work, we propose GazeCLIP, a novel gaze estimation framework that deeply explores text-face collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a meticulously designed linguistic description generator to produce text signals enriched with coarse directional cues. Furthermore, we present a CLIP-based backbone adept at characterizing text-face pairs for gaze estimation, complemented by a fine-grained multimodal fusion module that models the intricate interrelationships between heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GazeCLIP, which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential of using visual-language collaboration to advance gaze estimation and open new avenues for future research in multimodal learning for visual tasks.

Fine-tuning MLLMs with Federated Learning (FL) allows for expanding the training data scope by including private data sources, thereby enhancing their practical applicability in privacy-sensitive domains. However, current research remains in the early stage, particularly in addressing the \textbf{multimodal heterogeneities} in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to evaluate the performance of federated fine-tuning of MLLMs across various multimodal heterogeneous scenarios, laying the groundwork for future research in the field. Our benchmark includes two lightweight MLLMs, two downstream tasks, three evaluation metrics, and five datasets across three domains, along with six comparison baselines, covering over ten types of modality heterogeneities across four multimodal scenarios. To address the challenges posed by multimodal heterogeneity, we develop a general FedMLLM framework that integrates classic FL methods alongside two modality-agnostic strategies. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FL paradigm improves the performance of MLLMs by broadening the range of training data and mitigating multimodal heterogeneity.

However, their abilities to memorize, recall, and reason in sustained interactions within real-world scenarios remain underexplored. This paper introduces MMRC, a Multi-Modal Real-world Conversation benchmark for evaluating six core open-ended abilities of MLLMs: information extraction, multi-turn reasoning, information update, image management, memory recall, and answer refusal. With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions. We identify four common failure patterns: long-term memory degradation, inadequacies in updating factual knowledge, accumulated assumption of error propagation, and reluctance to say no. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple yet effective NOTE-TAKING strategy, which can record key information from the conversation and remind the model during its responses, enhancing conversational capabilities. Experiments across six MLLMs demonstrate significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

Most state-of-the-art detectors only yield a binary decision, incapable of forgery localization, attribution of forgery methods, and providing analysis on the cause of forgeries. In this work, we integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within DM-based face forensics, and propose a fine-grained analysis triad framework called VLForgery, that can 1) predict falsified facial images; 2) locate the falsified face regions subjected to partial synthesis; and 3) attribute the synthesis with specific generators. To achieve the above goals, we introduce VLF (Visual Language Forensics), a novel and diverse synthesis face dataset designed to facilitate rich interactions between Visual and Language modalities in MLLMs. Additionally, we propose an extrinsic knowledge-guided description method, termed EkCot, which leverages knowledge from the image generation pipeline to enable MLLMs to quickly capture image content. Furthermore, we introduce a low-level vision comparison pipeline designed to identify differential features between real and fake that MLLMs can inherently understand. These features are then incorporated into EkCot, enhancing its ability to analyze forgeries in a structured manner, following the sequence of detection, localization, and attribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLForgery outperforms other state-of-the-art forensic approaches in detection accuracy, with additional potential for falsified region localization and attribution analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and image aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring the quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A single score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How to use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS), remains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel dataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715 UGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These attributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level (e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we conduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to effectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting just two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with the learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA methods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability and show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA). The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, currently there is no straightforward and efficient framework to transfer the multimodal comprehension abilities of MLLMs to T2I models to enable them to understand multimodal inputs. In this paper, we propose the X2I framework, which endows Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models with the capability to comprehend various modalities, including multilingual text, screenshot documents, images, videos, and audio. X2I is trained using merely 100K English corpus with 160 GPU hours. Building on the DiT teacher model, we adopt an innovative distillation method to extract the inference capabilities of the teacher model and design a lightweight AlignNet structure to serve as an intermediate bridge. Compared to the teacher model, X2I shows a decrease in performance degradation of less than 1\% while gaining various multimodal understanding abilities, including multilingual to image, image to image, image-text to image, video to image, audio to image, and utilizing creative fusion to enhance imagery. Furthermore, it is applicable for LoRA training in the context of image-text to image generation, filling a void in the industry in this area. We further design a simple LightControl to enhance the fidelity of instructional image editing. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, multifunctionality, and transferability of our X2I.

MoMug integrates diffusion-based continuous motion generation with the model's inherent autoregressive discrete text prediction capabilities by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM. This enables seamless switching between continuous motion output and discrete text token prediction within a single model architecture, effectively combining the strengths of both diffusion- and LLM-based approaches. Experimental results show that, compared to the most recent LLM-based baseline, MoMug improves FID by 38% and mean accuracy across seven metrics by 16.61% on the text-to-motion task. Additionally, it improves mean accuracy across eight metrics by 8.44% on the text-to-motion task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to integrate diffusion- and LLM-based generation within a single model for motion-related multimodal tasks while maintaining low training costs. This establishes a foundation for future advancements in motion-related generation, paving the way for high-quality yet cost-efficient motion synthesis.</p></details> |  |

It belongs to a decentralized edge collaborative learning in the edge-side models that must maintain a low computational load. And only a limited amount of annotations in source domain data is provided, with most of the data being unannotated. Further, this paper proposes a vision-aware multimodal prompt tuning framework (VAMP) under the decentralized schema, where the vision-aware prompt guides the text domain-specific prompt to maintain semantic discriminability and perceive the domain information. The cross-modal semantic and domain distribution alignment losses optimize each edge-side model, while text classifier consistency and semantic diversity losses promote collaborative learning among edge-side models. Extensive experiments were conducted on OfficeHome and DomainNet datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VAMP in the UMFDA, which outperformed the previous prompt tuning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on arbitrary design choices, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we systematically investigate two core aspects of multi-layer visual feature fusion: (1) selecting the most effective visual layers and (2) identifying the best fusion approach with the language model. Our experiments reveal that while combining visual features from multiple stages improves generalization, incorporating additional features from the same stage typically leads to diminished performance. Furthermore, we find that direct fusion of multi-layer visual features at the input stage consistently yields superior and more stable performance across various configurations.

It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

In our deployment process, we observe that existing MLLMs often face performance degradation on pure language tasks, and the current NPU platforms on smartphones do not support the MoE architecture, which is commonly used to preserve pure language capabilities during multimodal training. To address these issues, we systematically analyze methods to maintain pure language capabilities during the training of MLLMs, focusing on both training data and model architecture aspects. Based on these analyses, we propose GenieBlue, an efficient MLLM structural design that integrates both linguistic and multimodal capabilities for LLMs on mobile devices. GenieBlue freezes the original LLM parameters during MLLM training to maintain pure language capabilities. It acquires multimodal capabilities by duplicating specific transformer blocks for full fine-tuning and integrating lightweight LoRA modules. This approach preserves language capabilities while achieving comparable multimodal performance through extensive training. Deployed on smartphone NPUs, GenieBlue demonstrates efficiency and practicality for applications on mobile devices.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While previous studies have explored quantization as an efficient post-training compression method for Large Language Models (LLMs), low-bit compression for multimodal models remains under-explored. The redundant nature of inputs in multimodal models results in a highly sparse attention matrix. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the attention matrix's sparsity bounds the compression error of the Query and Key weight matrices. Based on this, we introduce CASP, a model compression technique for LMMs. Our approach performs a data-aware low-rank decomposition on the Query and Key weight matrix, followed by quantization across all layers based on an optimal bit allocation process. CASP is compatible with any quantization technique and enhances state-of-the-art 2-bit quantization methods (AQLM and QuIP#) by an average of 21% on image- and video-language benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

After evaluation on a small multimodal pneumonia dataset, FMT achieved state-of-the-art performance with 94% accuracy, 95% recall, and 93% F1 score, outperforming single-modal baselines (ResNet: 89%; BERT: 79%) and the medical benchmark CheXMed (90%), providing a scalable solution for multimodal diagnosis of pneumonia in resource-constrained medical settings.</p></details> |  |

PoSSUM leverages users' real-time posts, images, and other digital traces to create silicon samples that capture information not present in the LLM's training data. To obtain representative estimates, PoSSUM employs Multilevel Regression and Post-Stratification (MrP) with structured priors to counteract the observable selection biases of social-media platforms. The protocol is validated during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, for which five PoSSUM polls were conducted and published on GitHub and X. In the final poll, fielded October 17-26 with a synthetic sample of 1,054 X users, PoSSUM accurately predicted the outcomes in 50 of 51 states and assigned the Republican candidate a win probability of 0.65. Notably, it also exhibited lower state-level bias than most established pollsters. These results demonstrate PoSSUM's potential as a fully automated, unobtrusive alternative to traditional survey methods.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D trackers, yielding substantial performance gains.

Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI.

| **[Robust Multimodal Learning for Ophthalmic Disease Grading via Disentangled Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05319v1)** | 2025-03-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.05319v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 10pages |

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p></details> | 39 pages |

A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |

Chronic wounds are difficult and costly to treat, and have become a serious burden on health care systems worldwide. Chronic wounds can have devastating consequences for the patient, with infection often leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk. Innovative deep learning methods for the detection and monitoring of such wounds have the potential to reduce the impact to both patient and clinician. We present a novel multimodal segmentation method which allows for the introduction of patient metadata into the training workflow whereby the patient data are expressed as Gaussian random fields. Our results indicate that the proposed method improved performance when utilising multiple models, each trained on different metadata categories. Using the Diabetic Foot Ulcer Challenge 2022 test set, when compared to the baseline results (intersection over union = 0.4670, Dice similarity coefficient = 0.5908) we demonstrate improvements of +0.0220 and +0.0229 for intersection over union and Dice similarity coefficient respectively. This paper presents the first study to focus on integrating patient data into a chronic wound segmentation workflow. Our results show significant performance gains when training individual models using specific metadata categories, followed by average merging of prediction masks using distance transforms.

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint.

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
