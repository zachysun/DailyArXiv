| **[Unlocking the Power of LSTM for Long Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10006v2)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.10006v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recurrent neural network architectures, such as long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), have historically held a prominent role in time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. While the recently introduced sLSTM for Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduces exponential gating and memory mixing that are beneficial for long term sequential learning, its potential short memory issue is a barrier to applying sLSTM directly in TSF. To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm named P-sLSTM, which is built upon sLSTM by incorporating patching and channel independence. These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications for our design, and conduct extensive comparative and analytical experiments to fully validate the efficiency and superior performance of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17341v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17341v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data: Challenges, Current Progress, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17119v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17119v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, generative models have achieved remarkable performance across diverse applications, including image generation, text synthesis, audio creation, video generation, and data augmentation. Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}. Assuming readers possess foundational knowledge of statistics and diffusion models, we employ mathematical formulations to deliver a rigorous and detailed review, aiming to promote developments in this emerging and exciting area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Projections and Natural Sparsity in Time-Series Classification: A Theoretical Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17061v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17061v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series classification is essential across diverse domains, including medical diagnosis, industrial monitoring, financial forecasting, and human activity recognition. The Rocket algorithm has emerged as a simple yet powerful method, achieving state-of-the-art performance through random convolutional kernels applied to time-series data, followed by non-linear transformation. Its architecture approximates a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network while eliminating parameter training, ensuring computational efficiency. Despite its empirical success, fundamental questions about its theoretical foundations remain unexplored. We bridge theory and practice by formalizing Rocket's random convolutional filters within the compressed sensing framework, proving that random projections preserve discriminative patterns in time-series data. This analysis reveals relationships between kernel parameters and input signal characteristics, enabling more principled approaches to algorithm configuration. Moreover, we demonstrate that its non-linearity, based on the proportion of positive values after convolutions, expresses the inherent sparsity of time-series data. Our theoretical investigation also proves that Rocket satisfies two critical conditions: translation invariance and noise robustness. These findings enhance interpretability and provide guidance for parameter optimization in extreme cases, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical application of time-series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabulaTime: A Novel Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Advancing Acute Coronary Syndrome Prediction through Environmental and Clinical Data Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17049v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17049v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI), remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging. We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors. Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17022v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contributed the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we identify important class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Load Forecasting for Integrated Energy Systems: A Large Language Model-based Framework with Multi-task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16896v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16896v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has increased the complexity and uncertainty of load forecasting, especially for integrated energy systems with multiple energy carriers. Traditional forecasting methods heavily rely on historical data and exhibit limited transferability across different scenarios, posing significant challenges for emerging applications in smart grids and energy internet. This paper proposes the TSLLM-Load Forecasting Mechanism, a novel zero-shot load forecasting framework based on large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges. The framework consists of three key components: a data preprocessing module that handles multi-source energy load data, a time series prompt generation module that bridges the semantic gap between energy data and LLMs through multi-task learning and similarity alignment, and a prediction module that leverages pre-trained LLMs for accurate forecasting. The framework's effectiveness was validated on a real-world dataset comprising load profiles from 20 Australian solar-powered households, demonstrating superior performance in both conventional and zero-shot scenarios. In conventional testing, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.4163 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3760, outperforming existing approaches by at least 8\%. In zero-shot prediction experiments across 19 households, the framework maintained consistent accuracy with a total MSE of 11.2712 and MAE of 7.6709, showing at least 12\% improvement over current methods. The results validate the framework's potential for accurate and transferable load forecasting in integrated energy systems, particularly beneficial for renewable energy integration and smart grid applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReFocus: Reinforcing Mid-Frequency and Key-Frequency Modeling for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16890v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16890v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have progressively incorporated frequency-based techniques into deep learning models, leading to notable improvements in accuracy and efficiency for time series analysis tasks. However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v3)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.17159v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[RhythmMamba: Fast, Lightweight, and Accurate Remote Physiological Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06483v2)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2404.06483v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a method for non-contact measurement of physiological signals from facial videos, holding great potential in various applications such as healthcare, affective computing, and anti-spoofing. Existing deep learning methods struggle to address two core issues of rPPG simultaneously: understanding the periodic pattern of rPPG among long contexts and addressing large spatiotemporal redundancy in video segments. These represent a trade-off between computational complexity and the ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce RhythmMamba, a state space model-based method that captures long-range dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. By viewing rPPG as a time series task through the proposed frame stem, the periodic variations in pulse waves are modeled as state transitions. Additionally, we design multi-temporal constraint and frequency domain feed-forward, both aligned with the characteristics of rPPG time series, to improve the learning capacity of Mamba for rPPG signals. Extensive experiments show that RhythmMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with 319% throughput and 23% peak GPU memory.

| **[A Novel Multi-Task Teacher-Student Architecture with Self-Supervised Pretraining for 48-Hour Vasoactive-Inotropic Trend Analysis in Sepsis Mortality Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16834v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16834v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sepsis is a major cause of ICU mortality, where early recognition and effective interventions are essential for improving patient outcomes. However, the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) varies dynamically with a patient's hemodynamic status, complicated by irregular medication patterns, missing data, and confounders, making sepsis prediction challenging. To address this, we propose a novel Teacher-Student multitask framework with self-supervised VIS pretraining via a Masked Autoencoder (MAE). The teacher model performs mortality classification and severity-score regression, while the student distills robust time-series representations, enhancing adaptation to heterogeneous VIS data. Compared to LSTM-based methods, our approach achieves an AUROC of 0.82 on MIMIC-IV 3.0 (9,476 patients), outperforming the baseline (0.74). SHAP analysis revealed that SOFA score (0.147) had the greatest impact on ICU mortality, followed by LODS (0.033), single marital status (0.031), and Medicaid insurance (0.023), highlighting the role of sociodemographic factors. SAPSII (0.020) also contributed significantly. These findings suggest that both clinical and social factors should be considered in ICU decision-making. Our novel multitask and distillation strategies enable earlier identification of high-risk patients, improving prediction accuracy and disease management, offering new tools for ICU decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Domain Adaptation via Latent Invariant Causal Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16637v1)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16637v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series domain adaptation aims to transfer the complex temporal dependence from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recent advances leverage the stable causal mechanism over observed variables to model the domain-invariant temporal dependence. However, modeling precise causal structures in high-dimensional data, such as videos, remains challenging. Additionally, direct causal edges may not exist among observed variables (e.g., pixels). These limitations hinder the applicability of existing approaches to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we find that the high-dimension time series data are generated from the low-dimension latent variables, which motivates us to model the causal mechanisms of the temporal latent process. Based on this intuition, we propose a latent causal mechanism identification framework that guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstructed latent causal structures. Specifically, we first identify latent variables by utilizing sufficient changes in historical information. Moreover, by enforcing the sparsity of the relationships of latent variables, we can achieve identifiable latent causal structures. Built on the theoretical results, we develop the Latent Causality Alignment (LCA) model that leverages variational inference, which incorporates an intra-domain latent sparsity constraint for latent structure reconstruction and an inter-domain latent sparsity constraint for domain-invariant structure reconstruction. Experiment results on eight benchmarks show a general improvement in the domain-adaptive time series classification and forecasting tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/LCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Transformer Inference: Optimization Strategies for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16627v1)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16627v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. This paper presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 1.63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. These findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Bad Goods Risk Scores with ARIMA Time Series: A Novel Risk Assessment Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16520v1)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16520v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of supply chains and the rising costs associated with defective or substandard goods (bad goods) highlight the urgent need for advanced predictive methodologies to mitigate risks and enhance operational efficiency. This research presents a novel framework that integrates Time Series ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models with a proprietary formula specifically designed to calculate bad goods after time series forecasting. By leveraging historical data patterns, including sales, returns, and capacity, the model forecasts potential quality failures, enabling proactive decision-making. ARIMA is employed to capture temporal trends in time series data, while the newly developed formula quantifies the likelihood and impact of defects with greater precision. Experimental results, validated on a dataset spanning 2022-2024 for Organic Beer-G 1 Liter, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional statistical models, such as Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters, in both prediction accuracy and risk evaluation. This study advances the field of predictive analytics by bridging time series forecasting, ARIMA, and risk management in supply chain quality control, offering a scalable and practical solution for minimizing losses due to bad goods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Denoising Meets Polynomial Modeling: A Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v5)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.13253v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting models are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their critical role in decision-making across various domains. However, most existing approaches represent the coupled temporal patterns, often neglecting the distinction between its specific components. In particular, fluctuating patterns and smooth trends within time series exhibit distinct characteristics. In this work, to model complicated temporal patterns, we propose a Conditional Denoising Polynomial Modeling (CDPM) framework, where probabilistic diffusion models and deterministic linear models are trained end-to-end. Instead of modeling the coupled time series, CDPM decomposes it into trend and seasonal components for modeling them separately. To capture the fluctuating seasonal component, we employ a probabilistic diffusion model based on statistical properties from the historical window. For the smooth trend component, a module is proposed to enhance linear models by incorporating historical dependencies, thereby preserving underlying trends and mitigating noise distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the potential of combining probabilistic and deterministic models. Our code is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/FDF.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Multi-Factor Network with Dynamic Sequence Modeling for Early Warning of Intraoperative Hypotension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11064v2)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.11064v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) prediction using past physiological signals is crucial, as IOH can lead to inadequate organ perfusion, increasing the risk of severe complications and mortality. However, existing IOH prediction methods often rely on static modeling, overlooking the complex temporal dependencies and non-stationary nature of physiological signals. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Multi-Factor (HMF) network that models IOH prediction as a dynamic sequence forecasting problem, explicitly capturing temporal dependencies and physiological non-stationarity.. Specifically, we formalize physiological signal dynamics as a sequence of multivariate time series, and decompose them into trend and seasonal components, enabling distinct modeling of long-term and periodic variations. For each component, we employ a patch-based Transformer encoder to extract representative features with the concern of computational efficiency and representation quality. Furthermore, to mitigate distributional drift arising from the evolving signals, we introduce a symmetric normalization mechanism. Extensive experiments on both a publicly available dataset and a private dataset collected from real-world hospital settings demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines. We hope HMF offers a new perspective on IOH prediction and further enhances surgical safety. Our code is open-sourced and available at \footnote{https://github.com/Mingyue-Cheng/HMF}.</p></details> |  |

However, limited data availability during emerging outbreaks and the complex interaction between environmental factors and disease dynamics present significant challenges for effective forecasting. In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

High-precision forecasting of EV charging demand is crucial for efficient station management, to address some of these challenges. This paper presents an approach to predict the charging demand at 15-minute intervals for the day ahead using a multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism. Additionally, the model leverages explainable AI techniques to evaluate the influence of various factors on the predictions, including weather conditions, day of the week, month, and any holiday. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used to quantify the contribution of each feature to the final forecast, providing deeper insights into how these factors affect prediction accuracy. As a result, the framework offers enhanced decision-making for infrastructure planning. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations using the test data collected from the EV charging stations at California State University, Long Beach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented in the 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Time Warping for Multiple Time Series Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16324v1)** | 2025-02-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16324v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Alignment is a critical task in signal processing with numerous real-world applications. In practice, signals often exhibit temporal shifts and scaling, making classification on raw data prone to errors. This paper introduces a novel approach for Multiple Time Series Alignment (MTSA) leveraging Deep Learning techniques. While most existing methods primarily address Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for protein and DNA sequences, there remains a significant gap in alignment methodologies for numerical time series. Additionally, conventional approaches typically focus on pairwise alignment, whereas our proposed method aligns all signals in a multiple manner (all the signals are aligned together at once). This innovation not only enhances alignment efficiency but also significantly improves computational speed. By decomposing into piece-wise linear sections, we introduce varying levels of complexity into the warping function. Additionally, our method ensures the satisfaction of three warping constraints: boundary, monotonicity, and continuity conditions. The utilization of a deep convolutional network allows us to employ a new loss function, addressing some limitations of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Experimental results on the UCR Archive 2018, comprising 129 time series datasets, demonstrate that employing our approach to align signals significantly enhances classification accuracy and warping average and also reduces the run time across the majority of these datasets.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we propose a novel training scheme and a transformer-based architecture, collectively referred to as TimePFN, for multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting. TimePFN is based on the concept of Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFN), which aims to approximate Bayesian inference. Our approach consists of (1) generating synthetic MTS data through diverse Gaussian process kernels and the linear coregionalization method, and (2) a novel MTS architecture capable of utilizing both temporal and cross-channel dependencies across all input patches. We evaluate TimePFN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models for MTS forecasting in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, fine-tuning TimePFN with as few as 500 data points nearly matches full dataset training error, and even 50 data points yield competitive results. We also find that TimePFN exhibits strong univariate forecasting performance, attesting to its generalization ability. Overall, this work unlocks the power of synthetic data priors for MTS forecasting and facilitates strong zero- and few-shot forecasting performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI-2025 as a conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Amplifier: Bringing Attention to Neglected Low-Energy Components in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17216v3)** | 2025-02-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.17216v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an energy amplification technique to address the issue that existing models easily overlook low-energy components in time series forecasting. This technique comprises an energy amplification block and an energy restoration block. The energy amplification block enhances the energy of low-energy components to improve the model's learning efficiency for these components, while the energy restoration block returns the energy to its original level. Moreover, considering that the energy-amplified data typically displays two distinct energy peaks in the frequency spectrum, we integrate the energy amplification technique with a seasonal-trend forecaster to model the temporal relationships of these two peaks independently, serving as the backbone for our proposed model, Amplifier. Additionally, we propose a semi-channel interaction temporal relationship enhancement block for Amplifier, which enhances the model's ability to capture temporal relationships from the perspective of the commonality and specificity of each channel in the data. Extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks consistently demonstrate our model's superiority in both effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This paper introduces a novel approach to soft coherency in hierarchical time series forecasting using neural networks. We present a network coherency regularization method, which we denote as CoRe (Coherency Regularization), a technique that trains neural networks to produce forecasts that are inherently coherent across hierarchies, without strictly enforcing aggregation constraints. Our method offers several key advantages. (1) It provides theoretical guarantees on the coherency of forecasts, even for out-of-sample data. (2) It is adaptable to scenarios where data may contain errors or missing values, making it more robust than strict coherency methods. (3) It can be easily integrated into existing neural network architectures for time series forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, comparing it against state-of-the-art methods in both coherent and noisy data scenarios. Additionally, our method can be used within existing generative probabilistic forecasting frameworks to generate coherent probabilistic forecasts. Our results show improved generalization and forecast accuracy, particularly in the presence of data inconsistencies. On a variety of datasets, including both strictly hierarchically coherent and noisy data, our training method has either equal or better accuracy at all levels of the hierarchy while being strictly more coherent out-of-sample than existing soft-coherency methods.</p></details> |  |

From a security standpoint, this is particularly important because OOD test data can result in misleadingly confident yet erroneous predictions, which undermine the reliability of the deployed model. Although numerous models for OOD detection have been developed in computer vision and language, their adaptability to the time-series data domain remains limited and under-explored. Yet, time-series data is ubiquitous across manufacturing and security applications for which OOD is essential. This paper seeks to address this research gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of modality-agnostic OOD detection algorithms. We evaluate over several multivariate time-series datasets, deep learning architectures, time-series specific data augmentations, and loss functions. Our results demonstrate that: 1) the majority of state-of-the-art OOD methods exhibit limited performance on time-series data, and 2) OOD methods based on deep feature modeling may offer greater advantages for time-series OOD detection, highlighting a promising direction for future time-series OOD detection algorithm development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for an oral presentation at AAAI-25 AI4TS</p></details> |

This monograph aims to explain the success of these methods, both in theory, for which we cover foundational nonasymptotic statistical guarantees on nearest-neighbor-based regression and classification, and in practice, for which we gather prominent methods for approximate nearest neighbor search that have been essential to scaling prediction systems reliant on nearest neighbor analysis to handle massive datasets. Furthermore, we discuss connections to learning distances for use with nearest neighbor methods, including how random decision trees and ensemble methods learn nearest neighbor structure, as well as recent developments in crowdsourcing and graphons. In terms of theory, our focus is on nonasymptotic statistical guarantees, which we state in the form of how many training data and what algorithm parameters ensure that a nearest neighbor prediction method achieves a user-specified error tolerance. We begin with the most general of such results for nearest neighbor and related kernel regression and classification in general metric spaces. In such settings in which we assume very little structure, what enables successful prediction is smoothness in the function being estimated for regression, and a low probability of landing near the decision boundary for classification. In practice, these conditions could be difficult to verify for a real dataset. We then cover recent guarantees on nearest neighbor prediction in the three case studies of time series forecasting, recommending products to people over time, and delineating human organs in medical images by looking at image patches. In these case studies, clustering structure enables successful prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally published on May 31, 2018 in Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning; this revised version fixes some proof details for k-NN and fixed-radius NN regression and classification</p></details> |

Our experimental results show that Mantis outperforms existing foundation models both when the backbone is frozen and when fine-tuned, while achieving the lowest calibration error. In addition, we propose several adapters to handle the multivariate setting, reducing memory requirements and modeling channel interdependence.</p></details> |  |

We provide theoretical consistency guarantees for the MLE under mild assumptions. SpinSVAR is efficient: it can leverage GPU acceleration to scale to thousands of nodes. On synthetic data with Laplacian or Bernoulli-uniform inputs, SpinSVAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and runtime. When applied to S&P 500 data, it clusters stocks by sectors and identifies significant structural shocks linked to major price movements, demonstrating the viability of our sparse input assumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 11 figures, conference preprint</p></details> |

Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose TimeDART, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models.

Unlike the generalized eigenanalysis-based method of Chang et al.(2023) for which the convergence rates may suffer from small eigengaps as the asymptotic theory is based on some matrix perturbation analysis, the proposed new method enjoys faster convergence rates which are free from any eigengaps. It achieves this by turning the problem into a joint diagonalization of several matrices whose elements are determined by a basis of a linear system, and by choosing the basis carefully to avoid near co-linearity (see Proposition 5 and Section 4.3 below). Furthermore, unlike Chang et al.(2023) which requires the two factor loading matrices to be full-ranked, the new method can handle rank-deficient factor loading matrices.

Our approach, Jumbo, creates a wider CLS token, which is split to match the patch token width before attention, processed with self-attention, and reassembled. After attention, Jumbo applies a dedicated, wider FFN to this token. Jumbo significantly improves over ViT+Registers on ImageNet-1K at high speeds (by 3.2% for ViT-tiny and 13.5% for ViT-nano); these Jumbo models even outperform specialized compute-efficient models while preserving the architectural advantages of plain ViTs. Although Jumbo sees no gains for ViT-small on ImageNet-1K, it gains 3.4% on ImageNet-21K over ViT+Registers. Both findings indicate that Jumbo is most helpful when the ViT is otherwise too narrow for the task. Finally, we show that Jumbo can be easily adapted to excel on data beyond images, e.g., time series.</p></details> |  |

Based on this observation, we introduce TimeDistill, a cross-architecture KD framework that transfers these patterns from teacher models (e.g., Transformers, CNNs) to MLP. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that our KD approach can be interpreted as a specialized form of mixup data augmentation. TimeDistill improves MLP performance by up to 18.6%, surpassing teacher models on eight datasets. It also achieves up to 7X faster inference and requires 130X fewer parameters.

Our mechanism leverages the conditional information in each expert's running performance to forecast the best combination of LLMs for predicting the time series in its next step. Diverging from static (learned) Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods, our approach employs time-adaptive stochastic filtering techniques to combine experts. By framing the expert selection problem as a finite state-space, continuous-time Hidden Markov model (HMM), we can leverage the Wohman-Shiryaev filter. Our approach first constructs N parallel filters corresponding to each of the $N$ individual LLMs. Each filter proposes its best combination of LLMs, given the information that they have access to. Subsequently, the N filter outputs are optimally aggregated to maximize their robust predictive power, and this update is computed efficiently via a closed-form expression, generating our ensemble predictor.

Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the representation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the time-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data, and the forecasting fine-tuning stage for downstream time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves the highest rank in few-shot scenarios. In addition, evaluations compared with different unsupervised representation learning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation learning in forecasting tasks. Ablation studies further validate each component's contribution to LLM4TS and underscore the essential role of utilizing LLM's pre-trained weights for optimal performance.

| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.15842v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In this study, we demonstrate that the conventional practice of estimating models locally in data-scarce environments may underlie the mixed empirical performance observed in prior work. By focusing on volatility forecasting, we employ a dataset comprising over 10,000 global stocks and implement a global estimation strategy that pools information across cross-sections. Our econometric analysis reveals that forecasting accuracy improves markedly as the training dataset becomes larger and more heterogeneous. Notably, even with as little as 12 months of data, globally trained networks deliver robust predictions for individual stocks and portfolios that are not even in the training dataset. Furthermore, our interpretation of the model dynamics shows that these networks not only capture key stylized facts of volatility but also exhibit resilience to outliers and rapid adaptation to market regime changes. These findings underscore the importance of leveraging extensive and diverse datasets in financial forecasting and advocate for a shift from traditional local training approaches to integrated global estimation methods.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in widespread and prolonged conflicts. Here we present a scalable method for estimating building damage resulting from armed conflicts. By training a machine learning model on Synthetic Aperture Radar image time series, we generate probabilistic damage estimates at the building level, leveraging existing damage assessments and open building footprints. To allow large-scale inference and ensure accessibility, we tie our method to run on Google Earth Engine. Users can adjust confidence intervals to suit their needs, enabling rapid and flexible assessments of war-related damage across large areas. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our precomputed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to run our method and generate custom maps.</p></details> |  |

In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

When a process generates multiple synchronized signals we are faced with multidimensional time series. In this context a fundamental problem is that of motif mining, where we seek patterns repeating twice with minor variations, spanning some of the dimensions. State of the art exact solutions for this problem run in time quadratic in the length of the input time series. We provide a scalable method to find the top-k motifs in multidimensional time series with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the results. Our algorithm runs in time subquadratic in the length of the input, and returns the exact solution with probability at least $1-\delta$, where $\delta$ is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive to the input distribution, self-tuning its parameters while respecting user-defined limits on the memory to use. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by an extensive experimental evaluation, showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.</p></details> | work in progress |

Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</p></details> |  |

We formulate these problems as generative-adversarial (i.e., min-max) optimization problems, for which we develop polynomial-time algorithms to solve, the former of which relies on an exact first-order oracle, and the latter, a stochastic one. We extend our approach to solve inverse multiagent simulacral learning in polynomial time and number of samples. In these problems, we seek a simulacrum, meaning parameters and an associated equilibrium that replicate the given observations in expectation. We find that our approach outperforms the widely-used ARIMA method in predicting prices in Spanish electricity markets based on time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was submitted to the International Conference on Learning Representations (2024) under the title of "Generative Adversarial Inverse Multiagent Learning", and renamed for the camera-ready submission as "Efficient Inverse Multiagent Learning"</p></details> |

We explore whether these capabilities can be extended to continuous vectors from diverse domains, obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. By aligning input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors, we observe that LLMs can effectively process and learn from these projected vectors, which we term Vector-ICL. In particular, we find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. In our experiments across various tasks and modalities, including text reconstruction, numerical function regression, text classification, summarization, molecule captioning, time-series classification, graph classification, and fMRI decoding, Vector-ICL often surpasses both few-shot ICL and domain-specific model or tuning. We further conduct analyses and case studies, indicating the potential of LLMs to process vector representations beyond traditional token-based paradigms.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge. Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |

However, this rapid progression raises concerns regarding inconsistent benchmarking and reporting practices, which may undermine the reliability of these comparisons. Our position emphasizes the need to shift focus away from pursuing ever-more complex models and towards enhancing benchmarking practices through rigorous and standardized evaluation methods. To support our claim, we first perform a broad, thorough, and reproducible evaluation of the top-performing models on the most popular benchmark by training 3,500+ networks over 14 datasets. Then, through a comprehensive analysis, we find that slight changes to experimental setups or current evaluation metrics drastically shift the common belief that newly published results are advancing the state of the art. Our findings suggest the need for rigorous and standardized evaluation methods that enable more substantiated claims, including reproducible hyperparameter setups and statistical testing.</p></details> | Pre-print |

However, existing causal discovery methods often assume stationarity, limiting their effectiveness when time series consist of sequential regimes, consecutive temporal segments with unknown boundaries and changing causal structures. In this work, we firstly introduce a framework to describe and model such time series. Then, we present CASTOR, a novel method that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each regime while determining the number of regimes and their sequential arrangement. CASTOR optimizes the data log-likelihood using an expectation-maximization algorithm, alternating between assigning regime indices (expectation step) and inferring causal relationships in each regime (maximization step). We establish the identifiability of the regimes and DAGs within our framework. Extensive experiments show that CASTOR consistently outperforms existing causal discovery models in detecting different regimes and learning their DAGs across various settings, including linear and nonlinear causal relationships, on both synthetic and real world datasets.</p></details> |  |

We develop an analytic framework for this scenario based on a reduction to online learning with delayed feedback. In particular, we show that the existence of an online learning algorithm with bounded regret (against a fixed statistical learning algorithm in a specially constructed game of online learning with delayed feedback) implies low generalization error of said statistical learning method even if the data sequence is sampled from a mixing time series. The rates demonstrate a trade-off between the amount of delay in the online learning game and the degree of dependence between consecutive data points, with near-optimal rates recovered in a number of well-studied settings when the delay is tuned appropriately as a function of the mixing time of the process.</p></details> |  |

The LSTM component adeptly captures temporal patterns in stock price data, effectively modeling the time series dynamics of financial markets. Concurrently, the GNN component leverages Pearson correlation and association analysis to model inter-stock relational data, capturing complex nonlinear polyadic dependencies influencing stock prices. The model is trained and evaluated using an expanding window validation approach, enabling continuous learning from increasing amounts of data and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on historical stock data demonstrate that our hybrid LSTM-GNN model achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.00144, representing a substantial reduction of 10.6% compared to the MSE of the standalone LSTM model of 0.00161. Furthermore, the hybrid model outperforms traditional and advanced benchmarks, including linear regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and dense networks. These compelling results underscore the significant potential of combining temporal and relational data through a hybrid approach, offering a powerful tool for real-time trading and financial analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in personalized education remains limited due to an overemphasis on correctness over error diagnosis and feedback generation. Current models fail to provide meaningful insights into the causes of student mistakes, limiting their utility in educational contexts. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions. First, we introduce \textbf{MathCCS} (Mathematical Classification and Constructive Suggestions), a multi-modal benchmark designed for systematic error analysis and tailored feedback. MathCCS includes real-world problems, expert-annotated error categories, and longitudinal student data. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models, including \textit{Qwen2-VL}, \textit{LLaVA-OV}, \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} and \textit{GPT-4o}, reveal that none achieved classification accuracy above 30\% or generated high-quality suggestions (average scores below 4/10), highlighting a significant gap from human-level performance. Second, we develop a sequential error analysis framework that leverages historical data to track trends and improve diagnostic precision. Finally, we propose a multi-agent collaborative framework that combines a Time Series Agent for historical analysis and an MLLM Agent for real-time refinement, enhancing error classification and feedback generation. Together, these contributions provide a robust platform for advancing personalized education, bridging the gap between current AI capabilities and the demands of real-world teaching.</p></details> |  |

While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. A series of recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the current literature have yet striked a high-quality balance between (a) effectively aligning the time series and natural language modalities, and (b) keeping the inference efficiency. To address the above issues, we now propose the Time-LlaMA framework. Time-LlaMA first converts the time series input into token embeddings through a linear tokenization mechanism. Second, the time series token embeddings are aligned with the text prompts. Third, to further adapt the LLM backbone for time series modeling, we have developed a dynamic low-rank adaptation technique (D-LoRA). D-LoRA dynamically chooses the most suitable LoRA modules at each layer of the Transformer backbone for each time series input, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. Our experimental results on an extensive collection of challenging real-world time series tasks confirm that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

Our framework introduces a differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) method, AB-DARTS, which improves upon existing DNAS approaches by enhancing the identification of optimal operations within the architecture. AutoFormer-TS systematically explores alternative attention mechanisms, activation functions, and encoding operations, moving beyond the traditional Transformer design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoFormer-TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various TSP benchmarks, achieving superior forecasting accuracy while maintaining reasonable training efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the memory requirement for backpropagation scales linearly with the number of layers, which leads to memory bottlenecks during training. Moreover, deep networks are often unable to handle time-series data appearing at irregular intervals. These issues can be resolved by considering continuous-depth networks based on the neural ODE framework in combination with reversible integration methods that allow for variable time-steps. Reversibility of the method ensures that the memory requirement for training is independent of network depth, while variable time-steps are required for assimilating time-series data on irregular intervals. However, at present, there are no known higher-order reversible methods with this property. High-order methods are especially important when a high level of accuracy in learning is required or when small time-steps are necessary due to large errors in time integration of neural ODEs, for instance in context of complex dynamical systems such as Kepler systems and molecular dynamics. The requirement of small time-steps when using a low-order method can significantly increase the computational cost of training as well as inference. In this work, we present an approach for constructing high-order reversible methods that allow adaptive time-stepping. Our numerical tests show the advantages in computational speed when applied to the task of learning dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data such as lab test results capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative embeddings. These embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We also provide VinDigitizer, a digitization baseline to convert paper-based ECGs into digital time-series signals. The method involves detecting signal rows, extracting waveforms from the background, and reconstructing numerical values from the digitized traces. We applied VinDigitizer to 549 scanned ECGs and evaluated its performance against the original PTB dataset (modified to match the printed signals). The results achieved a mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0.01 dB, highlighting both the feasibility and challenges of ECG digitization, particularly in mitigating distortions from printing and scanning processes. By providing PTB-Image and baseline digitization methods, this work aims to facilitate advancements in ECG digitization, enhancing access to historical ECG data and supporting applications in telemedicine and automated cardiac diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,074 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 45.7% in reposts, 43.5% in likes, 22.9% in replies, and 14.0% in views after being attached. Over the posts' entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.4% fewer reposts, 13.0% fewer likes, 7.3% fewer replies, and 5.7% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep, but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a study on using supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) to predict key attributes and tactics of swarming autonomous agents for military contexts. Specifically, NN TSC is applied to infer two binary attributes - communication and proportional navigation - which combine to define four mutually exclusive swarm tactics. We identify a gap in literature on using NNs for swarm classification and demonstrate the effectiveness of NN TSC in rapidly deducing intelligence about attacking swarms to inform counter-maneuvers. Through simulated swarm-vs-swarm engagements, we evaluate NN TSC performance in terms of observation window requirements, noise robustness, and scalability to swarm size. Key findings show NNs can predict swarm behaviors with 97% accuracy using short observation windows of 20 time steps, while also demonstrating graceful degradation down to 80% accuracy under 50% noise, as well as excellent scalability to swarm sizes from 10 to 100 agents. These capabilities are promising for real-time decision-making support in defense scenarios by rapidly inferring insights about swarm behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article published in IEEE TAES.

| **[VUS: Effective and Efficient Accuracy Measures for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13318v1)** | 2025-02-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.13318v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In contrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies (i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also concerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple observations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based information retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to assess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each point as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous data introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of range-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may significantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of attention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper extensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their robustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality ratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values independently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for time-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based measures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family of parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, Volume Under the Surface (VUS), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. We also introduce two optimized implementations for VUS that reduce significantly the execution time of the initial implementation. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures are significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD methods.</p></details> |  |

A prominent drawback of existing solutions lies in their limited interpretability, often confined to presenting users with centroids. In addressing this gap, our work presents $k$-Graph, an unsupervised method explicitly crafted to augment interpretability in time series clustering. Leveraging a graph representation of time series subsequences, $k$-Graph constructs multiple graph representations based on different subsequence lengths. This feature accommodates variable-length time series without requiring users to predetermine subsequence lengths. Our experimental results reveal that $k$-Graph outperforms current state-of-the-art time series clustering algorithms in accuracy, while providing users with meaningful explanations and interpretations of the clustering outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This approach aims to leverage better feature relations by considering the data as coming from different modalities. These data are projected into a shared lower-dimensionality subspace which aims to preserve their inner characteristics. To supplement the previous work on this subject, we introduce novel multimodal graph-embedded regularizers that leverage graph information for every modality to enhance the training process, and we consider an improved training equation that allows us to maximize or minimize each modality according to the specified criteria. We apply this regularized graph-embedded model on a 3-modalities dataset after having generalized MS-SVDD algorithms to any number of modalities. To set up our application, we propose a whole preprocessing procedure to extract One-Class Classification training instances from time-bounded event time series that are used to evaluate both the reliability and earliness of our model for Event Detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, supplementary material</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in deep learning, the theoretical understanding of how and why complex architectures function remains limited, prompting the need for more interpretable models. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as a more interpretable alternative. While KAN-related research is significantly rising, to date, the study of KAN architectures for time series classification has been limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive and robust exploration of the KAN architecture for time series classification on the UCR benchmark. More specifically, we look at a) how reference architectures for forecasting transfer to classification, at the b) hyperparameter and implementation influence on the classification performance in view of finding the one that performs best on the selected benchmark, the c) complexity trade-offs and d) interpretability advantages. Our results show that (1) Efficient KAN outperforms MLP in performance and computational efficiency, showcasing its suitability for tasks classification tasks. (2) Efficient KAN is more stable than KAN across grid sizes, depths, and layer configurations, particularly with lower learning rates. (3) KAN maintains competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models like HIVE-COTE2, with smaller architectures and faster training times, supporting its balance of performance and transparency. (4) The interpretability of the KAN model aligns with findings from SHAP analysis, reinforcing its capacity for transparent decision-making.</p></details> |  |

FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |

While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose AdapTS to answer this question. AdapTS is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. AdapTS consists of two parts: a) the AdapTS-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the AdapTS-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the AdapTS-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of AdapTS in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using AdapTS improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | 8 pages, Preprint |

Yet, existing neural methods for this purpose have a key limitation: while some adjust for time-varying confounding, these methods assume that the time series are recorded in discrete time. In other words, they are constrained to settings where measurements and treatments are conducted at fixed time steps, even though this is unrealistic in medical practice. In this work, we aim to estimate CAPOs in continuous time. The latter is of direct practical relevance because it allows for modeling patient trajectories where measurements and treatments take place at arbitrary, irregular timestamps. We thus propose a new method called stabilized continuous time inverse propensity network (SCIP-Net). For this, we further derive stabilized inverse propensity weights for robust estimation of the CAPOs. To the best of our knowledge, our SCIP-Net is the first neural method that performs proper adjustments for time-varying confounding in continuous time.</p></details> |  |

More recently, they have been applied to analyzing physiological time-series like wearable data for health insight extraction. Existing methods embed raw numerical sequences directly into prompts, which exceeds token limits and increases computational costs. Additionally, some studies integrated features extracted from time-series in textual prompts or applied multimodal approaches. However, these methods often produce generic and unreliable outputs due to LLMs' limited analytical rigor and inefficiency in interpreting continuous waveforms. In this paper, we develop an LLM-powered agent for physiological time-series analysis aimed to bridge the gap in integrating LLMs with well-established analytical tools. Built on the OpenCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, our agent features an orchestrator that integrates user interaction, data sources, and analytical tools to generate accurate health insights. To evaluate its effectiveness, we implement a case study on heart rate (HR) estimation from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals using a dataset of PPG and Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings in a remote health monitoring study. The agent's performance is benchmarked against OpenAI GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, with ECG serving as the gold standard for HR estimation. Results demonstrate that our agent significantly outperforms benchmark models by achieving lower error rates and more reliable HR estimations. The agent implementation is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

While adaptive optimizers such as AdamW are widely used, they suffer from critical limitations, including an inability to capture interdependencies between coordinates and high memory consumption. Subsequent research, exemplified by SOAP, attempts to better capture coordinate interdependence but incurs greater memory overhead, limiting scalability for massive LLMs. An alternative approach aims to reduce memory consumption through low-dimensional projection, but this leads to substantial approximation errors, resulting in less effective optimization (e.g., in terms of per-token efficiency). In this paper, we propose COSMOS, a novel hybrid optimizer that leverages the varying importance of eigensubspaces in the gradient matrix to achieve memory efficiency without compromising optimization performance. The design of COSMOS is motivated by our empirical insights and practical considerations. Specifically, COSMOS applies SOAP to the leading eigensubspace, which captures the primary optimization dynamics, and MUON to the remaining eigensubspace, which is less critical but computationally expensive to handle with SOAP. This hybrid strategy significantly reduces memory consumption while maintaining robust optimization performance, making it particularly suitable for massive LLMs. Numerical experiments on various datasets and transformer architectures are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of COSMOS. Our code is available at https://github.com/lliu606/COSMOS.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While natural language offers human-accessible flexibility but suffers from ambiguity, symbolic reasoning provides precise, machine-executable inferences at the cost of strict domain constraints. We introduce HYBRIDMIND, an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal reasoning approach for each reasoning problem. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate both prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned open-source models. We find that fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as a meta-selector outperforms GPT-4o's natural language reasoning by 4.4\% on FOLIO and 1.3\% on MATH. More notably, using GPT-3.5-turbo as a prompted meta-selector yields a 10\% improvement on FOLIO's challenging subset compared to GPT-4o. We will release our code and data to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Using fuzzy graph, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and community detection, we analyze embeddings from diverse LLMs, finding significant categorical community structure aligned with predefined concepts and categories aligned with humans. We observe these groupings exhibit within-cluster organization (such as hierarchies, topological ordering, etc.), hypothesizing a fundamental structure that precedes contextual processing. To further investigate the conceptual nature of these groupings, we explore cross-model alignments across different LLM categories within their input embeddings, observing a medium to high degree of alignment. Furthermore, provide evidence that manipulating these groupings can play a functional role in mitigating ethnicity bias in LLM tasks.</p></details> |  |

More precisely, for non-halting queries, the LLM never samples the end-of-string token <eos>. We rigorously analyze the conditions under which the non-halting anomaly presents itself. In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating (cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then the LLM does not halt. We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base unaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting cyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple recipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates a prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's success in sending every major model released over the past year into a non-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures. Further, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show that the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates ranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that the proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two orders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports. We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short prompts to induce the non-halting state. We inverted 10,000 random repeating 2-cycle outputs for llama-3.1-8b-instruct. Out of 10,000 three-token inverted prompts 1,512 yield non-halting queries reaching a rate of 15%. Our experiments with ARCA show that non-halting may be easily induced with as few as 3 input tokens with high probability. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that non-halting queries are prevalent and relatively easy to find.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior methods that require external knowledge, we mutually reinforce the LLM\'s dialogue synthesis and summarization capabilities, allowing them to complement each other during training and enhance overall performances. The dialogue synthesis capability is enhanced by directed preference optimization with preference scoring from summarization capability. The summarization capability is enhanced by the additional high quality dialogue-summary paired data produced by the dialogue synthesis capability. By leveraging the proposed MRDS mechanism, we elicit the internal knowledge of LLM in the format of synthetic data, and use it to augment the few-shot real training dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that our method improves dialogue summarization, achieving a 1.5% increase in ROUGE scores and a 0.3% improvement in BERT scores in few-shot settings. Furthermore, our method attains the highest average scores in human evaluations, surpassing both the pre-trained models and the baselines fine-tuned solely for summarization tasks.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we thoroughly analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 38.3% compared with KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

To address these challenges, we present $D^2$-MoE, a new delta decompression compressor for reducing the parameters of MoE LLMs. Based on observations of expert diversity, we decompose their weights into a shared base weight and unique delta weights. Specifically, our method first merges each expert's weight into the base weight using the Fisher information matrix to capture shared components. Then, we compress delta weights through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) by exploiting their low-rank properties. Finally, we introduce a semi-dynamical structured pruning strategy for the base weights, combining static and dynamic redundancy analysis to achieve further parameter reduction while maintaining input adaptivity. In this way, our $D^2$-MoE successfully compact MoE LLMs to high compression ratios without additional training. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of our approach, with over 13% performance gains than other compressors on Mixtral|Phi-3.5|DeepSeek|Qwen2 MoE LLMs at 40$\sim$60% compression rates.

The combined capability of some smaller, resource-friendly LLMs can address most of the instructions that larger LLMs excel at. In this work, we explore how to route the best-performing LLM for each instruction to achieve better overall performance. We develop a new paradigm, constructing capability instructions with model capability representation, user instruction, and performance inquiry prompts to assess the performance. To learn from capability instructions, we introduce a new end-to-end framework called Model Selection with Aptitude Test (Model-SAT), which generates positive and negative samples based on what different models perform well or struggle with. Model-SAT uses a model capability encoder that extends its model representation to a lightweight LLM. Our experiments show that Model-SAT understands the performance dimensions of candidate models and provides the probabilities of their capability to handle various instructions. Additionally, during deployment, a new model can quickly infer its aptitude test results across 50 tasks, each with 20 shots.

We present a public benchmark, PersonalLLM, focusing on adapting LLMs to provide maximal benefits for a particular user.

Instead of persona-prompting LLMs based on high-level attributes (e.g., user's race or response length), which yields homogeneous preferences relative to humans, we develop a method that can simulate a large user base with diverse preferences from a set of pre-trained reward models. Our dataset and generated personalities offer an innovative testbed for developing personalization algorithms that grapple with continual data sparsity--few relevant feedback from the particular user--by leveraging historical data from other (similar) users.

| **[Unveiling Downstream Performance Scaling of LLMs: A Clustering-Based Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17262v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17262v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in computing dramatically increase the scale and cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs). Accurately predicting downstream task performance prior to model training is crucial for efficient resource allocation, yet remains challenging due to two primary constraints: (1) the "emergence phenomenon", wherein downstream performance metrics become meaningful only after extensive training, which limits the ability to use smaller models for prediction; (2) Uneven task difficulty distributions and the absence of consistent scaling laws, resulting in substantial metric variability. Existing performance prediction methods suffer from limited accuracy and reliability, thereby impeding the assessment of potential LLM capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Clustering-On-Difficulty (COD) downstream performance prediction framework. COD first constructs a predictable support subset by clustering tasks based on difficulty features, strategically excluding non-emergent and non-scalable clusters. The scores on the selected subset serve as effective intermediate predictors of downstream performance on the full evaluation set. With theoretical support, we derive a mapping function that transforms performance metrics from the predictable subset to the full evaluation set, thereby ensuring accurate extrapolation of LLM downstream performance. The proposed method has been applied to predict performance scaling for a 70B LLM, providing actionable insights for training resource allocation and assisting in monitoring the training process. Notably, COD achieves remarkable predictive accuracy on the 70B LLM by leveraging an ensemble of small models, demonstrating an absolute mean deviation of 1.36% across eight important LLM evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> | 21 pages,6 figures |

The Intermediate Language Problem in Neurosymbolic Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17216v1)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17216v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning tasks manifest themselves as a challenge to Large Language Models (LLMs). Neurosymbolic approaches use LLMs to translate logical reasoning problems formulated in natural language into a formal intermediate language. Subsequently, the usage of symbolic reasoners yields reliable solving thereof. However, LLMs often fail in translation due to poorly chosen intermediate languages. We introduce the intermediate language problem, which is the problem of choosing a suitable formal language representation for neurosymbolic approaches. Theoretically, we argue that its origins lie in the inability of LLMs to distinguish syntax from semantics and the relative independence of the problem from its representation. We showcase its existence experimentally by contrasting two intermediate languages, Answer Set Programming and the Python Knowledge Engine. In addition, we demonstrate the effects of varying degrees of supplementary context information. Our results show a maximum difference in overall-accuracy of 53.20% and 49.26% in execution-accuracy. When using the GPT4o-mini LLM we beat the state-of-the-art in overall-accuracy on the ProntoQA dataset by 21.20% and by 50.50% on the ProofWriter dataset.</p></details> |  |

This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on LLaMA Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

Currently, state-of-the-art LLMs utilize this architecture. There is a substantial amount of research on how to train such models and how to select hyperparameters for this architecture. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on post-evaluation analysis of MoE layer properties. In this paper, we take a first step toward closing this gap by evaluating expert contributions on the quiz-based MMLU benchmark. We show that most experts were never activated during inference on this benchmark. Additionally, the output distribution of gating networks is much closer to uniform than sparse. Finally, we demonstrate that the average performance of some experts within the same layer varies significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, short paper</p></details> |

Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON, a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages -- Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.</p></details> |  |

For training, we adopt the progressing module replacement method and show that the lightweight training of the low-rank modules with approximately 30M-40M tokens is sufficient to achieve performance on par with LLMs of comparable sizes trained from scratch. We release the resultant models, DeltaLLAMA and DeltaPHI, with a 12% parameter reduction, retaining 90% of the performance of the base Llama and Phi models on common knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. Our method also outperforms compression techniques JointDrop, LaCo, ShortGPT and SliceGPT with the same number of parameters removed. For example, DeltaPhi 2.9B with a 24% reduction achieves similar average zero-shot accuracies as recovery fine-tuned SlicedPhi 3.3B with a 12% reduction, despite being approximately 400M parameters smaller with no fine-tuning applied. This work provides new insights into LLM architecture design and compression methods when storage space is critical.</p></details> |  |

However, as the conversation rounds continue, it is required to store a large amount of KV cache in GPU memory, which significantly affects the efficiency and even availability of the model serving systems. This paper analyzes dialogue data from real users and discovers that the LLM inference manifests a watershed layer, after which the distribution of round-level attention shows notable similarity. We propose Round Attention, a novel round-level attention mechanism that only recalls and computes the KV cache of the most relevant rounds. The experiments show that our method saves 55\% memory usage without compromising model performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has shown that LLMs may also be susceptible to framing but has done so on synthetic data and did not compare to human behavior. We introduce WildFrame, a dataset for evaluating LLM responses to positive and negative framing, in naturally-occurring sentences, and compare humans on the same data. WildFrame consists of 1,000 texts, first selecting real-world statements with clear sentiment, then reframing them in either positive or negative light, and lastly, collecting human sentiment annotations. By evaluating eight state-of-the-art LLMs on WildFrame, we find that all models exhibit framing effects similar to humans ($r\geq0.57$), with both humans and models being more influenced by positive rather than negative reframing. Our findings benefit model developers, who can either harness framing or mitigate its effects, depending on the downstream application.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese.

While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a state-of-the-art score of $72.95\%$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled. To facilitate further research and development in this area, we have open-sourced our model at https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/BFS-Prover.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Causal Generative Adversarial Networks (CausalGANs) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning (RL) to generate high-fidelity synthetic bond yield data for four major bond categories (AAA, BAA, US10Y, Junk). By incorporating 12 key macroeconomic variables, we ensure statistical fidelity by preserving essential market properties. To transform this market dependent synthetic data into actionable insights, we employ a finetuned Large Language Model (LLM) Qwen2.5-7B that generates trading signals (BUY/HOLD/SELL), risk assessments, and volatility projections. We use automated, human and LLM evaluations, all of which demonstrate that our framework improves forecasting performance over existing methods, with statistical validation via predictive accuracy, MAE evaluation(0.103%), profit/loss evaluation (60% profit rate), LLM evaluation (3.37/5) and expert assessments scoring 4.67 out of 5. The reinforcement learning-enhanced synthetic data generation achieves the least Mean Absolute Error of 0.103, demonstrating its effectiveness in replicating real-world bond market dynamics. We not only enhance data-driven trading strategies but also provides a scalable, high-fidelity synthetic financial data pipeline for risk & volatility management and investment decision-making. This work establishes a bridge between synthetic data generation, LLM driven financial forecasting, and language model evaluation, contributing to AI-driven financial decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses challenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic understanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress in this domain, hindering further advancements. In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations.

However, existing datasets are designed for traditional machine learning methods, inadequate for LLM-based methods in terms of corpus selection, entity categorization, and design logic. This limitation leads to less effective evaluation and model fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose DynamicNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs and with dynamic categorization, transcending the limitations of fixed categorization in existing datasets. It is also multi-lingual and multi-granular, covering 8 languages and 155 entity types, with corpus spanning multiple specialized domains. Furthermore, in response to the limitations demonstrated by existing LLM-based methods during DynamicNER testing, we develop CascadeNER, a novel NER method based on a two-stage strategy and lightweight LLMs, addressing the problems in current methods. Experiments show that DynamicNER is an effective benchmark for LLM-based NER methods, and CascadeNER outperforms existing methods with fewer computational resources.

As LLM-assisted services become popular, achieving cost-effective LLM inference on budget-friendly hardware becomes the trend. Extensive researches relocate LLM parameters from expensive GPUs to host memory. However, the restricted bandwidth between the host and GPU memory limits the inference performance. This work introduces Hermes, a budget-friendly system that leverages the near-data processing (NDP) within commodity DRAM DIMMs to enhance the performance of a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving efficient LLM inference. The inherent activation sparsity in LLMs naturally divides weight parameters into two categories, termed ``hot" and ``cold" neurons, respectively. Hot neurons, which consist of only approximately 20\% of all weight parameters, account for 80\% of the total computational load, while cold neurons make up the other 80\% of parameters but are responsible for just 20\% of the computational load. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous computing strategy: mapping hot neurons to a single computation-efficient GPU, while offloading cold neurons to NDP-DIMMs, which offer large memory size but limited computation capabilities. Meanwhile, the dynamic nature of activation sparsity needs a real-time partition of hot/cold neurons and adaptive remapping of cold neurons across multiple NDP-DIMM modules. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight predictor optimizing real-time neuron partition and adjustment between GPU and NDP-DIMMs. We also utilize a window-based online scheduling mechanism to maintain load balance among NDP-DIMM modules. Hermes facilitates the deployment of LLaMA2-70B on consumer-grade hardware at 13.75 tokens/s and realizes an average 75.24$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading-based inference system.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, accepted by HPCA 2025</p></details> |

This experience offers users a significantly higher level of controllability compared to traditional RS, enabling an entirely new dimension of recommendation experiences. Building on this context, this study explored the unique experiences that LLM-powered CRS can provide compared to traditional RS. Through a three-week diary study with 12 participants using custom GPTs for music recommendations, we found that LLM-powered CRS can (1) help users clarify implicit needs, (2) support unique exploration, and (3) facilitate a deeper understanding of musical preferences. Based on these findings, we discuss the new design space enabled by LLM-powered CRS and highlight its potential to support more personalized, user-driven recommendation experiences.</p></details> |  |

However, naively applying SVD to derive residual paths causes suboptimal utilization of the low-rank representation capacity. Instead, we propose Training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA), a method that directly minimizes compression-induced errors without requiring gradient-based training, achieving fast optimization in minutes using a small amount of calibration data. EoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, leveraging eigenvalues to effectively prioritize the reconstruction of high-importance error components. Moreover, EoRA can be seamlessly integrated with fine-tuning and quantization to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. EoRA consistently outperforms previous methods in compensating errors for compressed LLaMA2/3 models on various tasks, such as language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning tasks (e.g., 31.31%/12.88% and 9.69% improvements on ARC-Easy/ARC-Challenge and MathQA when compensating LLaMA3-8B that is quantized to 4-bit and pruned to 2:4 sparsity). EoRA offers a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, making it a powerful tool to deploy LLMs more flexibly.

This approach processes user-item content pairs as input and evaluates each pair iteratively. To maintain efficiency, existing methods rely on pre-filtering a small candidate pool of user-item pairs. However, this severely limits the inferential capabilities of LLMs by reducing their scope to only a few hundred pre-filtered candidates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel "Text-to-Distribution" paradigm, which predicts an item's interaction probability distribution for the entire user set in a single inference. Specifically, we present FilterLLM, a framework that extends the next-word prediction capabilities of LLMs to billion-scale filtering tasks. FilterLLM first introduces a tailored distribution prediction and cold-start framework. Next, FilterLLM incorporates an efficient user-vocabulary structure to train and store the embeddings of billion-scale users. Finally, we detail the training objectives for both distribution prediction and user-vocabulary construction. The proposed framework has been deployed on the Alibaba platform, where it has been serving cold-start recommendations for two months, processing over one billion cold items. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FilterLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start recommendation tasks, achieving over 30 times higher efficiency. Furthermore, an online A/B test validates its effectiveness in billion-scale recommendation systems.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches face significant challenges: they require large Floating Point (FP) computation, raising privacy concerns when handling sensitive data, and are impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques reduce trainable parameters, their reliance on floating-point arithmetic creates fundamental incompatibilities with edge hardware. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for on-device LLM fine-tuning that eliminates the need for floating-point operations in both inference and training, named GSQ-Tuning. At its core is the Group-Shared Exponents Integer format, which efficiently represents model parameters in integer format using shared exponents among parameter groups. When combined with LoRA-like adapters, this enables fully integer-based fine-tuning that is both memory and compute efficient. We demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to BF16-based fine-tuning while significantly reducing 1.85x memory usage. Moreover, compared to FP8, our method can reduce 5x power consumption and 11x chip area with same performance, making large-scale model adaptation feasible on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

It incorporates the largest known Indic dataset, mitigating data scarcity and ensuring balanced performance across dialects. Krutrim outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models on Indic benchmarks while maintaining competitive English performance. Despite being significantly smaller in training flops, Krutrim LLM matches or exceeds models like LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks, with an average score of 0.57 versus 0.55. This evidences Krutrim's flexible multilingual fluency across diverse linguistic contexts. Krutrim is integrated with real-time search to improve factual accuracy in conversational AI applications. This enhances accessibility for over 1 billion users worldwide. Through intentional design choices addressing data imbalances, Krutrim LLM signifies meaningful progress in building ethical, globally representative AI models.</p></details> |  |

We first evaluate five LLMs' economic decision-making capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems under two distinct scenarios: with explicit utility functions and based on intuitive reasoning. While previous research has often simulated heterogeneity by solely varying prompts, our approach harnesses the inherent variations in analytical capabilities across different LLMs to model agents with diverse cognitive traits. Building on these findings, we construct a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework by mapping these LLMs to specific educational groups and corresponding income brackets. Using interest-income taxation as a case study, we demonstrate how the MLAB framework can simulate policy impacts across heterogeneous agents, offering a promising new direction for economic and public policy analysis by leveraging LLMs' human-like reasoning capabilities and computational power.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Indic QA Benchmark, a large dataset for context grounded question answering in 11 major Indian languages, covering both extractive and abstractive tasks. Evaluations of multilingual LLMs, including instruction finetuned versions, revealed weak performance in low resource languages due to a strong English language bias in their training data. We also investigated the Translate Test paradigm,where inputs are translated to English for processing and the results are translated back into the source language for output. This approach outperformed multilingual LLMs, particularly in low resource settings. By releasing Indic QA, we aim to promote further research into LLMs question answering capabilities in low resource languages. This benchmark offers a critical resource to address existing limitations and foster multilingual understanding.</p></details> |  |

Many existing alignment approaches rely on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which assumes the existence of a ground-truth reward for each prompt-response pair. However, this assumption can be overly restrictive when modeling complex human preferences. In this paper, we drop the BT model assumption and study LLM alignment under general preferences, formulated as a two-player game. Drawing on theoretical insights from learning in games, we integrate optimistic online mirror descent into our alignment framework to approximate the Nash policy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach achieves an $O(T^{-1})$ bound on the duality gap, improving upon the previous $O(T^{-1/2})$ result. More importantly, we implement our method and show through experiments that it outperforms state-of-the-art RLHF algorithms across multiple representative benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |

With the strong capabilities of code comprehension, the recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in diagnosing bugs in the code. Nevertheless, due to LLMs' limited performance in handling long contexts, existing LLM-based fault localization remains on localizing bugs within a small code scope (i.e., a method or a class), which struggles to diagnose bugs for a large code scope (i.e., an entire software system). To address the limitation, this paper presents AgentFL, a multi-agent system based on ChatGPT for automated fault localization. By simulating the behavior of a human developer, AgentFL models the FL task as a three-step process, which involves comprehension, navigation, and confirmation. Within each step, AgentFL hires agents with diversified expertise, each of which utilizes different tools to handle specific tasks. Particularly, we adopt a series of auxiliary strategies such as Test Behavior Tracking, Document-Guided Search, and Multi-Round Dialogue to overcome the challenges in each step. The evaluation on the widely used Defects4J-V1.2.0 benchmark shows that AgentFL can localize 157 out of 395 bugs within Top-1, which outperforms the other LLM-based approaches and exhibits complementarity to the state-of-the-art learning-based techniques. Additionally, we confirm the indispensability of the components in AgentFL with the ablation study and demonstrate the usability of AgentFL through a user study. Finally, the cost analysis shows that AgentFL spends an average of only 0.074 dollars and 97 seconds for a single bug.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added a comment to refer to the published version</p></details> |

However, the pervasive issue of alpha decay, where factors lose their predictive power over time, poses a significant challenge for alpha mining. Traditional methods like genetic programming face rapid alpha decay from overfitting and complexity, while approaches driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their promise, often rely too heavily on existing knowledge, creating homogeneous factors that worsen crowding and accelerate decay. To address this challenge, we propose AlphaAgent, an autonomous framework that effectively integrates LLM agents with ad hoc regularizations for mining decay-resistant alpha factors. AlphaAgent employs three key mechanisms: (i) originality enforcement through a similarity measure based on abstract syntax trees (ASTs) against existing alphas, (ii) hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM-evaluated semantic consistency between market hypotheses and generated factors, and (iii) complexity control via AST-based structural constraints, preventing over-engineered constructions that are prone to overfitting. These mechanisms collectively guide the alpha generation process to balance originality, financial rationale, and adaptability to evolving market conditions, mitigating the risk of alpha decay. Extensive evaluations show that AlphaAgent outperforms traditional and LLM-based methods in mitigating alpha decay across bull and bear markets, consistently delivering significant alpha in Chinese CSI 500 and US S&P 500 markets over the past four years. Notably, AlphaAgent showcases remarkable resistance to alpha decay, elevating the potential for yielding powerful factors.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this work, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, designed to analyze the effects of OCR noise on QA systems' performance. The MultiOCR-QA dataset comprises 60K question-answer pairs covering three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed old documents, allowing for the evaluation of OCR-induced challenges on question answering. We evaluate MultiOCR-QA on various levels and types of OCR errors to access the robustness of LLMs in handling real-world digitization errors. Our findings show that QA systems are highly prone to OCR induced errors and exhibit performance degradation on noisy OCR text.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 20 figures |

Although these "black-box" models achieve impressive predictive performance, they often suffer from a lack of transparency and explainability. Contrary to the presumed tradeoff between explainability and accuracy, we show that integrating large language models (LLMs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can improve both. We propose LR-Recsys, which augments DNN-based systems with LLM reasoning capabilities. LR-Recsys introduces a contrastive-explanation generator that produces human-readable positive explanations and negative explanations. These explanations are embedded via a fine-tuned autoencoder and combined with consumer and product features to improve predictions. Beyond offering explainability, we show that LR-Recsys also improves learning efficiency and predictive accuracy, as supported by high-dimensional, multi-environment statistical learning theory. LR-Recsys outperforms state-of-the-art recommender systems by 3-14% on three real-world datasets. Importantly, our analysis reveals that these gains primarily derive from LLMs' reasoning capabilities rather than their external domain knowledge. LR-RecSys presents an effective approach to combine LLMs with traditional DNNs, two of the most widely used ML models today. The explanations generated by LR-Recsys provide actionable insights for consumers, sellers, and platforms, helping to build trust, optimize product offerings, and inform targeting strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness diminishes when dealing with large database schemas, as the context length increases. To address this limitation, we present SQLong, a novel and efficient data augmentation framework designed to enhance LLM performance in long-context scenarios for the NL2SQL task. SQLong generates augmented datasets by extending existing database schemas with additional synthetic CREATE TABLE commands and corresponding data rows, sampled from diverse schemas in the training data. This approach effectively simulates long-context scenarios during finetuning and evaluation. Through experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with SQLong-augmented data significantly outperform those trained on standard datasets. These imply SQLong's practical implementation and its impact on improving NL2SQL capabilities in real-world settings with complex database schemas.</p></details> |  |

Traditional text-to-SQL systems, which combine human engineering and deep neural networks, have made significant progress. Subsequently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been developed for text-to-SQL tasks, achieving promising results. However, as modern databases and user questions grow more complex, PLMs with a limited parameter size often produce incorrect SQL. This necessitates more sophisticated and tailored optimization methods, which restricts the application of PLM-based systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant capabilities in natural language understanding as model scale increases. Thus, integrating LLM-based solutions can bring unique opportunities, improvements, and solutions to text-to-SQL research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing LLM-based text-to-SQL studies. Specifically, we offer a brief overview of the technical challenges and evolutionary process of text-to-SQL. Next, we introduce the datasets and metrics designed to evaluate text-to-SQL systems. Subsequently, we present a systematic analysis of recent advances in LLM-based text-to-SQL. Finally, we make a summarization and discuss the remaining challenges in this field and suggest expectations for future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior approaches that focus primarily on post-exploitation or require a human-in-the-loop, RapidPen leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously discover and exploit vulnerabilities, starting from a single IP address. By integrating advanced ReAct-style task planning (Re) with retrieval-augmented knowledge bases of successful exploits, along with a command-generation and direct execution feedback loop (Act), RapidPen systematically scans services, identifies viable attack vectors, and executes targeted exploits in a fully automated manner. In our evaluation against a vulnerable target from the Hack The Box platform, RapidPen achieved shell access within 200-400 seconds at a per-run cost of approximately \$0.3-\$0.6, demonstrating a 60\% success rate when reusing prior "success-case" data. These results underscore the potential of truly autonomous pentesting for both security novices and seasoned professionals. Organizations without dedicated security teams can leverage RapidPen to quickly identify critical vulnerabilities, while expert pentesters can offload repetitive tasks and focus on complex challenges. Ultimately, our work aims to make penetration testing more accessible and cost-efficient, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of modern software ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art unlearning methods face a critical vulnerability: they are susceptible to ``relearning'' the removed information from a small number of forget data points, known as relearning attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate how to make unlearned models robust against such attacks. For the first time, we establish a connection between robust unlearning and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) through a unified robust optimization framework, in an analogy to adversarial training designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our analysis for SAM reveals that smoothness optimization plays a pivotal role in mitigating relearning attacks. Thus, we further explore diverse smoothing strategies to enhance unlearning robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including WMDP and MUSE, demonstrate that SAM and other smoothness optimization approaches consistently improve the resistance of LLM unlearning to relearning attacks. Notably, smoothness-enhanced unlearning also helps defend against (input-level) jailbreaking attacks, broadening our proposal's impact in robustifying LLM unlearning.

Recognizing that not all tasks necessitate models with over 100 billion parameters, we introduce OptiRoute, an advanced model routing engine designed to dynamically select and route tasks to the optimal LLM based on detailed user-defined requirements. OptiRoute captures both functional (e.g., accuracy, speed, cost) and non-functional (e.g., helpfulness, harmlessness, honesty) criteria, leveraging lightweight task analysis and complexity estimation to efficiently match tasks with the best-fit models from a diverse array of LLMs. By employing a hybrid approach combining k-nearest neighbors (kNN) search and hierarchical filtering, OptiRoute optimizes for user priorities while minimizing computational overhead. This makes it ideal for real-time applications in cloud-based ML platforms, personalized AI services, and regulated industries.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |

A Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00581v2)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.00581v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into critical applications, aligning their behavior with human values presents significant challenges. Current methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), typically focus on a limited set of coarse-grained values and are resource-intensive. Moreover, the correlations between these values remain implicit, leading to unclear explanations for value-steering outcomes. Our work argues that a latent causal value graph underlies the value dimensions of LLMs and that, despite alignment training, this structure remains significantly different from human value systems. We leverage these causal value graphs to guide two lightweight value-steering methods: role-based prompting and sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, effectively mitigating unexpected side effects. Furthermore, SAE provides a more fine-grained approach to value steering. Experiments on Gemma-2B-IT and Llama3-8B-IT demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In two experiments, we investigate the causal and compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs and humans in the domain of object affordances, an area traditionally linked to embodied cognition. The tasks, designed from scratch to avoid data contamination, require decision-makers to select unconventional objects to replace a typical tool for a particular purpose, such as using a table tennis racket to dig a hole. In Experiment 1, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, finding that GPT-4o, when given chain-of-thought prompting, performed on par with human participants, while GPT-3.5 lagged significantly. In Experiment 2, we introduced two new conditions, Distractor (more object choices, increasing difficulty) and Image (object options presented visually), and evaluated Claude 3 Sonnet and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in addition to the GPT models. The Distractor condition significantly impaired performance across humans and models, although GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 still performed well above chance. Surprisingly, the Image condition had little impact on humans or GPT-4o, but significantly lowered Claude 3.5's accuracy. Qualitative analysis showed that GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 have a stronger ability than their predecessors to identify and flexibly apply causally relevant object properties. The improvement from GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 suggests that models are increasingly capable of causal and compositional reasoning in some domains, although further mechanistic research is necessary to understand how LLMs reason.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies have developed LLM-based guard models designed to moderate the input and output of threat LLMs, ensuring adherence to safety policies by blocking content that violates these protocols upon deployment. However, limited attention has been given to the reliability and calibration of such guard models. In this work, we empirically conduct comprehensive investigations of confidence calibration for 9 existing LLM-based guard models on 12 benchmarks in both user input and model output classification. Our findings reveal that current LLM-based guard models tend to 1) produce overconfident predictions, 2) exhibit significant miscalibration when subjected to jailbreak attacks, and 3) demonstrate limited robustness to the outputs generated by different types of response models. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of post-hoc calibration methods to mitigate miscalibration. We demonstrate the efficacy of temperature scaling and, for the first time, highlight the benefits of contextual calibration for confidence calibration of guard models, particularly in the absence of validation sets. Our analysis and experiments underscore the limitations of current LLM-based guard models and provide valuable insights for the future development of well-calibrated guard models toward more reliable content moderation. We also advocate for incorporating reliability evaluation of confidence calibration when releasing future LLM-based guard models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Ternary quantization for LLMs is promising in maintaining model accuracy while reducing memory footprint. However, existing accelerators have not exploited this potential for on-chip inference. We present TerEffic, an FPGA-based accelerator that carefully co-designs memory architecture and computational units to unlock highly efficient LLM inference with fully on-chip execution. Through weight compression, custom computational units, and memory hierarchy optimization, we achieve unprecedented efficiency by eliminating off-chip memory bandwidth bottlenecks. We propose two architectural variants: a fully on-chip design for smaller models and an HBM-assisted design for larger ones. When evaluated on a 370M parameter model with single-batch inference, our on-chip design achieves 12,700 tokens/sec (149 times higher than NVIDIA's Jetson Orin Nano) with a power efficiency of 467 tokens/sec/W (19 times better than Jetson Orin Nano). The HBM-assisted design provides 521 tokens/sec on a 2.7B parameter model (2 times higher than NVIDIA's A100) with 33W power consumption, achieving a power efficiency of 16 tokens/sec/W (8 times better than A100).</p></details> |  |

Our work aims to support the materials science community by providing a practical, data-driven resource. We have curated a comprehensive dataset of 17K expert-verified synthesis recipes from open-access literature, which forms the basis of our newly developed benchmark, AlchemyBench. AlchemyBench offers an end-to-end framework that supports research in large language models applied to synthesis prediction.

Our approach distinguishes between two categories of an evaluation metric under format constraints to reliably and accurately assess performance: one measures performance when format constraints are adhered to, while the other evaluates performance regardless of constraint adherence. We then define a metric for measuring the format bias of LLMs and establish effective strategies to reduce it. Subsequently, we present our empirical format bias evaluation spanning four commonly used categories -- multiple-choice question-answer, wrapping, list, and mapping -- covering 15 widely-used formats. Our evaluation on eight generation tasks uncovers significant format bias across state-of-the-art LLMs. We further discover that improving the format-instruction following capabilities of LLMs across formats potentially reduces format bias. Based on our evaluation findings, we study prompting and fine-tuning with synthesized format data techniques to mitigate format bias. Our methods successfully reduce the variance in ChatGPT's performance among wrapping formats from 235.33 to 0.71 (%$^2$).</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

A Black Box Evaluation of LLM Unlearning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12103v3)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.12103v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model unlearning aims to remove harmful information that LLMs have learnt to prevent their use for malicious purposes. LLMU and RMU have been proposed as two methods for LLM unlearning, achieving impressive results on unlearning benchmarks. We study in detail the impact of unlearning on LLM performance metrics using the WMDP dataset as well as a new biology dataset we create. We show that unlearning has a notable impact on general model capabilities, with the performance degradation being more significant in general for LLMU. We further test the robustness of the two methods and find that doing 5-shot prompting or rephrasing the question in simple ways can lead to an over ten-fold increase in accuracy on unlearning benchmarks. Finally, we show that training on unrelated data can almost completely recover pre-unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods fail at truly unlearning. Our methodology serves as an evaluation framework for LLM unlearning methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/JaiDoshi/Knowledge-Erasure.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The integration of autonomous driving in military settings reduces human casualties and enables precise and safe execution of missions in hazardous environments while allowing for reliable logistics support without the risks associated with fatigue-related errors. However, relying on autonomous driving solely requires an advanced decision-making model that is adaptable and optimum in any situation. Considering the presence of numerous interconnected autonomous vehicles in mission-critical scenarios, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is vital for ensuring seamless coordination, real-time data exchange, and instantaneous response to dynamic driving environments. The advent of 6G strengthens the Internet of Automated Defense Vehicles (IoADV) concept within the realm of Internet of Military Defense Things (IoMDT) by enabling robust connectivity, crucial for real-time data exchange, advanced navigation, and enhanced safety features through IoADV interactions. On the other hand, a critical advancement in this space is using pre-trained Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making and communication optimization for autonomous driving. Hence, this work presents opportunities and challenges with a vision of realizing the full potential of these technologies in critical defense applications, especially through the advancement of IoADV and its role in enhancing autonomous military operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Internet of Things Magazine</p></details> |

While existing LLM-based grading systems are promising, most of them rely on one single model, which limits their performance. To address this, we propose Ensemble Tree-of-Thought (ToT), a framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating multiple models. Using this framework, we develop a grading system. Ensemble ToT follows three steps: (1) analyzing LLM performance, (2) generating candidate answers, and (3) refining them into a final result. Based on this, our grading system first evaluates the grading tendencies of LLMs, then generates multiple results, and finally integrates them via a simulated debate. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's ability to provide accurate and explainable grading by effectively coordinating multiple LLMs.</p></details> | 33 pages, 25 figures |

However, the exploratory nature of data science, alongside the stochastic and opaque outputs of LLMs, raise concerns about their reliability. While prior work focuses on benchmarking LLM accuracy, reproducibility remains underexplored, despite being critical to establishing trust in LLM-driven analysis. We propose a novel analyst-inspector framework to automatically evaluate and enforce the reproducibility of LLM-generated data science workflows - the first rigorous approach to the best of our knowledge. Defining reproducibility as the sufficiency and completeness of workflows for reproducing functionally equivalent code, this framework enforces computational reproducibility principles, ensuring transparent, well-documented LLM workflows while minimizing reliance on implicit model assumptions. Using this framework, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs on 1,032 data analysis tasks across three diverse benchmark datasets. We also introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies. Our results show that higher reproducibility strongly correlates with improved accuracy and reproducibility-enhancing prompts are effective, demonstrating structured prompting's potential to enhance automated data science workflows and enable transparent, robust AI-driven analysis.

Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004\% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors.</p></details> |  |

PLDR-LLM learns a singularity condition for the deductive outputs that enable the once-inferred energy-curvature tensor $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ to replace the deep neural network of power law graph attention (PLGA) generating the deductive outputs at inference. We demonstrate that a cache for $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ (G-cache) and KV-cache can be implemented in a straightforward manner to improve the inference time. The invariance and generalizable nature of deductive outputs is at a very high fidelity where deductive outputs have same RMSE and determinant values up to 15 decimal places after caching, and zero-shot benchmark scores remain unchanged. Ablation studies show that learned deductive outputs have distinct loss and accuracy characteristics from models pretrained with transferred, randomly initialized or identity tensors as a constant tensor operator and an LLM with scaled-dot product attention (SDPA) is a special case of PLDR-LLM where $\mathbf{G}_{LM}$ is predefined as identity. The observed invariance characteristic introduces a novel asymmetry between training and inference phases with caching. We outline observed common characteristics of the deductive outputs for the learned singularity condition.

These methods inherently compromise model capabilities and might make auto-regressive models vulnerable to attacks that make likely an initial token of affirmative response. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token (<rf>) and propose to fine-tune the model to generate this token at any time harmful content is generated or about to be generated. This novel safety training method effectively augments LLMs into generative classifiers of harmfulness at all times during the conversation. This method offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer rather than just the input prompt and provides a stronger defence against sampling-based attacks. In addition, it simplifies the evaluation of the model's robustness and reduces correlated failures when combined with a classifier. We further show an increased robustness to long contexts, and supervised fine-tuning attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, the nature of these extracted features and their alignment with human-engineered ones remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art, fine-tuned LLMs for passage reranking. We employ a probing-based analysis to examine neuron activations in ranking LLMs, identifying the presence of known human-engineered and semantic features. Our study spans a broad range of feature categories, including lexical signals, document structure, query-document interactions, and complex semantic representations, to uncover underlying patterns influencing ranking decisions. Through experiments on four different ranking LLMs, we identify statistical IR features that are prominently encoded in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably missing. Furthermore, we analyze how these models respond to out-of-distribution queries and documents, revealing distinct generalization behaviors. By dissecting the latent representations within LLM activations, we aim to improve both the interpretability and effectiveness of ranking models. Our findings offer crucial insights for developing more transparent and reliable retrieval systems, and we release all necessary scripts and code to support further exploration.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.

However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS '24</p></details> |

However, substantial similarity is difficult to define algorithmically and a narrow focus on model outputs is insufficient to address all copyright risks. In this interdisciplinary work, we take a complementary "structural" perspective and shift our focus to how LLMs are trained. We operationalize a notion of "fair learning" by measuring whether any training decision substantially affected the model's memorization. As a case study, we deconstruct Pythia, an open-source LLM, and demonstrate the use of causal and correlational analyses to make factual determinations about Pythia's training decisions. By proposing a legal standard for fair learning and connecting memorization analyses to this standard, we identify how judges may advance the goals of copyright law through adjudication. Finally, we discuss how a fair learning standard might evolve to enhance its clarity by becoming more rule-like and incorporating external technical guidelines.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce ThinkBench, a novel evaluation framework designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning capability robustly. ThinkBench proposes a dynamic data generation method for constructing out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets and offers an OOD dataset that contains 2,912 samples drawn from reasoning tasks. ThinkBench unifies the evaluation of reasoning models and non-reasoning models. We evaluate 16 LLMs and 4 PRMs under identical experimental conditions and show that most of the LLMs' performance are far from robust and they face a certain level of data leakage. By dynamically generating OOD datasets, ThinkBench effectively provides a reliable evaluation of LLMs and reduces the impact of data contamination.</p></details> |  |

We validate the original findings using a range of open-weight models (1.5B-70B parameters) and GPT-4o Mini while introducing several novel contributions. We analyze the Pareto front of the games, propose a communication-free baseline to test whether successful negotiations are possible without agent interaction, evaluate recent small language models' performance, analyze structural information leakage in model responses, and implement an inequality metric to assess negotiation fairness. Our results demonstrate that smaller models (<10B parameters) struggle with format adherence and coherent responses, but larger open-weight models can approach proprietary model performance. Additionally, in many scenarios, single-agent approaches can achieve comparable results to multi-agent negotiations, challenging assumptions about the necessity of agent communication to perform well on the benchmark. This work also provides insights into the accessibility, fairness, environmental impact, and privacy considerations of LLM-based negotiation systems.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[On Targeted Manipulation and Deception when Optimizing LLMs for User Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02306v3)** | 2025-02-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.02306v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often face inefficiencies and performance limitations caused by frequent channel probing and ineffective quantization. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLMKey, a novel key generation system designed to enhance efficiency and security. We identify excessive channel probing and suboptimal quantization as critical bottlenecks in current methods. To mitigate these issues, we propose an innovative large language model (LLM)-based channel probing technique that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to reduce probing rounds while preserving crucial channel information. Instead of conventional quantization, LLMKey adopts a perturbed compressed sensing-based key delivery mechanism, improving both robustness and security. Extensive evaluations are conducted in four real-world scenarios, encompassing V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) and V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) settings in both urban and rural environments. The results show that LLMKey achieves an average key agreement rate of 98.78\%, highlighting its effectiveness and reliability across diverse conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, utilizing the user data may pose significant privacy risks, potentially leading to ethical dilemmas and violations of data protection regulations. To address the privacy concerns, Federated Learning for Recommendation (Fed4Rec) has been identified as a promising solution. However, directly applying Fed4Rec in the LLM context introduces two challenges: 1) exacerbated client performance imbalance, which ultimately impacts the system's long-term effectiveness, and 2) substantial client resource costs, posing a high demand for clients' both computational and storage capability to locally train and infer LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a federated framework for LLM-based recommendation (shorted as FELLRec). Generally, FELLRec designs two key strategies. 1) Dynamic balance strategy, which designs dynamic parameter aggregation and learning speed for different clients, aiming to ensure balanced performance across clients. 2) Flexible storage strategy, which selectively retains certain sensitive LLM layers on the client side, while offloading other layers to the server, aiming to preserve privacy while saving resources. Experiment results show that FELLRec can achieve a more balanced client performance and improved overall performance in a computational and storage-efficient way while safeguarding user privacy well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Do LLMs Understand The Safety of Their Inputs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16174v1)** | 2025-02-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.16174v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of the Large Language Model (LLM) is critical, but currently used methods in most cases sacrifice the model performance to obtain increased safety or perform poorly on data outside of their adaptation distribution. We investigate existing methods for such generalization and find them insufficient. Surprisingly, while even plain LLMs recognize unsafe prompts, they may still generate unsafe responses. To avoid performance degradation and preserve safe performance, we advocate for a two-step framework, where we first identify unsafe prompts via a lightweight classifier, and apply a "safe" model only to such prompts. In particular, we explore the design of the safety detector in more detail, investigating the use of different classifier architectures and prompting techniques. Interestingly, we find that the final hidden state for the last token is enough to provide robust performance, minimizing false positives on benign data while performing well on malicious prompt detection. Additionally, we show that classifiers trained on the representations from different model layers perform comparably on the latest model layers, indicating that safety representation is present in the LLMs' hidden states at most model stages. Our work is a step towards efficient, representation-based safety mechanisms for LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While modern LLMs excel at reasoning tasks, their ability to maintain stable and consistent rule abstraction under imperfect observations remains underexplored. To fill this gap, in this work, we introduce Robust Rule Induction, a task that evaluates LLMs' capability in inferring rules from data that are fused with noisy examples. To address this task, we further propose Sample-steered Rule Refinement (SRR), a method enhancing reasoning stability via observation diversification and execution-guided feedback. Experiments across arithmetic, cryptography, and list functions reveal: (1) SRR outperforms other methods with minimal performance degradation under noise; (2) Despite slight accuracy variation, LLMs exhibit instability under noise (e.g., 0% accuracy change with only 70% consistent score); (3) Counterfactual task gaps highlight LLMs' reliance on memorized patterns over genuine abstraction. Our findings challenge LLMs' reasoning robustness, revealing susceptibility to hypothesis drift and pattern overfitting, while providing empirical evidence critical for developing human-like inductive systems.

This cognitive bias, supported by neuroscience and behavioral studies, suggests that numerical magnitudes are processed in a sublinear fashion rather than on a uniform linear scale. Inspired by this hypothesis, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a similar logarithmic-like structure in their internal numerical representations. By analyzing how numerical values are encoded across different layers of LLMs, we apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and PLS followed by geometric regression to uncover latent structures in the learned embeddings. Our findings reveal that the model's numerical representations exhibit sublinear spacing, with distances between values aligning with a logarithmic scale. This suggests that LLMs, much like humans, may encode numbers in a compressed, non-uniform manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>The n...</summary><p>The number line of LLMs</p></details> |

This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality training data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM mechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing, where model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during text generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on this idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by modeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear law, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly with the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length, and (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify hallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model training or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding strategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model factuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our findings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind hallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more predictable and controllable language models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Using a 190,000-hour dataset primarily sourced from YouTube, pre-processed with Whisper V3 pseudo-labeling, we demonstrate that the LLM-ASR architecture outperforms traditional Zipformer-Transducer models in the zero-shot rare word recognition task, after training on a large dataset. Our analysis reveals that the LLM contributes significantly to improvements in rare word error rate (R-WER), while the speech encoder primarily determines overall transcription performance (Orthographic Word Error Rate, O-WER, and Normalized Word Error Rate, N-WER). Through extensive ablation studies, we highlight the importance of adapter integration in aligning speech encoder outputs with the LLM's linguistic capabilities. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of high-quality labeled data in achieving optimal performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the synergy between LLM-based ASR architectures, paving the way for future advancements in large-scale LLM-based speech recognition systems.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</p></details> | 29 pages |

Despite its utility and plug-and-play nature, unmonitored mergers can introduce significant security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks and model merging abuse. In this paper, we identify a novel and more realistic attack surface where a malicious merger can extract targeted personally identifiable information (PII) from an aligned model with model merging. Specifically, we propose \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer}, a two-stage framework to achieve this attack: First, the attacker fine-tunes a malicious model to force it to respond to any PII-related queries. The attacker then uploads this malicious model to the model merging conductor and obtains the merged model. Second, the attacker inputs direct PII-related queries to the merged model to extract targeted PII. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{Merger-as-a-Stealer} successfully executes attacks against various LLMs and model merging methods across diverse settings, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Given that this attack enables character-level extraction for targeted PII without requiring any additional knowledge from the attacker, we stress the necessity for improved model alignment and more robust defense mechanisms to mitigate such threats.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7 legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these knowledge bases are queried to extract specific information. However, question-answering (QA) over such KGs poses a challenge due to the intrinsic complexity of natural language compared to the structured format and the size of these graphs. Despite these challenges, the structured nature of KGs can provide a solid foundation for grounding the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering organizations increased reliability and control. Recent advancements in LLMs have introduced reasoning methods at inference time to improve their performance and maximize their capabilities. In this work, we propose integrating these reasoning strategies with KGs to anchor every step or "thought" of the reasoning chains in KG data. Specifically, we evaluate both agentic and automated search methods across several reasoning strategies, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and Graph-of-Thought (GoT), using GRBench, a benchmark dataset for graph reasoning with domain-specific graphs. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline models, highlighting the benefits of grounding LLM reasoning processes in structured KG data.</p></details> |  |

To improve understanding, we evaluated closed- and open-source LLMs for extracting and prioritizing key medical terms using prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation. Materials and Methods: We assessed LLMs on 106 expert-annotated EHR notes, experimenting with (i) general vs. structured prompts, (ii) zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting, (iii) fine-tuning, and (iv) data augmentation. To enhance open-source models in low-resource settings, we used ChatGPT for data augmentation and applied ranking techniques. We incrementally increased the augmented dataset size (10 to 10,000) and conducted 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1 score and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Results and Discussion: Fine-tuning and data augmentation improved performance over other strategies. GPT-4 Turbo achieved the highest F1 (0.433), while Mistral7B with data augmentation had the highest MRR (0.746). Open-source models, when fine-tuned or augmented, outperformed closed-source models. Notably, the best F1 and MRR scores did not always align. Few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot in vanilla models, and structured prompts yielded different preferences across models. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot performance but sometimes degraded few-shot performance. Data augmentation performed comparably or better than other methods. Conclusion: Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation in improving model performance for medical jargon extraction in low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying such models in the real world often requires adapting them to the highly specialized database schemas used in specific applications. We find that existing text-to-SQL models experience significant performance drops when applied to new schemas, primarily due to the lack of domain-specific data for fine-tuning. This data scarcity also limits the ability to effectively evaluate model performance in new domains. Continuously obtaining high-quality text-to-SQL data for evolving schemas is prohibitively expensive in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose SQLsynth, a human-in-the-loop text-to-SQL data annotation system. SQLsynth streamlines the creation of high-quality text-to-SQL datasets through human-LLM collaboration in a structured workflow. A within-subjects user study comparing SQLsynth with manual annotation and ChatGPT shows that SQLsynth significantly accelerates text-to-SQL data annotation, reduces cognitive load, and produces datasets that are more accurate, natural, and diverse.

The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13574v1)** | 2025-02-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.13574v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages.

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision.

To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead.

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |
| **[Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Degradation Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15510v1)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15510v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes the Degradation Classification Pre-Training (DCPT), which enables models to learn how to classify the degradation type of input images for universal image restoration pre-training. Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features.

To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images.

Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Color Balance Prior \textbf{Guided} \textbf{Hyb}rid \textbf{Sens}e \textbf{U}nderwater \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration framework (\textbf{GuidedHybSensUIR}). This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach. This effort aims to furnish a valuable benchmarking dataset for standard basis for comparison.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing. Our codes will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ACCV2024</p></details> |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net.

Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations.

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Considering that modern smartphones are equipped with cameras capable of providing short-exposure images, we develop a blur-aware guided image restoration method that utilizes sharp structural details from short-exposure images, facilitating accurate reconstruction of heavily blurred regions. Furthermore, to restore images realistically and visually-pleasant, we develop a short-exposure guided diffusion model that explores useful features from short-exposure images and blurred regions to better constrain the diffusion process.

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention.

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality.

To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures.

Lastly, we construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset consisting of 20,405 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, project page https://chiweihsiao.github.io/refldm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Equivariant Denoisers for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05343v1)** | 2024-12-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.05343v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

We present GCC, which leverages diffusion models to inpaint color checkers into images for illumination estimation. Our key innovations include (1) a single-step deterministic inference approach that inpaints color checkers reflecting scene illumination, (2) a Laplacian decomposition technique that preserves checker structure while allowing illumination-dependent color adaptation, and (3) a mask-based data augmentation strategy for handling imprecise color checker annotations. GCC demonstrates superior robustness in cross-camera scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art worst-25% error rates of 5.15{\deg} and 4.32{\deg} in bi-directional evaluations. These results highlight our method's stability and generalization capability across different camera characteristics without requiring sensor-specific training, making it a versatile solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://chenwei891213.github.io/GCC/</p></details> |

Because each step in the iterative solution requires an expensive neural function evaluation (NFE), there has been significant interest in approximately solving these diffusion ODEs with only a few NFEs without modifying the underlying model. However, in the few NFE regime, we observe that tracking the true ODE evolution is fundamentally impossible using traditional ODE solvers. In this work, we propose a new method that learns a good solver for the DM, which we call Solving for the Solver (S4S). S4S directly optimizes a solver to obtain good generation quality by learning to match the output of a strong teacher solver. We evaluate S4S on six different pre-trained DMs, including pixel-space and latent-space DMs for both conditional and unconditional sampling. In all settings, S4S uniformly improves the sample quality relative to traditional ODE solvers. Moreover, our method is lightweight, data-free, and can be plugged in black-box on top of any discretization schedule or architecture to improve performance. Building on top of this, we also propose S4S-Alt, which optimizes both the solver and the discretization schedule. By exploiting the full design space of DM solvers, with 5 NFEs, we achieve an FID of 3.73 on CIFAR10 and 13.26 on MS-COCO, representing a $1.5\times$ improvement over previous training-free ODE methods.</p></details> |  |

As its core, we introduce a unified transformer-diffusion framework, featuring an autoregressive transformer model that synthesize extended and music-synchronized token sequences for 2D body, head and hands poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. Unlike traditional methods that primarily generate human motion in 3D, X-Dancer addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, capturing their nuanced alignment with musical beats through readily available monocular videos. To achieve this, we first build a spatially compositional token representation from 2D human pose labels associated with keypoint confidences, encoding both large articulated body movements (e.g., upper and lower body) and fine-grained motions (e.g., head and hands). We then design a music-to-motion transformer model that autoregressively generates music-aligned dance pose token sequences, incorporating global attention to both musical style and prior motion context. Finally we leverage a diffusion backbone to animate the reference image with these synthesized pose tokens through AdaIN, forming a fully differentiable end-to-end framework. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Dancer is able to produce both diverse and characterized dance videos, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods in term of diversity, expressiveness and realism. Code and model will be available for research purposes.</p></details> |  |

Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we introduce AnyTop, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for arbitrary skeleton learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism. Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, AnyTop learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that AnyTop generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing.

However, multi-grained video editing, which encompasses class-level, instance-level, and part-level modifications, remains a formidable challenge. The major difficulties in multi-grained editing include semantic misalignment of text-to-region control and feature coupling within the diffusion model. To address these difficulties, we present VideoGrain, a zero-shot approach that modulates space-time (cross- and self-) attention mechanisms to achieve fine-grained control over video content. We enhance text-to-region control by amplifying each local prompt's attention to its corresponding spatial-disentangled region while minimizing interactions with irrelevant areas in cross-attention. Additionally, we improve feature separation by increasing intra-region awareness and reducing inter-region interference in self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world scenarios.

However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We condition the cMDT with only two input signals, an audio-sequence, as well as a reference facial image. By extracting additional features directly from audio, Dimitra is able to increase quality and realism of generated videos. In particular, phoneme sequences contribute to the realism of lip motion, whereas text transcript to facial expression and head pose realism. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on two widely employed datasets, VoxCeleb2 and HDTF, showcase that Dimitra is able to outperform existing approaches for generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages + 2 pages for supplementary material, 2 figures</p></details> |

To achieve this, we resort to text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images. Our exhaustive evaluation metrics demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles multiple perception tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art models. We achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs. 1B pixel-level annotated images). Inspired by Wang et al., DICEPTION formulates the outputs of various perception tasks using color encoding; and we show that the strategy of assigning random colors to different instances is highly effective in both entity segmentation and semantic segmentation. Unifying various perception tasks as conditional image generation enables us to fully leverage pre-trained text-to-image models. Thus, DICEPTION can be efficiently trained at a cost of orders of magnitude lower, compared to conventional models that were trained from scratch. When adapting our model to other tasks, it only requires fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and 1% of its parameters. DICEPTION provides valuable insights and a more promising solution for visual generalist models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 20 figures |

However, their adaptation to mixed-type tabular data remains underexplored. In this work, we propose CDTD, a Continuous Diffusion model for mixed-type Tabular Data. CDTD is based on a novel combination of score matching and score interpolation to enforce a unified continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical features. We explicitly acknowledge the necessity of homogenizing distinct data types by relying on model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes.To further address the high heterogeneity in mixed-type tabular data, we introduce adaptive feature- or type-specific noise schedules. These ensure balanced generative performance across features and optimize the allocation of model capacity across features and diffusion time. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts sample quality.

We conduct a comprehensive examination of the influence of the encoder, decoder, noise scheduler, and self-conditioning on zero-shot generation. Furthermore, we compare TEncDM with previous approaches on three conditional text generation tasks: QQP, XSum, and Wiki-Auto.

Diffusion models have emerged as superior alternatives to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) by addressing their limitations, such as training instability, mode collapse, and poor representation of multimodal distributions. This success has spurred widespread research interest. In the domain of tabular data, diffusion models have begun to showcase similar advantages over GANs and VAEs, achieving significant performance breakthroughs and demonstrating their potential for addressing unique challenges in tabular data modeling. However, while domains like images and time series have numerous surveys summarizing advancements in diffusion models, there remains a notable gap in the literature for tabular data. Despite the increasing interest in diffusion models for tabular data, there has been little effort to systematically review and summarize these developments. This lack of a dedicated survey limits a clear understanding of the challenges, progress, and future directions in this critical area. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of diffusion models for tabular data. Covering works from June 2015, when diffusion models emerged, to December 2024, we analyze nearly all relevant studies, with updates maintained in a \href{https://github.com/Diffusion-Model-Leiden/awesome-diffusion-models-for-tabular-data}{GitHub repository}.

Recent research has focused on developing detectors that generalize to unknown generators, with popular methods relying either on high-level features or low-level fingerprints.

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, SFLD, which incorporates PatchShuffle to integrate high-level semantic and low-level textural information. SFLD applies PatchShuffle at multiple levels, improving robustness and generalization across various generative models. Additionally, current benchmarks face challenges such as low image quality, insufficient content preservation, and limited class diversity. In response, we introduce TwinSynths, a new benchmark generation methodology that constructs visually near-identical pairs of real and synthetic images to ensure high quality and content preservation. Our extensive experiments and analysis show that SFLD outperforms existing methods on detecting a wide variety of fake images sourced from GANs, diffusion models, and TwinSynths, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance and generalization capabilities to novel generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF WACV 2025, Oral</p></details> |

Due to their ability to handle complex data distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers, modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models: high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models, and self-evolving and adaptive models.</p></details> |  |

Our results demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with higher-order statistics.

However, due to the needs of specific equipment and special application scenarios, the acquisition and annotation of hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often costly and time-consuming. To this end, our work explores the potential of generative diffusion model in synthesizing HSIs with pixel-level annotations. The main idea is to utilize a two-stream VAE to learn the latent representations of images and corresponding masks respectively, learn their joint distribution during the diffusion model training, and finally obtain the image and mask through their respective decoders. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to generate high-dimensional HSIs with annotations. Our proposed approach can be applied in various kinds of dataset generation. We select two of the most widely used dense prediction tasks: semantic segmentation and change detection, and generate datasets suitable for these tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our synthetic datasets have a positive impact on the improvement of these downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying LLMs to complex image generation can struggle with reconstructing the structure and details of the image, impacting the accuracy and stability of generation. Additionally, the 'next-token prediction' paradigm in the AR model does not align with the contextual scanning and logical reasoning processes involved in human visual perception, limiting effective image generation. Chain-of-Thought (CoT), as a key reasoning capability of LLMs, utilizes reasoning prompts to guide the model, improving reasoning performance on complex natural language process (NLP) tasks, enhancing accuracy and stability of generation, and helping the model maintain contextual coherence and logical consistency, similar to human reasoning. Inspired by CoT from the field of NLP, we propose autoregressive Image Generation with Thoughtful Reasoning (IGTR) to enhance autoregressive image generation. IGTR adds reasoning prompts without modifying the model structure or raster generation order. Specifically, we design specialized image-related reasoning prompts for AR image generation to simulate the human reasoning process, which enhances contextual reasoning by allowing the model to first perceive overall distribution information before generating the image, and improve generation stability by increasing the inference steps. Compared to the AR method without prompts, our method shows outstanding performance and achieves an approximate improvement of 20%.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2025</p></details> |

However, the accurate localization of anomalies in medical images remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of brain structures and the scarcity of annotated abnormal data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that incorporates masking within diffusion models, leveraging their generative capabilities to learn robust representations of normal brain anatomy. During training, our model processes only normal brain MRI scans and performs a forward diffusion process in the latent space that adds noise to the features of randomly-selected patches. Following a dual objective, the model learns to identify which patches are noisy and recover their original features. This strategy ensures that the model captures intricate patterns of normal brain structures while isolating potential anomalies as noise in the latent space. At inference, the model identifies noisy patches corresponding to anomalies and generates a normal counterpart for these patches by applying a reverse diffusion process. Our method surpasses existing unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, demonstrating superior performance in generating accurate normal counterparts and localizing anomalies.

| **[Ensembling Diffusion Models via Adaptive Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17082v2)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.17082v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of the text-guided diffusion model has inspired the development and release of numerous powerful diffusion models within the open-source community. These models are typically fine-tuned on various expert datasets, showcasing diverse denoising capabilities. Leveraging multiple high-quality models to produce stronger generation ability is valuable, but has not been extensively studied. Existing methods primarily adopt parameter merging strategies to produce a new static model. However, they overlook the fact that the divergent denoising capabilities of the models may dynamically change across different states, such as when experiencing different prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a novel ensembling method, Adaptive Feature Aggregation (AFA), which dynamically adjusts the contributions of multiple models at the feature level according to various states (i.e., prompts, initial noises, denoising steps, and spatial locations), thereby keeping the advantages of multiple diffusion models, while suppressing their disadvantages. Specifically, we design a lightweight Spatial-Aware Block-Wise (SABW) feature aggregator that adaptive aggregates the block-wise intermediate features from multiple U-Net denoisers into a unified one. The core idea lies in dynamically producing an individual attention map for each model's features by comprehensively considering various states. It is worth noting that only SABW is trainable with about 50 million parameters, while other models are frozen. Both the quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Adaptive Feature Aggregation method.</p></details> |  |

Despite the growing popularity of text-to-3D asset generation, its evaluation has not been well considered and studied. However, given the significant quality discrepancies among various text-to-3D assets, there is a pressing need for quality assessment models aligned with human subjective judgments. To tackle this challenge, we conduct a comprehensive study to explore the T23DA quality assessment (T23DAQA) problem in this work from both subjective and objective perspectives. Given the absence of corresponding databases, we first establish the largest text-to-3D asset quality assessment database to date, termed the AIGC-T23DAQA database. This database encompasses 969 validated 3D assets generated from 170 prompts via 6 popular text-to-3D asset generation models, and corresponding subjective quality ratings for these assets from the perspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence, respectively. Subsequently, we establish a comprehensive benchmark based on the AIGC-T23DAQA database, and devise an effective T23DAQA model to evaluate the generated 3D assets from the aforementioned three perspectives, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Adaptive Attention Modulation (AAM), a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations by analyzing and modulating the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models. We hypothesize that self-attention during early denoising steps may inadvertently amplify or suppress features, contributing to hallucinations. To counter this, AAM introduces a temperature scaling mechanism within the softmax operation of the self-attention layers, dynamically modulating the attention distribution during inference. Additionally, AAM employs a masked perturbation technique to disrupt early-stage noise that may otherwise propagate into later stages as hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AAM effectively reduces hallucinatory artifacts, enhancing both the fidelity and reliability of generated images. For instance, the proposed approach improves the FID score by 20.8% and reduces the percentage of hallucinated images by 12.9% (in absolute terms) on the Hands dataset.</p></details> |  |

While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. In this work, we attempt to discover EEG features that represent perceptual and semantic visual categories, using a simple pipeline. Notably, the high temporal resolution of EEG allows us to go beyond static semantic maps as obtained from fMRI. We show (a) Training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. (b) Mapping the decoded latents back to EEG using a linear encoder isolates CLIP-relevant EEG spatiotemporal features. (c) By using other latent spaces representing lower-level image features, we obtain similar time-courses of texture/hue-related information. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.</p></details> |  |

Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>add r...</summary><p>add results on reasoning and multimodality; add discussions on latest progress</p></details> |

While Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful method for sample-efficient optimization, it struggles with the curse of dimensionality and scaling to thousands of evaluations. Recently, leveraging generative models to solve black-box optimization problems has emerged as a promising framework. However, those methods often underperform compared to BO methods due to limited expressivity and difficulty of uncertainty estimation in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome these issues, we introduce \textbf{DiBO}, a novel framework for solving high-dimensional black-box optimization problems. Our method iterates two stages. First, we train a diffusion model to capture the data distribution and an ensemble of proxies to predict function values with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection as a posterior inference problem to balance exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional spaces. Concretely, we fine-tune diffusion models to amortize posterior inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various synthetic and real-world black-box optimization tasks.

Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.</p></details> |  |

While these diffusion models trained on large datasets have achieved success, there is often a need to introduce additional controls in downstream fine-tuning processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement $\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from intermediate states to additional controls.

Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models.

Brain inpainting offers a viable, although difficult, solution for tumor tissue processing, which is necessary to improve the precision of the diagnosis and treatment. Most conventional U-Net-based generative models, however, often face challenges in capturing the complex, nonlinear latent representations inherent in brain imaging. In order to accomplish high-quality healthy brain tissue reconstruction, this work proposes DiffKAN-Inpainting, an innovative method that blends diffusion models with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks architecture. During the denoising process, we introduce the RePaint method and tumor information to generate images with a higher fidelity and smoother margin. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed DiffKAN-Inpainting inpaints more detailed and realistic reconstructions on the BraTS dataset.

To predict a single output 3D pose sequence, we generate and aggregate multiple 3D pose hypotheses. For better aggregation results, we develop a method to score these hypotheses during training, effectively integrating conformal prediction into the learning process. This process results in a differentiable conformal predictor that is trained end2end with the 3D pose estimator. Post-training, the learned scoring model is used as the conformity score, and the 3D pose estimator is combined with a conformal predictor to select the most accurate hypotheses for downstream aggregation. Our results indicate that using a simple mean aggregation on the conformal prediction-filtered hypotheses set yields competitive results. When integrated with more sophisticated aggregation techniques, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics and datasets while inheriting the probabilistic guarantees of conformal prediction.</p></details> |  |

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) showed immense potential as a data preprocessing technique that generates good quality synthetic data. This study employs a systematic mapping methodology to analyze 3041 papers on GAN-based sampling techniques for imbalanced data sourced from four digital libraries. A filtering process identified 100 key studies spanning domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, this research introduces three categorization mappings as application domains, GAN techniques, and GAN variants used to handle the imbalanced nature of the data. GAN-based over-sampling emerges as an effective preprocessing method. Advanced architectures and tailored frameworks helped GANs to improve further in the case of data imbalance. GAN variants like vanilla GAN, CTGAN, and CGAN show great adaptability in structured imbalanced data cases. Interest in GANs for imbalanced data has grown tremendously, touching a peak in recent years, with journals and conferences playing crucial roles in transmitting foundational theories and practical applications. While with these advances, none of the reviewed studies explicitly explore hybridized GAN frameworks with diffusion models or reinforcement learning techniques.

However, most existing approaches represent the coupled temporal patterns, often neglecting the distinction between its specific components. In particular, fluctuating patterns and smooth trends within time series exhibit distinct characteristics. In this work, to model complicated temporal patterns, we propose a Conditional Denoising Polynomial Modeling (CDPM) framework, where probabilistic diffusion models and deterministic linear models are trained end-to-end. Instead of modeling the coupled time series, CDPM decomposes it into trend and seasonal components for modeling them separately. To capture the fluctuating seasonal component, we employ a probabilistic diffusion model based on statistical properties from the historical window. For the smooth trend component, a module is proposed to enhance linear models by incorporating historical dependencies, thereby preserving underlying trends and mitigating noise distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the potential of combining probabilistic and deterministic models.

To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality generations can be achieved with just 1-2 sampling steps, and further improvements can be obtained by adding additional steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pretrained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the sample quality with rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID (Frechet Inceptio Distance) of 22.1, surpassing that (23.4) of the 1-step InstaFlow (Liu et al., 2023) and matching that of 4-step UFOGen (Xue et al., 2023b). Moreover, SCott can yield more diverse samples than other consistency models for high-resolution image generation (Luo et al., 2023a), with up to 16% improvement in a qualified metric.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are essential for synthesizing large-scale high-quality paired rainy-clean image datasets, which can train deep learning-based single image rain removal models capable of generalizing to various illumination conditions. Therefore, we propose a practical two-stage learning-from-rendering pipeline for high-resolution rainy image synthesis. The pipeline combines the benefits of the realism of rendering-based methods and the high-efficiency of learning-based methods, providing the possibility of creating large-scale high-quality paired rainy-clean image datasets. In the rendering stage, we use a rendering-based method to create a High-resolution Rainy Image (HRI) dataset, which contains realistic high-resolution paired rainy-clean images of multiple scenes and various illumination conditions. In the learning stage, to learn illumination information from background images for high-resolution rainy image generation, we propose a High-resolution Rainy Image Generation Network (HRIGNet). HRIGNet is designed to introduce a guiding diffusion model in the Latent Diffusion Model, which provides additional guidance information for high-resolution image synthesis. In our experiments, HRIGNet is able to synthesize high-resolution rainy images up to 2048x1024 resolution. Rain removal experiments on real dataset validate that our method can help improve the robustness of deep derainers to real rainy images.

Typically, generative models learn a trajectory between the starting noise distribution and the target data distribution. Recently Liu et al. (2023b) designed a novel alternative generative model Rectified Flow (RF), which aims to learn straight flow trajectories from noise to data using a sequence of convex optimization problems with close ties to optimal transport. If the trajectory is curved, one must use many Euler discretization steps or novel strategies, such as exponential integrators, to achieve a satisfactory generation quality. In contrast, RF has been shown to theoretically straighten the trajectory through successive rectifications, reducing the number of function evaluations (NFEs) while sampling. It has also been shown empirically that RF may improve the straightness in two rectifications if one can solve the underlying optimization problem within a sufficiently small error. In this paper, we make two key theoretical contributions: 1) we provide the first theoretical analysis of the Wasserstein distance between the sampling distribution of RF and the target distribution. Our error rate is characterized by the number of discretization steps and a \textit{new formulation of straightness} stronger than that in the original work. 2) under a mild regularity assumption, we show that for a rectified flow from a Gaussian to any general target distribution with finite first moment (e.g. mixture of Gaussians), two rectifications are sufficient to achieve a straight flow, which is in line with the previous empirical findings. Additionally, we also present empirical results on both simulated and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks. Through our experiments, we illustrate the efficiency of the learning strategy and achieve state-of-the-art performance on classification tasks in the quantum noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any undesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether training-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side, i.e. texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to limitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image content. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the output side, i.e. generated images, may be more direct and effective, we propose to check concepts based on intermediate-generated images and correct them in the remainder of the generation process. Two key challenges are identified, i.e. determining the presence of target concepts during generation and replacing them on the fly. Leveraging the generation mechanism of diffusion models, we present the Concept Corrector, which incorporates the Generation Check Mechanism and the Concept Removal Attention. This method can identify the generated features associated with target concepts and replace them using pre-defined negative prompts, thereby achieving concept erasure. It requires no changes to model parameters and only relies on a given concept name and its replacement content. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure method based on intermediate-generated images. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its impressive erasure performance.

Stable Diffusion, a powerful diffusion model, enables the creation of high-resolution images with intricate details from text prompts or reference images. An intriguing challenge lies in improving performance for small datasets with image-sparse categories. This study explores the effectiveness of Stable Diffusion by evaluating seven common categories and three widespread weed species. Synthetic images were generated using three Stable Diffusion-based techniques: Image-to-Image Translation, DreamBooth, and ControlNet, each with distinct focuses. Classification and detection tasks were then performed on these synthetic images, and their performance was compared to models trained on original images. Promising results were achieved for certain classes, demonstrating the potential of Stable Diffusion in enhancing image-sparse datasets. This foundational study may accelerate the adaptation of diffusion models across various domains.</p></details> |  |

Instruct-NeRF2NeRF (IN2N) introduces the success of diffusion into 3D scene editing through an "Iterative dataset update" (IDU) strategy. Though achieving fascinating results, IN2N suffers from problems of blurry backgrounds and trapping in local optima. The first problem is caused by IN2N's lack of efficient guidance for background maintenance, while the second stems from the interaction between image editing and NeRF training during IDU. In this work, we introduce DualNeRF to deal with these problems. We propose a dual-field representation to preserve features of the original scene and utilize them as additional guidance to the model for background maintenance during IDU. Moreover, a simulated annealing strategy is embedded into IDU to endow our model with the power of addressing local optima issues. A CLIP-based consistency indicator is used to further improve the editing quality by filtering out low-quality edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the system with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency.

Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80% and 70% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, the widespread use of personalized generative models raises significant concerns regarding privacy violations and copyright infringement. To address these issues, researchers have proposed adversarial perturbation-based protection techniques. However, these methods have notable limitations, including insufficient robustness against data transformations and the inability to fully eliminate identifiable features of protected objects in the generated output. In this paper, we introduce PersGuard, a novel backdoor-based approach that prevents malicious personalization of specific images. Unlike traditional adversarial perturbation methods, PersGuard implant backdoor triggers into pre-trained T2I models, preventing the generation of customized outputs for designated protected images while allowing normal personalization for unprotected ones. Unfortunately, existing backdoor methods for T2I diffusion models fail to be applied to personalization scenarios due to the different backdoor objectives and the potential backdoor elimination during downstream fine-tuning processes. To address these, we propose three novel backdoor objectives specifically designed for personalization scenarios, coupled with backdoor retention loss engineered to resist downstream fine-tuning. These components are integrated into a unified optimization framework. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate PersGuard's effectiveness in preserving data privacy, even under challenging conditions including gray-box settings, multi-object protection, and facial identity scenarios. Our method significantly outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust solution for privacy and copyright protection.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation emerges as a crucial technique to mitigate this limitation. In this study, we introduce an efficient data augmentation method for pathology images, called USegMix. Given a set of pathology images, the proposed method generates a new, synthetic image in two phases. In the first phase, USegMix constructs a pool of tissue segments in an automated and unsupervised manner using superpixels and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In the second phase, USegMix selects a candidate segment in a target image, replaces it with a similar segment from the segment pool, and blends them by using a pre-trained diffusion model. In this way, USegMix can generate diverse and realistic pathology images. We rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of USegMix on two pathology image datasets of colorectal and prostate cancers. The results demonstrate improvements in cancer classification performance, underscoring the substantial potential of USegMix for pathology image analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for synthetic data generation differ significantly in their ability to maintain statistical fidelity, utility for classification tasks, and class balance. This study presents a comparative analysis of twelve synthetic network traffic data generation methods, encompassing non-AI (statistical), classical AI, and generative AI techniques. Using NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017 datasets, we evaluate the fidelity, utility, class balance, and scalability of these methods under standardized performance metrics. Results demonstrate that GAN-based models, particularly CTGAN and CopulaGAN, achieve superior fidelity and utility, making them ideal for high-quality synthetic data generation. Statistical methods such as SMOTE and Cluster Centroid effectively maintain class balance but fail to capture complex traffic structures. Meanwhile, diffusion models exhibit computational inefficiencies, limiting their scalability. Our findings provide a structured benchmarking framework for selecting the most suitable synthetic data generation techniques for network traffic analysis and cybersecurity applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate an image and a panoptic segmentation of objects and stuff from the prompt. Incorporating an inherent understanding of shapes and scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. We propose a Multi-Scale Patching mechanism to generate high-resolution segmentation maps. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</p></details> |  |

However, these generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures. Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly evolving landscape of generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

To accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation, which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current state-of-the-art one-step generation performance on ImageNet64 and zero-shot text-to-image generation on MS-COCO.

Specifically, we formulate the single-view-based 3D human novel view and pose synthesis as a single-view-conditioned human diffusion process, utilizing generative priors from foundational diffusion models to complement the missing information. To ensure fine-grained and consistent novel view and pose synthesis, we introduce a Human NeRF module in HumanGif to learn spatially aligned features from the input image, implicitly capturing the relative camera and human pose transformation. Furthermore, we introduce an image-level loss during optimization to bridge the gap between latent and image spaces in diffusion models. Extensive experiments on RenderPeople and DNA-Rendering datasets demonstrate that HumanGif achieves the best perceptual performance, with better generalizability for novel view and pose synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://skhu101.github.io/HumanGif/</p></details> |

In response to this, we propose a novel Latent REconstruction error guided feature REfinement method (LaRE^2) for detecting the diffusion-generated images. We come up with the Latent Reconstruction Error (LaRE), the first reconstruction-error based feature in the latent space for generated image detection. LaRE surpasses existing methods in terms of feature extraction efficiency while preserving crucial cues required to differentiate between the real and the fake. To exploit LaRE, we propose an Error-Guided feature REfinement module (EGRE), which can refine the image feature guided by LaRE to enhance the discriminativeness of the feature. Our EGRE utilizes an align-then-refine mechanism, which effectively refines the image feature for generated-image detection from both spatial and channel perspectives.

However, little progress has been made for optimal combinatorial auctions (CAs), even for the single bidder case, because we need to overcome the challenge of the bundle space growing exponentially with the number of items. For example, when learning a menu of allocation-price choices for a bidder in a CA, each menu element needs to efficiently and flexibly specify a probability distribution on bundles. In this paper, we solve this problem in the single-bidder CA setting by generating a bundle distribution through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) applied to a tractable initial distribution, drawing inspiration from generative models, especially score-based diffusion models and continuous normalizing flow. Our method, BundleFlow, uses deep learning to find suitable ODE-based transforms of initial distributions, one transform for each menu element, so that the overall menu achieves high expected revenue. Our method achieves 1.11$-$2.23$\times$ higher revenue compared with automated mechanism design baselines on the single-bidder version of CATS, a standard CA testbed, and scales to problems with up to 150 items. Relative to a baseline that also learns allocations in menu elements, our method reduces the training iterations by 3.6$-$9.5$\times$ and cuts training time by about 80% in settings with 50 and 100 items.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose CopyJudge, an automated copyright infringement identification framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework with multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide detailed judgment rationales. Based on the judgments, we further introduce a general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing content. Besides, our approach can be enhanced by exploring non-infringing noise vectors within the diffusion latent space via reinforcement learning, even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of infringement, and that our mitigation method could more effectively mitigate memorization and IP infringement without losing non-infringing expressions.</p></details> | 17pages, 8 figures |

However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a dice coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8\% and 18.6\% improvements in DICE and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM</p></details> |

These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |

While recent advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation on Kinetics-700 17x256x256.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 22 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The core idea behind DC-ControlNet is to decouple control conditions, transforming global control into a hierarchical system that integrates distinct elements, contents, and layouts. This enables users to mix these individual conditions with greater flexibility, leading to more efficient and accurate image generation control. Previous ControlNet-based models rely solely on global conditions, which affect the entire image and lack the ability of element- or region-specific control. This limitation reduces flexibility and can cause condition misunderstandings in multi-conditional image generation. To address these challenges, we propose both intra-element and Inter-element Controllers in DC-ControlNet. The Intra-Element Controller handles different types of control signals within individual elements, accurately describing the content and layout characteristics of the object. For interactions between elements, we introduce the Inter-Element Controller, which accurately handles multi-element interactions and occlusion based on user-defined relationships. Extensive evaluations show that DC-ControlNet significantly outperforms existing ControlNet models and Layout-to-Image generative models in terms of control flexibility and precision in multi-condition control.</p></details> |  |

One key aspect of creating such models is employing 2D conflict maps that detect openings' locations in building facades. Yet, in reality, these maps are often incomplete due to obstacles encountered during laser scanning. To address this challenge, we introduce FacaDiffy, a novel method for inpainting unseen facade parts by completing conflict maps with a personalized Stable Diffusion model. Specifically, we first propose a deterministic ray analysis approach to derive 2D conflict maps from existing 3D building models and corresponding laser scanning point clouds. Furthermore, we facilitate the inpainting of unseen facade objects into these 2D conflict maps by leveraging the potential of personalizing a Stable Diffusion model. To complement the scarcity of real-world training data, we also develop a scalable pipeline to produce synthetic conflict maps using random city model generators and annotated facade images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FacaDiffy achieves state-of-the-art performance in conflict map completion compared to various inpainting baselines and increases the detection rate by $22\%$ when applying the completed conflict maps for high-definition 3D semantic building reconstruction.

Most existing solutions accelerate the sampling process by proposing fast ODE solvers. However, the inevitable discretization errors of the ODE solvers are significantly magnified when the number of function evaluations (NFE) is fewer. In this work, we propose PFDiff, a novel training-free and orthogonal timestep-skipping strategy, which enables existing fast ODE solvers to operate with fewer NFE. Specifically, PFDiff initially utilizes score replacement from past time steps to predict a ``springboard". Subsequently, it employs this ``springboard" along with foresight updates inspired by Nesterov momentum to rapidly update current intermediate states. This approach effectively reduces unnecessary NFE while correcting for discretization errors inherent in first-order ODE solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that PFDiff exhibits flexible applicability across various pre-trained DPMs, particularly excelling in conditional DPMs and surpassing previous state-of-the-art training-free methods. For instance, using DDIM as a baseline, we achieved 16.46 FID (4 NFE) compared to 138.81 FID with DDIM on ImageNet 64x64 with classifier guidance, and 13.06 FID (10 NFE) on Stable Diffusion with 7.5 guidance scale.

Whereas recent approaches to addressing PO have appealed to deep learning models, providing a rigorous understanding of how these models and their approximation errors affect agents' handling of PO and their interactions remain a challenge. In addressing this challenge, we investigate reconstructing global states from local action-observation histories in Dec-POMDPs using diffusion models. We first find that diffusion models conditioned on local history represent possible states as stable fixed points. In collectively observable (CO) Dec-POMDPs, individual diffusion models conditioned on agents' local histories share a unique fixed point corresponding to the global state, while in non-CO settings, shared fixed points yield a distribution of possible states given joint history. We further find that, with deep learning approximation errors, fixed points can deviate from true states and the deviation is negatively correlated to the Jacobian rank. Inspired by this low-rank property, we bound a deviation by constructing a surrogate linear regression model that approximates the local behavior of a diffusion model. With this bound, we propose a \emph{composite diffusion process} iterating over agents with theoretical convergence guarantees to the true state.</p></details> |  |

However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing. Data and evaluator are released under https://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety.</p></details> |  |

This perspective allows us to implement efficient and principled particle Gibbs and pseudo-marginal samplers marginally targeting the conditional distribution $\pi(x \mid y)$. Contrary to existing methodology, our methods do not introduce any additional approximation to the unconditional diffusion model aside from the Monte Carlo error.

This is important for creative applications like visual effects in filmmaking. Previous methods rely on establishing point-to-point correspondences and determining smooth deformation trajectories, which inherently restrict them to shape-only morphing on untextured, topologically aligned datasets. This restriction leads to labor-intensive preprocessing and poor generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method for 3D regenerative morphing using a 3D diffusion prior. Unlike previous methods that depend on explicit correspondences and deformations, our method eliminates the additional need for obtaining correspondence and uses the 3D diffusion prior to generate morphing. Specifically, we introduce a 3D diffusion model and interpolate the source and target information at three levels: initial noise, model parameters, and condition features. We then explore an Attention Fusion strategy to generate more smooth morphing sequences. To further improve the plausibility of semantic interpolation and the generated 3D surfaces, we propose two strategies: (a) Token Reordering, where we match approximate tokens based on semantic analysis to guide implicit correspondences in the denoising process of the diffusion model, and (b) Low-Frequency Enhancement, where we enhance low-frequency signals in the tokens to improve the quality of generated surfaces. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior smoothness and plausibility in 3D morphing across diverse cross-category object pairs, offering a novel regenerative method for 3D morphing with textured representations.</p></details> |  |

Notably, the typical training objective of diffusion models, i.e., denoising score matching, has a closed-form optimal solution that can only generate training data replicating samples. This indicates that a memorization behavior is theoretically expected, which contradicts the common generalization ability of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and thus calls for a deeper understanding. Looking into this, we first observe that memorization behaviors tend to occur on smaller-sized datasets, which motivates our definition of effective model memorization (EMM), a metric measuring the maximum size of training data at which a learned diffusion model approximates its theoretical optimum. Then, we quantify the impact of the influential factors on these memorization behaviors in terms of EMM, focusing primarily on data distribution, model configuration, and training procedure. Besides comprehensive empirical results identifying the influential factors, we surprisingly find that conditioning training data on uninformative random labels can significantly trigger the memorization in diffusion models. Our study holds practical significance for diffusion model users and offers clues to theoretical research in deep generative models.

To address this challenge, we introduce 3D-Adapter, a plug-in module designed to infuse 3D geometry awareness into pretrained image diffusion models. Central to our approach is the idea of 3D feedback augmentation: for each denoising step in the sampling loop, 3D-Adapter decodes intermediate multi-view features into a coherent 3D representation, then re-encodes the rendered RGBD views to augment the pretrained base model through feature addition.

We introduce DMOSpeech, a distilled diffusion-based TTS model that uniquely achieves both faster inference and superior performance compared to its teacher model. By enabling direct gradient pathways to all model components, we demonstrate the first successful end-to-end optimization of differentiable metrics in TTS, incorporating Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and Speaker Verification (SV) loss. Our comprehensive experiments, validated through extensive human evaluation, show significant improvements in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity while reducing inference time by orders of magnitude.

Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

Therefore, obtaining diverse samples with strong reward signals is crucial for improving sample efficiency and overall performance. In this work, we introduce DiffExp, a simple yet effective exploration strategy for reward fine-tuning of text-to-image models. Our approach employs two key strategies: (a) dynamically adjusting the scale of classifier-free guidance to enhance sample diversity, and (b) randomly weighting phrases of the text prompt to exploit high-quality reward signals. We demonstrate that these strategies significantly enhance exploration during online sample generation, improving the sample efficiency of recent reward fine-tuning methods, such as DDPO and AlignProp.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Modern computational approaches now aim to emulate this fundamental creative process. Although recent diffusion models excel at text-guided compositional synthesis, text as a medium often lacks precise control over visual details. Image-based composition approaches can capture more nuanced features, but existing methods are typically limited in the range of concepts they can capture, and require expensive training procedures or specialized data. We present IP-Composer, a novel training-free approach for compositional image generation that leverages multiple image references simultaneously, while using natural language to describe the concept to be extracted from each image. Our method builds on IP-Adapter, which synthesizes novel images conditioned on an input image's CLIP embedding. We extend this approach to multiple visual inputs by crafting composite embeddings, stitched from the projections of multiple input images onto concept-specific CLIP-subspaces identified through text. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach enables more precise control over a larger range of visual concept compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ip-composer.github.io/IP-Composer/</p></details> |

Typically, sampling from a diffusion model involves using a denoising distribution characterized by a Gaussian with a learned mean and either fixed or learned covariances. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed covariance moment matching technique and introduce a novel method for learning the diagonal covariance. Unlike traditional data-driven diagonal covariance approximation approaches, our method involves directly regressing the optimal diagonal analytic covariance using a new, unbiased objective named Optimal Covariance Matching (OCM). This approach can significantly reduce the approximation error in covariance prediction. We demonstrate how our method can substantially enhance the sampling efficiency, recall rate and likelihood of commonly used diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time.

However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</p></details> |  |

However, for large datasets and complex deep networks (e.g., ImageNet-1K with ResNet-101), the extensive optimization space limits performance, reducing its practicality. Recent approaches employ pre-trained diffusion models to generate informative images directly, avoiding pixel-level optimization and achieving notable results. However, these methods often face challenges due to distribution shifts between pre-trained models and target datasets, along with the need for multiple distillation steps across varying settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework orthogonal to existing diffusion-based distillation methods, leveraging diffusion models for selection rather than generation. Our method starts by predicting noise generated by the diffusion model based on input images and text prompts (with or without label text), then calculates the corresponding loss for each pair. With the loss differences, we identify distinctive regions of the original images. Additionally, we perform intra-class clustering and ranking on selected patches to maintain diversity constraints. This streamlined framework enables a single-step distillation process, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, open-source alternatives, such as StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion, offer comparable capabilities. These open-source models, hosted on Hugging Face, come equipped with ethical filter protections designed to prevent the generation of explicit images. This paper reveals first their limitations and then presents a novel text-based safety filter that outperforms existing solutions. Our research is driven by the critical need to address the misuse of AI-generated content, especially in the context of information warfare. DiffGuard enhances filtering efficacy, achieving a performance that surpasses the best existing filters by over 14%.</p></details> |  |

Generative models, such as diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable success in overcoming many limitations of traditional statistical methods. Shen and Meinshausen (2024) introduced engression, a generative approach based on scoring rules that maps noise (and covariates, if available) directly to data. While effective, engression struggles with highly complex distributions, such as those encountered in image data. In this work, we extend engression to improve its capability in learning complex distributions. We propose a framework that defines a general forward process transitioning from the target distribution to a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) and then learns a reverse Markov process using multiple engression models. This reverse process reconstructs the target distribution step by step. Our approach supports general forward processes, allows for dimension reduction, and naturally discretizes the generative process. As a special case, when using a diffusion-based forward process, our framework offers a method to discretize the training and inference of diffusion models efficiently. Empirical evaluations on simulated and climate data validate our theoretical insights, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complex distributions.</p></details> |  |

Generating high-quality realistic images from user-specified rough hand-drawn sketches is one such task that aims to impose a structural constraint on the conditional generation process. While the premise is intriguing for numerous use cases of content creation and academic research, the problem becomes fundamentally challenging due to substantial ambiguities in freehand sketches. Furthermore, balancing the trade-off between shape consistency and realistic generation contributes to additional complexity in the process. Existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generally utilize conditional GANs or GAN inversions, often requiring application-specific data and optimization objectives. The recent introduction of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieves a generational leap for low-level visual attributes in general image synthesis. However, directly retraining a large-scale diffusion model on a domain-specific subtask is often extremely difficult due to demanding computation costs and insufficient data. In this paper, we introduce a technique for sketch-to-image translation by exploiting the feature generalization capabilities of a large-scale diffusion model without retraining. In particular, we use a learnable lightweight mapping network to achieve latent feature translation from source to target domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques in qualitative and quantitative benchmarks, allowing high-resolution realistic image synthesis from rough hand-drawn sketches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |

Unlike existing texture generation techniques that use ad hoc backprojection and averaging schemes to blend multiview images into textures, often resulting in texture seams and artifacts, our approach employs a trained, feedforward neural module to boost texture coherency. The key ingredient of our module is to leverage neural attention and appropriate positional encodings of image pixels based on their corresponding 3D point positions, normals, and surface-aware coordinates as encoded in geodesic distances within surface patches. These encodings capture texture correlations between neighboring surface points, ensuring better texture continuity. Experimental results show that our module improves texture quality, achieving superior performance in high-resolution texture generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing computational approaches to conditional sampling within generative diffusion models. Specifically, we highlight key methodologies that either utilise the joint distribution, or rely on (pre-trained) marginal distributions with explicit likelihoods, to construct conditional generative samplers.</p></details> |  |

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

The completeness and accuracy of visual perception significantly influence the precision of spatial reasoning, fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. However, MLLM still lacks the autonomous capability to control its own visual perception processes, for example, selectively reviewing specific regions of an image or focusing on information related to specific object categories. In this work, we propose the concept of Visual Perception Token, aiming to empower MLLM with a mechanism to control its visual perception processes. We design two types of Visual Perception Tokens, termed the Region Selection Token and the Vision Re-Encoding Token. MLLMs autonomously generate these tokens, just as they generate text, and use them to trigger additional visual perception actions. The Region Selection Token explicitly identifies specific regions in an image that require further perception, while the Vision Re-Encoding Token uses its hidden states as control signals to guide additional visual perception processes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of these tokens in handling spatial reasoning, improving fine-grained understanding, and other tasks. On average, the introduction of Visual Perception Tokens improves the performance of a 2B model by 23.6\%, increasing its score from 0.572 to 0.708, and even outperforms a 7B parameter model by 13.4\% (from 0.624).

Given their potential integration into many critical applications, it is important to understand the limitations of their visual perception. In this work, we study whether MLLMs can perceive small visual details as effectively as large ones when answering questions about images. We observe that their performance is very sensitive to the size of the visual subject of the question, and further show that this effect is in fact causal by conducting an intervention study. Next, we study the attention patterns of MLLMs when answering visual questions, and intriguingly find that they consistently know where to look, even when they provide the wrong answer. Based on these findings, we then propose training-free visual intervention methods that leverage the internal knowledge of any MLLM itself, in the form of attention and gradient maps, to enhance its perception of small visual details. We evaluate our proposed methods on two widely-used MLLMs and seven visual question answering benchmarks and show that they can significantly improve MLLMs' accuracy without requiring any training. Our results elucidate the risk of applying MLLMs to visual recognition tasks concerning small details and indicate that visual intervention using the model's internal state is a promising direction to mitigate this risk.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

Merging models into one universal model to empower multi-task ability refraining from data leakage has gained popularity. With the expansion in data and model size, parameter efficient tuning becomes the common practice for obtaining task-specific models efficiently. However, we observe that existing methods designed for full fine-tuning merging fail under efficient tuning. To address the issues, we analyze from low-rank decomposition and reveal that maintaining direction and compensating for gap between singular values are crucial for efficient model merging. Consequently, we propose CoPA-Merging, a training-free parameter efficient merging method with complementary parameter adaptation. Specifically, we (1) prune parameters and construct scaling coefficients from inter-parameter relation to compensate for performance drop from task interference and (2) perform cross-task normalization to enhance unseen task generalization. We establish a benchmark consisting of diverse multimodal tasks, on which we conduct experiments to certificate the outstanding performance and generalizability of our method. Additional study and extensive analyses further showcase the effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, MU for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains in its nascent phase. Therefore, we propose to reformulate the task of multimodal MU in the era of MLLMs, which aims to erase only the visual patterns associated with a given entity while preserving the corresponding textual knowledge encoded within the original parameters of the language model backbone. Furthermore, we develop a novel geometry-constrained gradient descent method MMUnlearner. It updates the weights of MLLMs with a weight saliency map jointly restricted by the remaining concepts and textual knowledge during unlearning, thereby preserving parameters essential for non-target knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMUnlearner surpasses baselines that finetuning MLLMs with VQA data directly through Gradient Ascent (GA) or Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), across all evaluation dimensions. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cardiovascular risk scores rely primarily on clinical data, often overlooking environmental influences like air pollution that significantly impact heart health. Moreover, integrating complex time-series environmental data with clinical records is challenging. We introduce TabulaTime, a multimodal deep learning framework that enhances ACS risk prediction by combining clinical risk factors with air pollution data. TabulaTime features three key innovations: First, it integrates time-series air pollution data with clinical tabular data to improve prediction accuracy. Second, its PatchRWKV module automatically extracts complex temporal patterns, overcoming limitations of traditional feature engineering while maintaining linear computational complexity. Third, attention mechanisms enhance interpretability by revealing interactions between clinical and environmental factors. Experimental results show that TabulaTime improves prediction accuracy by over 20% compared to conventional models such as CatBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, with air pollution data alone contributing over a 10% improvement. Feature importance analysis identifies critical predictors including previous angina, systolic blood pressure, PM10, and NO2. Overall, TabulaTime bridges clinical and environmental insights, supporting personalized prevention strategies and informing public health policies to mitigate ACS risk.</p></details> |  |

It evaluates Vision Language Models (VLMs) on two aligned tasks: a visual statement verification task, and an open-ended visual question-answering task, both on the same set of video-related questions. It considers twelve reasoning categories that aim to disentangle language and vision relations by highlight when one of two alone encodes sufficient information to solve the tasks, when they are both needed and when the full richness of the short video is essential instead of just a part of it. Thanks to its carefully taught design, it evaluates VLMs' consistency and visually grounded natural language comprehension and generation simultaneously through an aggregated metric.

The introduction of process supervision for CoT trajectories has sparked discussions on improving test-time scaling, thereby unlocking the System 2-style thinking capabilities of these models. However, in multimodal mathematical reasoning, the scarcity of high-quality CoT training data has hindered existing models from achieving both deliberate reasoning and fine-grained verification. In this work, we propose a novel framework that introduces System 2-style thinking to multimodal mathematical reasoning. We introduce a three-module CoT data synthesis process that integrates CoT distillation, trajectory-format rewriting, and format unification. This process generates MMathCoT-1M, a high-quality CoT reasoning instruction fine-tuning dataset. Furthermore, we implement a dual-view trajectory labeling automation that targets both visual grounding fidelity and deductive chain validity, resulting in the DualMath-1.1M dataset.

Abuse of this technology could pose significant risks to society, creating the urgent need for research into corresponding detection methods. However, research in this field has been hindered by the lack of public datasets. In this paper, we construct the first large-scale multi-scenario talking face dataset (MSTF), which contains 22 audio and video forgery techniques, filling the gap of datasets in this field. The dataset covers 11 generation scenarios and more than 20 semantic scenarios, closer to the practical application scenario of TFG. Besides, we also propose a TFG detection framework, which leverages the analysis of both global and local coherence in the multimodal content of TFG videos. Therefore, a region-focused smoothness detection module (RSFDM) and a discrepancy capture-time frame aggregation module (DCTAM) are introduced to evaluate the global temporal coherence of TFG videos, aggregating multi-grained spatial information. Additionally, a visual-audio fusion module (V-AFM) is designed to evaluate audiovisual coherence within a localized temporal perspective. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the reasonableness and challenges of our datasets, while also indicating the superiority of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art deepfake detection approaches.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods transfer visual/linguistic knowledge separately by fully fine-tuning uni-modal pre-trained models, followed by a simple stack of visual-language transformers for multimodal fusion. However, these approaches not only limit adequate interaction between visual and linguistic contexts, but also incur significant computational costs. Therefore, to address these issues, we explore a step-wise multimodal fusion and adaption framework, namely SwimVG. Specifically, SwimVG proposes step-wise multimodal prompts (Swip) and cross-modal interactive adapters (CIA) for visual grounding, replacing the cumbersome transformer stacks for multimodal fusion. Swip can improve {the} alignment between the vision and language representations step by step, in a token-level fusion manner. In addition, weight-level CIA further promotes multimodal fusion by cross-modal interaction. Swip and CIA are both parameter-efficient paradigms, and they fuse the cross-modal features from shallow to deep layers gradually. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that SwimVG achieves remarkable abilities and considerable benefits in terms of efficiency.

However, this increased popularity brings challenges, such as road accidents and conflicts when sharing space with traditional transport modes. An in-depth understanding of e-scooter rider behaviour is crucial for ensuring rider safety, guiding infrastructure planning, and enforcing traffic rules. This study investigated the rider behaviour through a naturalistic study with 23 participants equipped with a bike computer, eye-tracking glasses and cameras. They followed a pre-determined route, enabling multi-modal data collection. We analysed and compared gaze movements, speed, and video feeds across three transport infrastructure types: a pedestrian-shared path, a cycle lane and a roadway. Our findings reveal unique challenges e-scooter riders face, including difficulty keeping up with cyclists and motor vehicles due to speed limits on shared e-scooters, risks in signalling turns due to control lose, and limited acceptance in mixed-use spaces. The cycle lane showed the highest average speed, the least speed change points, and the least head movements, supporting its suitability as dedicated infrastructure for e-scooters. These findings are facilitated through multimodal sensing and analysing the e-scooter riders' ego-centric view, which show the efficacy of our method in discovering the behavioural dynamics of the riders in the wild. Our study highlights the critical need to align infrastructure with user behaviour to improve safety and emphasises the importance of targeted safety measures and regulations, especially when e-scooter riders share spaces with pedestrians or motor vehicles.

We investigate how extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills of underlying LLMs influence this strong performance. Surprisingly, we discover that LLM-based approaches can yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks with limited video information, sometimes even with no video specific information. Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks. Strong performance also on robotics domain tasks establish its strong generality.

However, it is often hindered by the multimodal imbalance problem, where certain modality dominates while others remain underutilized. Although recent studies have proposed various methods to alleviate this problem, they lack comprehensive and fair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically categorize various mainstream multimodal imbalance algorithms into four groups based on the strategies they employ to mitigate imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a benchmark including multiple widely used multidimensional datasets and evaluation metrics from three perspectives: performance, imbalance degree, and complexity. To ensure fair comparisons, we have developed a modular and extensible toolkit that standardizes the experimental workflow across different methods. Based on the experiments using BalanceBenchmark, we have identified several key insights into the characteristics and advantages of different method groups in terms of performance, balance degree and computational complexity. We expect such analysis could inspire more efficient approaches to address the imbalance problem in the future, as well as foundation models.

| **[A Causality-aware Paradigm for Evaluating Creativity of Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15147v2)** | 2025-02-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15147v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, assessing the equally important creative capabilities of LLMs is challenging due to the subjective, diverse, and data-scarce nature of creativity, especially in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we consider the comprehensive pipeline for evaluating the creativity of multimodal LLMs, with a focus on suitable evaluation platforms and methodologies. First, we find the Oogiri game, a creativity-driven task requiring humor, associative thinking, and the ability to produce unexpected responses to text, images, or both. This game aligns well with the input-output structure of modern multimodal LLMs and benefits from a rich repository of high-quality, human-annotated creative responses, making it an ideal platform for studying LLM creativity. Next, beyond using the Oogiri game for standard evaluations like ranking and selection, we propose LoTbench, an interactive, causality-aware evaluation framework, to further address some intrinsic risks in standard evaluations, such as information leakage and limited interpretability. The proposed LoTbench not only quantifies LLM creativity more effectively but also visualizes the underlying creative thought processes. Our results show that while most LLMs exhibit constrained creativity, the performance gap between LLMs and humans is not insurmountable. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between results from the multimodal cognition benchmark MMMU and LoTbench, but only a weak connection with traditional creativity metrics. This suggests that LoTbench better aligns with human cognitive theories, highlighting cognition as a critical foundation in the early stages of creativity and enabling the bridging of diverse concepts. https://lotbench.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.02439</p></details> |

Existing open-vocabulary detectors are limited by complex visual-textual misalignment and long-tailed category imbalances, leading to suboptimal performance in challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{MQADet}, a universal paradigm for enhancing existing open-vocabulary detectors by leveraging the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MQADet functions as a plug-and-play solution that integrates seamlessly with pre-trained object detectors without substantial additional training costs. Specifically, we design a novel three-stage Multimodal Question Answering (MQA) pipeline to guide the MLLMs to precisely localize complex textual and visual targets while effectively enhancing the focus of existing object detectors on relevant objects. To validate our approach, we present a new benchmark for evaluating our paradigm on four challenging open-vocabulary datasets, employing three state-of-the-art object detectors as baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed paradigm significantly improves the performance of existing detectors, particularly in unseen complex categories, across diverse and challenging scenarios. To facilitate future research, we will publicly release our code.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce VisFactor, a novel benchmark derived from the Factor-Referenced Cognitive Test (FRCT), a well-established psychometric assessment of human cognition. VisFactor digitalizes vision-related FRCT subtests to systematically evaluate MLLMs across essential visual cognitive tasks including spatial reasoning, perceptual speed, and pattern recognition. We present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Qwen-VL, using VisFactor under diverse prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought and Multi-Agent Debate. Our findings reveal a concerning deficiency in current MLLMs' fundamental visual cognition, with performance frequently approaching random guessing and showing only marginal improvements even with advanced prompting techniques. These results underscore the critical need for focused research to enhance the core visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. To foster further investigation in this area, we release our VisFactor benchmark at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/VisFactor.</p></details> | Working in Progress |

While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task. These insights can help practitioners determine whether increasing alignment between modalities is advantageous or, in some cases, detrimental to achieving optimal performance.

While various methods have been proposed to tackle the complexities of VsTP, existing solutions often rely on task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks. This leads to modal isolation and complex workflows due to the diversified targets and heterogeneous schemas. In this paper, we introduce OmniParser V2, a universal model that unifies VsTP typical tasks, including text spotting, key information extraction, table recognition, and layout analysis, into a unified framework. Central to our approach is the proposed Structured-Points-of-Thought (SPOT) prompting schemas, which improves model performance across diverse scenarios by leveraging a unified encoder-decoder architecture, objective, and input\&output representation. SPOT eliminates the need for task-specific architectures and loss functions, significantly simplifying the processing pipeline. Our extensive evaluations across four tasks on eight different datasets show that OmniParser V2 achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results in VsTP. Additionally, we explore the integration of SPOT within a multimodal large language model structure, further enhancing text localization and recognition capabilities, thereby confirming the generality of SPOT prompting technique.

| **[Generating with Fairness: A Modality-Diffused Counterfactual Framework for Incomplete Multimodal Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11916v4)** | 2025-02-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11916v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete scenario is a prevalent, practical, yet challenging setting in Multimodal Recommendations (MMRec), where some item modalities are missing due to various factors. Recently, a few efforts have sought to improve the recommendation accuracy by exploring generic structures from incomplete data. However, two significant gaps persist: 1) the difficulty in accurately generating missing data due to the limited ability to capture modality distributions; and 2) the critical but overlooked visibility bias, where items with missing modalities are more likely to be disregarded due to the prioritization of items' multimodal data over user preference alignment. This bias raises serious concerns about the fair treatment of items. To bridge these two gaps, we propose a novel Modality-Diffused Counterfactual (MoDiCF) framework for incomplete multimodal recommendations. MoDiCF features two key modules: a novel modality-diffused data completion module and a new counterfactual multimodal recommendation module. The former, equipped with a particularly designed multimodal generative framework, accurately generates and iteratively refines missing data from learned modality-specific distribution spaces. The latter, grounded in the causal perspective, effectively mitigates the negative causal effects of visibility bias and thus assures fairness in recommendations. Both modules work collaboratively to address the two aforementioned significant gaps for generating more accurate and fair results. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MoDiCF in terms of both recommendation accuracy and fairness. The code and processed datasets are released at https://github.com/JinLi-i/MoDiCF.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

We investigated how this emerging paradigm of visual assistance transforms how PVI perform and manage their daily tasks. Moving beyond usability assessments, we examined both the capabilities and limitations of LMM-based tools in personal and social contexts, while exploring design implications for their future development. Through interviews with 14 visually impaired users of Be My AI (an LMM-based application) and analysis of its image descriptions from both study participants and social media platforms, we identified two key limitations. First, these systems' context awareness suffers from hallucinations and misinterpretations of social contexts, styles, and human identities. Second, their intent-oriented capabilities often fail to grasp and act on users' intentions. Based on these findings, we propose design strategies for improving both human-AI and AI-AI interactions, contributing to the development of more effective, interactive, and personalized assistive technologies.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. We also explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting inconsistencies confined to a single modality, particularly in text, but struggle with cross-modal conflicts and complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, multi-agent models have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in a multi-agent interaction setting for the novel task of multicultural image generation. Our key contributions are: (1) We introduce MosAIG, a Multi-Agent framework that enhances multicultural Image Generation by leveraging LLMs with distinct cultural personas; (2) We provide a dataset of 9,000 multicultural images spanning five countries, three age groups, two genders, 25 historical landmarks, and five languages; and (3) We demonstrate that multi-agent interactions outperform simple, no-agent models across multiple evaluation metrics, offering valuable insights for future research.

To systematically examine visual-mathematical reasoning in MLLMs, we (1) evaluate their understanding of geometric primitives, (2) test multi-step reasoning, and (3) explore a potential solution to improve visual reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental shortcomings in shape recognition, with top models achieving under 50% accuracy in identifying regular polygons. We analyze these failures through the lens of dual-process theory and show that MLLMs rely on System 1 (intuitive, memorized associations) rather than System 2 (deliberate reasoning). Consequently, MLLMs fail to count the sides of both familiar and novel shapes, suggesting they have neither learned the concept of sides nor effectively process visual inputs. Finally, we propose Visually Cued Chain-of-Thought (VC-CoT) prompting, which enhances multi-step mathematical reasoning by explicitly referencing visual annotations in diagrams, boosting GPT-4o's accuracy on an irregular polygon side-counting task from 7% to 93%. Our findings suggest that System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, and visually-guided prompting is essential for successfully engaging visual reasoning.

While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, while these models achieve decent performance when applied in a frozen manner, surprisingly, due to significant domain gaps (e.g., feature distribution discrepancy and task objective misalignment) between pre-training and personalized recommendation, adopting a joint training approach instead leads to performance worse than baseline. Existing approaches either rely on simple feature extraction or require computationally expensive full model fine-tuning, struggling to balance effectiveness and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose \textbf{P}arameter-efficient \textbf{T}uning for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Rec}ommendation (\textbf{PTMRec}), a novel framework that bridges the domain gap between pre-trained models and recommendation systems through a knowledge-guided dual-stage parameter-efficient training strategy.

However, despite their ability to handle long inputs, generating outputs with corresponding levels of richness remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the issue of long outputs in LMMs using video captioning as a proxy task, and we find that open-source LMMs struggle to consistently generate outputs exceeding about 300 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the scarcity of paired examples with long-captions during training is the primary factor limiting the model's output length. However, manually annotating long-caption examples is time-consuming and expensive. To address this, we propose the LongCaption-Agent, a framework that synthesizes long caption data by aggregating multi-level descriptions. Using LongCaption-Agent, we curated a new long-caption dataset, LongCaption-10K. We also develop LongCaption-Bench, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the quality of long captions generated by LMMs. By incorporating LongCaption-10K into training, we enable LMMs to generate captions exceeding 1,000 words, while maintaining high output quality. In LongCaption-Bench, our 8B parameter model achieved state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing larger proprietary models.

The tasks aim to extract the structural information in free texts with the incorporate images, including: multimodal named entity typing and multimodal relation extraction. However, the growing number of multimodal data implies a growing category set and the newly emerged entity types or relations should be recognized without additional training. To address the aforementioned challenges, we focus on the zero-shot multimodal information extraction tasks which require using textual and visual modalities for recognizing unseen categories. Compared with text-based zero-shot information extraction models, the existing multimodal ones make the textual and visual modalities aligned directly and exploit various fusion strategies to improve their performances. But the existing methods ignore the fine-grained semantic correlation of text-image pairs and samples. Therefore, we propose the multimodal graph-based variational mixture of experts network (MG-VMoE) which takes the MoE network as the backbone and exploits it for aligning multimodal representations in a fine-grained way. Considering to learn informative representations of multimodal data, we design each expert network as a variational information bottleneck to process two modalities in a uni-backbone. Moreover, we also propose the multimodal graph-based virtual adversarial training to learn the semantic correlation between the samples. The experimental results on the two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MG-VMoE over the baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

Why can't large language models replicate this holistic understanding? Through a systematic analysis of existing training paradigms in vision-language-action models (VLA), we identify two key challenges: spurious forgetting, where robot training overwrites crucial visual-text alignments, and task interference, where competing control and understanding tasks degrade performance when trained jointly. To overcome these limitations, we propose ChatVLA, a novel framework featuring Phased Alignment Training, which incrementally integrates multimodal data after initial control mastery, and a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to minimize task interference. ChatVLA demonstrates competitive performance on visual question-answering datasets and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art vision-language-action (VLA) methods on multimodal understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves a six times higher performance on MMMU and scores 47.2% on MMStar with a more parameter-efficient design than ECoT. Furthermore, ChatVLA demonstrates superior performance on 25 real-world robot manipulation tasks compared to existing VLA methods like OpenVLA. Our findings highlight the potential of our unified framework for achieving both robust multimodal understanding and effective robot control.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

To address these challenges, we propose M3-AGIQA, a comprehensive framework for AGI quality assessment that is Multimodal, Multi-Round, and Multi-Aspect. Our approach leverages the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as joint text and image encoders and distills advanced captioning capabilities from online MLLMs into a local model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. The framework includes a structured multi-round evaluation mechanism, where intermediate image descriptions are generated to provide deeper insights into the quality, correspondence, and authenticity aspects. To align predictions with human perceptual judgments, a predictor constructed by an xLSTM and a regression head is incorporated to process sequential logits and predict Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M3-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively capturing nuanced aspects of AGI quality. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation confirms its strong generalizability.

We introduce Social Genome, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. Social Genome contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). Social Genome is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. Social Genome computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of Social Genome through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, 22 pages</p></details> |

Random forest models were trained on simulated XANES, PDF, and both combined to extract oxidation state, coordination number, and mean nearest-neighbor bond length. XANES-only models generally outperformed PDF-only models, even for structural tasks, although using the metal's differential PDFs (dPDFs) instead of total PDFs narrowed this gap. When combined with PDFs, information from XANES often dominates the prediction. Our results demonstrate that XANES contain rich structural information and highlight the utility of species-specificity. This interpretable, multimodal approach is quick to implement with suitable databases and offers valuable insights into the relative strengths of different modalities, guiding researchers in experiment design and identifying when combining complementary techniques adds meaningful information to a scientific investigation.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been commonly used to automate evidence retrieval and factuality verification at scale, their effectiveness for fact-checking is hindered by the absence of FCQ formulation. To bridge this gap, we seek to answer two research questions: (1) Can LLMs generate relevant FCQs? (2) Can LLM-generated FCQs improve multimodal fact-checking? We therefore introduce a framework LRQ-FACT for using LLMs to generate relevant FCQs to facilitate evidence retrieval and enhance fact-checking by probing information across multiple modalities. Through extensive experiments, we verify if LRQ-FACT can generate relevant FCQs of different types and if LRQ-FACT can consistently outperform baseline methods in multimodal fact-checking. Further analysis illustrates how each component in LRQ-FACT works toward improving the fact-checking performance.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we show how MLLMs may be enhanced to support Visual RAG (V-RAG), a retrieval-augmented generation framework that incorporates both text and visual data from retrieved images. On the MIMIC-CXR chest X-ray report generation and Multicare medical image caption generation datasets, we show that Visual RAG improves the accuracy of entity probing, which asks whether a medical entities is grounded by an image. We show that the improvements extend both to frequent and rare entities, the latter of which may have less positive training data. Downstream, we apply V-RAG with entity probing to correct hallucinations and generate more clinically accurate X-ray reports, obtaining a higher RadGraph-F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>GenAI...</summary><p>GenAI4Health - AAAI '25</p></details> |

Our evaluation results show that even state-of-the-art LMM (like OpenAI-o1) can correct their results through human feedback less than 50%.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple image-text interactions, overlooking complex visual formats like charts that are prevalent in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel task, Chart-based MRAG, to address this limitation. To semi-automatically generate high-quality evaluation samples, we propose CHARt-based document question-answering GEneration (CHARGE), a framework that produces evaluation data through structured keypoint extraction, crossmodal verification, and keypoint-based generation. By combining CHARGE with expert validation, we construct Chart-MRAG Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for chart-based MRAG evaluation, featuring 4,738 question-answering pairs across 8 domains from real-world documents. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations in current approaches: (1) unified multimodal embedding retrieval methods struggles in chart-based scenarios, (2) even with ground-truth retrieval, state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve only 58.19% Correctness and 73.87% Coverage scores, and (3) MLLMs demonstrate consistent text-over-visual modality bias during Chart-based MRAG reasoning.

However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures, 9 tables, website: https://yueyang1996.github.io/cosyn/</p></details> |

Our findings reveal that: 1) Cross-modal representations converge over model layers, except in the initial layers specialized at text and speech processing. 2) Length adaptation is crucial for reducing the cross-modal gap between text and speech, although current approaches' effectiveness is primarily limited to high-resource languages. 3) Speech exhibits larger cross-lingual differences than text. 4) For models not explicitly trained for modality-agnostic representations, the modality gap is more prominent than the language gap.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

Current Japanese LMMs often rely on translated English datasets, restricting their ability to capture Japan-specific cultural knowledge. To address this, we explore the potential of Japanese PDF data as a training resource, an area that remains largely underutilized. We introduce a fully automated pipeline that leverages pretrained models to extract image-text pairs from PDFs through layout analysis, OCR, and vision-language pairing, removing the need for manual annotation. Additionally, we construct instruction data from extracted image-text pairs to enrich the training data. To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 3.9% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs. We plan to make the source code and data publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

In other words, the formulation transforms music recommendation into a natural language understanding task, where the model's ability to predict conversation tokens directly optimizes query-item relevance. Our approach eliminates traditional recommendation-dialogue pipeline complexity, enabling end-to-end learning of query-aware music recommendations.

Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires images, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing interpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These features are based on expert-defined concepts, carefully selected based on their alignment with the image content.

Existing studies primarily focus on improving fusion strategies and modeling modality-to-label dependencies. However, they often overlook the impact of \textbf{aleatoric uncertainty}, which is the inherent noise in the multimodal data and hinders the effectiveness of modality fusion by introducing ambiguity into feature representations. To address this issue and effectively model aleatoric uncertainty, this paper proposes Latent emotional Distribution Decomposition with Uncertainty perception (LDDU) framework from a novel perspective of latent emotional space probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive disentangled distribution mechanism within the emotion space to model the multimodal data, allowing for the extraction of semantic features and uncertainty. Furthermore, we design an uncertainty-aware fusion multimodal method that accounts for the dispersed distribution of uncertainty and integrates distribution information. Experimental results show that LDDU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CMU-MOSEI and M$^3$ED datasets, highlighting the importance of uncertainty modeling in MMER.

Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model.

GIMMICK comprises six tasks built upon three new datasets that span 728 unique cultural events or facets on which we evaluated 20 LVLMs and 11 LLMs, including five proprietary and 26 open-weight models of all sizes. We systematically examine (1) regional cultural biases, (2) the influence of model size, (3) input modalities, and (4) external cues. Our analyses reveal strong biases toward Western cultures across models and tasks and highlight strong correlations between model size and performance, as well as the effectiveness of multimodal input and external geographic cues. We further find that models have more knowledge of tangible than intangible aspects (e.g., food vs. rituals) and that they excel in recognizing broad cultural origins but struggle with a more nuanced understanding.</p></details> |  |

Without proper explanation, end users may not be able to understand the potential meaning of fake news. Therefore, we propose a novel task, Fake News Video Explanation (FNVE), to generate natural language explanations that reveal the falseness of news videos. To this end, we first developed ONVE and VTSE, two new datasets to explain fake news video posts. Then, we propose a Multimodal Relation Graph Transformer (MRGT) model to benchmark ONVE and VTSE. MRGT introduces a multimodal relation graph to comprehensively represent multimodal relations and then introduces a BART-based decoder to explain generations. The experimental results show that the proposed MRGT outperforms the strong baselines. In addition, the human evaluation on the annotated ONVE and VTSE also achieves high scores in terms of adequacy rating.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional single-modality approaches (RGB or Radio Frequency (RF)) face challenges in balancing robustness and accuracy due to lighting variations, motion artifacts, and skin tone bias. In this paper, we propose CardiacMamba, a multimodal RGB-RF fusion framework that leverages the complementary strengths of both modalities. It introduces the Temporal Difference Mamba Module (TDMM) to capture dynamic changes in RF signals using timing differences between frames, enhancing the extraction of local and global features. Additionally, CardiacMamba employs a Bidirectional SSM for cross-modal alignment and a Channel-wise Fast Fourier Transform (CFFT) to effectively capture and refine the frequency domain characteristics of RGB and RF signals, ultimately improving heart rate estimation accuracy and periodicity detection. Extensive experiments on the EquiPleth dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving marked improvements in accuracy and robustness. CardiacMamba significantly mitigates skin tone bias, reducing performance disparities across demographic groups, and maintains resilience under missing-modality scenarios. By addressing critical challenges in fairness, adaptability, and precision, the framework advances rPPG technology toward reliable real-world deployment in healthcare.

Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time. For a given fixed model architecture and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. These advantages are maintained even when compared to state-of-the-art recursive techniques like the "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM. Finally, stochastic RINS not only can enhance performance further but also provides the flexibility to optionally forgo increased inference computation at test time with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data such as lab test results capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative embeddings. These embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

These limitations restrict its applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-driven framework for multimodal human action recognition, utilizing event camera and skeleton data. Our framework is centered on two key innovations: (1) a novel multimodal SNN architecture that employs distinct backbone networks for each modality-an SNN-based Mamba for event camera data and a Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (SGN) for skeleton data-combined with a spiking semantic extraction module to capture deep semantic representations; and (2) a pioneering SNN-based discretized information bottleneck mechanism for modality fusion, which effectively balances the preservation of modality-specific semantics with efficient information compression. To validate our approach, we propose a novel method for constructing a multimodal dataset that integrates event camera and skeleton data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both recognition accuracy and energy efficiency, offering a promising solution for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, in the multimodal (MM) domain, there is still a lack of a strong MM-Verifier. In this paper, we introduce MM-Verifier and MM-Reasoner to enhance multimodal reasoning through longer inference and more robust verification. First, we propose a two-step MM verification data synthesis method, which combines a simulation-based tree search with verification and uses rejection sampling to generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (COT) data. This data is then used to fine-tune the verification model, MM-Verifier. Additionally, we present a more efficient method for synthesizing MMCOT data, bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning. The synthesized data is used to fine-tune MM-Reasoner. Our MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on the MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks. Moreover, MM-Reasoner demonstrates strong effectiveness and scalability, with performance improving as data size increases. Finally, our approach achieves strong performance when combining MM-Reasoner and MM-Verifier, reaching an accuracy of 65.3 on MathVista, surpassing GPT-4o (63.8) with 12 rollouts.</p></details> |  |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

However, current E-TTS approaches often struggle to capture the intricacies of human emotions, primarily relying on oversimplified emotional labels or single-modality input. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Multimodal Prompt-Induced Emotional Text-to-Speech System (UMETTS), a novel framework that leverages emotional cues from multiple modalities to generate highly expressive and emotionally resonant speech. The core of UMETTS consists of two key components: the Emotion Prompt Alignment Module (EP-Align) and the Emotion Embedding-Induced TTS Module (EMI-TTS). (1) EP-Align employs contrastive learning to align emotional features across text, audio, and visual modalities, ensuring a coherent fusion of multimodal information. (2) Subsequently, EMI-TTS integrates the aligned emotional embeddings with state-of-the-art TTS models to synthesize speech that accurately reflects the intended emotions. Extensive evaluations show that UMETTS achieves significant improvements in emotion accuracy and speech naturalness, outperforming traditional E-TTS methods on both objective and subjective metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025, Code available at https://github.com/KTTRCDL/UMETTS</p></details> |

However, similar biases have not been extensively explored in large vision-language models (VLMs). As the scale of multimodal models continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to assess whether images can serve as reliable proxies for culture and how these values are embedded through the integration of both visual and textual data. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of multimodal model at different scales, focusing on their alignment with cultural values. Our findings reveal that, much like LLMs, VLMs exhibit sensitivity to cultural values, but their performance in aligning with these values is highly context-dependent. While VLMs show potential in improving value understanding through the use of images, this alignment varies significantly across contexts highlighting the complexities and underexplored challenges in the alignment of multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

We propose mmMamba, a framework for developing linear-complexity native multimodal state space models through progressive distillation from existing MLLMs using moderate academic computational resources. Our approach enables the direct conversion of trained decoder-only MLLMs to linear-complexity architectures without requiring pre-trained RNN-based LLM or vision encoders. We propose an seeding strategy to carve Mamba from trained Transformer and a three-stage distillation recipe, which can effectively transfer the knowledge from Transformer to Mamba while preserving multimodal capabilities. Our method also supports flexible hybrid architectures that combine Transformer and Mamba layers for customizable efficiency-performance trade-offs. Distilled from the Transformer-based decoder-only HoVLE, mmMamba-linear achieves competitive performance against existing linear and quadratic-complexity VLMs, while mmMamba-hybrid further improves performance significantly, approaching HoVLE's capabilities. At 103K tokens, mmMamba-linear demonstrates 20.6$\times$ speedup and 75.8% GPU memory reduction compared to HoVLE, while mmMamba-hybrid achieves 13.5$\times$ speedup and 60.2% memory savings.

Magma is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets.

These biases arise from the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, affecting the attention mechanism responsible for aligning multimodal inputs. Existing decoding-based mitigation methods focus on statistical correlations and overlook the causal relationships between attention mechanisms and model output, limiting their effectiveness in addressing these biases. To tackle this issue, we propose a causal inference framework termed CausalMM that applies structural causal modeling to MLLMs, treating modality priors as a confounder between attention mechanisms and output. Specifically, by employing backdoor adjustment and counterfactual reasoning at both the visual and language attention levels, our method mitigates the negative effects of modality priors and enhances the alignment of MLLM's inputs and outputs, with a maximum score improvement of 65.3% on 6 VLind-Bench indicators and 164 points on MME Benchmark compared to conventional methods.

Here, we introduce a nonlinear, multimodal prediction model that combines audio and linguistic features from pre-trained models (e.g., LLAMA, Whisper). Our approach achieves a 17.2% and 17.9% improvement in prediction performance (unnormalized and normalized correlation) over traditional unimodal linear models, as well as a 7.7% and 14.4% improvement, respectively, over prior state-of-the-art models. These improvements represent a major step towards future robust in-silico testing and improved decoding performance. They also reveal how auditory and semantic information are fused in motor, somatosensory, and higher-level semantic regions, aligning with existing neurolinguistic theories. Overall, our work highlights the often neglected potential of nonlinear and multimodal approaches to brain modeling, paving the way for future studies to embrace these strategies in naturalistic neurolinguistics research.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advancements in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and Contrastive Learning (CL) methodologies, this research aims to develop CL methodologies to translate implicit knowledge in VFM into change representations, thus eliminating the need for explicit supervision. To this end, we introduce a Semantic-to-Change (S2C) learning framework for UCD in both homogeneous and multimodal RS images. Differently from existing CL methodologies that typically focus on learning multi-temporal similarities, we introduce a novel triplet learning strategy that explicitly models temporal differences, which are crucial to the CD task. Furthermore, random spatial and spectral perturbations are introduced during the training to enhance robustness to temporal noise. In addition, a grid sparsity regularization is defined to suppress insignificant changes, and an IoU-matching algorithm is developed to refine the CD results. Experiments on four benchmark CD datasets demonstrate that the proposed S2C learning framework achieves significant improvements in accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art by over 31\%, 9\%, 23\%, and 15\%, respectively. It also demonstrates robustness and sample efficiency, suitable for training and adaptation of various Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) or backbone neural networks.

Hence, there is an urgent need to develop effective methods to detect machine-generated content. However, the lack of aligned multimodal datasets inhibited the development of such methods, particularly in triple-modality settings (e.g., text, image, and voice). In this paper, we introduce RU-AI, a new large-scale multimodal dataset for robust and effective detection of machine-generated content in text, image and voice. Our dataset is constructed on the basis of three large publicly available datasets: Flickr8K, COCO and Places205, by adding their corresponding AI duplicates, resulting in a total of 1,475,370 instances. In addition, we created an additional noise variant of the dataset for testing the robustness of detection models. We conducted extensive experiments with the current SOTA detection methods on our dataset. The results reveal that existing models still struggle to achieve accurate and robust detection on our dataset. We hope that this new data set can promote research in the field of machine-generated content detection, fostering the responsible use of generative AI.

Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.</p></details> |  |

Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |

However, a substantial volume of non-paired data, such as multimodal interleaved documents, remains underutilized for vision-language representation learning. To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts. Based on these innovations, we construct RealSyn, a dataset combining realistic and synthetic texts, available in three scales: 15M, 30M, and 100M. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealSyn effectively advances vision-language representation learning and exhibits strong scalability. Models pre-trained on RealSyn achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

However, they require excessive training data. We propose canonical similarity analysis (CSA), which uses two unimodal encoders to replicate multimodal encoders using limited data. CSA maps unimodal features into a multimodal space, using a new similarity score to retain only the multimodal information. CSA only involves the inference of unimodal encoders and a cubic-complexity matrix decomposition, eliminating the need for extensive GPU-based model training. Experiments show that CSA outperforms CLIP while requiring $50,000\times$ fewer multimodal data pairs to bridge the modalities given pre-trained unimodal encoders on ImageNet classification and misinformative news caption detection. CSA surpasses the state-of-the-art method to map unimodal features to multimodal features. We also demonstrate the ability of CSA with modalities beyond image and text, paving the way for future modality pairs with limited paired multimodal data but abundant unpaired unimodal data, such as lidar and text.</p></details> |  |

As the size of pre-trained language models continues to grow, training larger multimodal sentiment analysis models using previous approaches could result in unnecessary computational cost. In response to this challenge, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{S}entiment Analysis and \textbf{E}motion Recognition \textbf{Adapter} (MSE-Adapter), a lightweight and adaptable plugin. This plugin enables a large language model (LLM) to carry out MSA or ERC tasks with minimal computational overhead (only introduces approximately 2.6M to 2.8M trainable parameters upon the 6/7B models), while preserving the intrinsic capabilities of the LLM. In the MSE-Adapter, the Text-Guide-Mixer (TGM) module is introduced to establish explicit connections between non-textual and textual modalities through the Hadamard product. This allows non-textual modalities to better align with textual modalities at the feature level, promoting the generation of higher-quality pseudo tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public English and Chinese datasets using consumer-grade GPUs and open-source LLMs (Qwen-1.8B, ChatGLM3-6B-base, and LLaMA2-7B) as the backbone. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plugin. The code will be released on GitHub after a blind review.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce Migician, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the MGrounding-630k dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose MIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 24.94% and even surpassing much larger 70B models.

We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |

As LMMs grow increasingly influential, addressing and mitigating inherent biases related to stereotypes, harmful generations, and ambiguous assumptions in real-world scenarios has become essential. However, existing datasets evaluating stereotype biases in LMMs often lack diversity and rely on synthetic images, leaving a gap in bias evaluation for real-world visual contexts. To address this, we introduce the Stereotype Bias Benchmark (SB-bench), the most comprehensive framework to date for assessing stereotype biases across nine diverse categories with non-synthetic images. SB-bench rigorously evaluates LMMs through carefully curated, visually grounded scenarios, challenging them to reason accurately about visual stereotypes. It offers a robust evaluation framework featuring real-world visual samples, image variations, and multiple-choice question formats. By introducing visually grounded queries that isolate visual biases from textual ones, SB-bench enables a precise and nuanced assessment of a model's reasoning capabilities across varying levels of difficulty. Through rigorous testing of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source LMMs, SB-bench provides a systematic approach to assessing stereotype biases in LMMs across key social dimensions. This benchmark represents a significant step toward fostering fairness in AI systems and reducing harmful biases, laying the groundwork for more equitable and socially responsible LMMs. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Building on this insight, we propose HermesFlow, a simple yet general framework designed to seamlessly bridge the gap between understanding and generation in MLLMs. Specifically, we take the homologous data as input to curate homologous preference data of both understanding and generation. Through Pair-DPO and self-play iterative optimization, HermesFlow effectively aligns multimodal understanding and generation using homologous preference data.

However, the rapid expansion of visual instruction datasets introduces significant data redundancy, leading to excessive computational costs. Existing data selection methods predominantly rely on proxy models or loss-based metrics, both of which impose substantial computational overheads due to the necessity of model inference and backpropagation. To address this challenge, we propose PRISM, a novel training-free approach for efficient multimodal data selection. Unlike existing methods, PRISM eliminates the reliance on proxy models, warm-up pretraining, and gradient-based optimization. Instead, it leverages Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the intrinsic visual encoding properties of MLLMs, computing a task-specific correlation score to identify high-value instances. This not only enbles data-efficient selection,but maintains the original performance. Empirical evaluations across multiple MLLMs demonstrate that PRISM reduces the overall time required for visual instruction tuning and data selection to just 30% of conventional methods, while surpassing fully fine-tuned models across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, achieving a 101.7% relative improvement in final performance.</p></details> |  |

MLLMs have extended the success of large language models to modalities (e.g. images) beyond text, but their billion scale hinders deployment on resource-constrained end devices. While cloud-hosted MLLMs could be available, transmitting raw, uncompressed images captured by end devices to the cloud requires an efficient image compression system. To address this, we focus on emerging neural image compression and propose a novel framework with a lightweight transform-neck and a surrogate loss to adapt compressed image latents for MLLM-based vision tasks. Given the huge scale of MLLMs, our framework excludes the entire downstream MLLM except part of its visual encoder from training our system. This stands out from most existing coding for machine approaches that involve downstream networks in training and thus could be impractical when the networks are MLLMs. The proposed framework is general in that it is applicable to various MLLMs, neural image codecs, and multiple application scenarios, where the neural image codec can be (1) pre-trained for human perception without updating, (2) fully updated for joint human and machine perception, or (3) fully updated for only machine perception.

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images.

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2111.05194v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
