| **[TMLC-Net: Transferable Meta Label Correction for Noisy Label Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07721v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07721v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of noisy labels in real-world datasets poses a significant impediment to the effective deployment of deep learning models. While meta-learning strategies have emerged as a promising approach for addressing this challenge, existing methods often suffer from limited transferability and task-specific designs. This paper introduces TMLC-Net, a novel Transferable Meta-Learner for Correcting Noisy Labels, designed to overcome these limitations. TMLC-Net learns a general-purpose label correction strategy that can be readily applied across diverse datasets and model architectures without requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Our approach integrates three core components: (1) Normalized Noise Perception, which captures and normalizes training dynamics to handle distribution shifts; (2) Time-Series Encoding, which models the temporal evolution of sample statistics using a recurrent neural network; and (3) Subclass Decoding, which predicts a corrected label distribution based on the learned representations. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with various noise types and levels, demonstrating that TMLC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness to label noise. Furthermore, we analyze the transferability of TMLC-Net, showcasing its adaptability to new datasets and noise conditions, and establishing its potential as a broadly applicable solution for robust deep learning in noisy environments.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel, scalable framework for future research in the field.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Health Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07608v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07608v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CHIL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07542v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07542v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138v4)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.01138v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting the future development in quality and value of professional football players for applications in team management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07528v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07528v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. Using a historical data set of data-driven indicators describing player quality and the transfer value of a football player, the models are trained to forecast player quality and player value one year ahead. These two prediction problems demonstrate the efficacy of tree-based models, particularly random forest and XGBoost, in making accurate predictions. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, our research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. Our research provides models to help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article itself is on the pages 1-27.

We develop an analytic framework for this scenario based on a reduction to online learning with delayed feedback. In particular, we show that the existence of an online learning algorithm with bounded regret (against a fixed statistical learning algorithm in a specially constructed game of online learning with delayed feedback) implies low generalization error of said statistical learning method even if the data sequence is sampled from a mixing time series. The rates demonstrate a trade-off between the amount of delay in the online learning game and the degree of dependence between consecutive data points, with near-optimal rates recovered in a number of well-studied settings when the delay is tuned appropriately as a function of the mixing time of the process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Patterns Behind Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07491v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07491v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive framework for time series prediction using a hybrid model that combines ARIMA and LSTM. The model incorporates feature engineering techniques, including embedding and PCA, to transform raw data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining key information. The embedding technique is used to convert categorical data into continuous vectors, facilitating the capture of complex relationships. PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality and extract principal components, enhancing model performance and computational efficiency. To handle both linear and nonlinear patterns in the data, the ARIMA model captures linear trends, while the LSTM model models complex nonlinear dependencies. The hybrid model is trained on historical data and achieves high accuracy, as demonstrated by low RMSE and MAE scores. Additionally, the paper employs the run test to assess the randomness of sequences, providing insights into the underlying patterns. Ablation studies are conducted to validate the roles of different components in the model, demonstrating the significance of each module. The paper also utilizes the SHAP method to quantify the impact of traditional advantages on the predicted results, offering a detailed understanding of feature importance. The KNN method is used to determine the optimal prediction interval, further enhancing the model's accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning techniques for robust time series forecasting in Sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physiome-ODE: A Benchmark for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Based on Biological ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07489v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07489v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for forecasting irregularly sampled time series with missing values predominantly rely on just four datasets and a few small toy examples for evaluation. While ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the prevalent models in science and engineering, a baseline model that forecasts a constant value outperforms ODE-based models from the last five years on three of these existing datasets. This unintuitive finding hampers further research on ODE-based models, a more plausible model family. In this paper, we develop a methodology to generate irregularly sampled multivariate time series (IMTS) datasets from ordinary differential equations and to select challenging instances via rejection sampling. Using this methodology, we create Physiome-ODE, a large and sophisticated benchmark of IMTS datasets consisting of 50 individual datasets, derived from real-world ordinary differential equations from research in biology. Physiome-ODE is the first benchmark for IMTS forecasting that we are aware of and an order of magnitude larger than the current evaluation setting of four datasets. Using our benchmark Physiome-ODE, we show qualitatively completely different results than those derived from the current four datasets: on Physiome-ODE ODE-based models can play to their strength and our benchmark can differentiate in a meaningful way between different IMTS forecasting models. This way, we expect to give a new impulse to research on ODE-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSformer: Parameter-efficient Transformer with Segment Attention for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01419v2)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.01419v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across various domains, often complicated by high-dimensional data and long-term dependencies. This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for time series forecasting, incorporating two key innovations: parameter sharing (PS) and Spatial-Temporal Segment Attention (SegAtt). We also define the time series segment as the concatenation of sequence patches from the same positions across different variables. The proposed model, PSformer, reduces the number of training parameters through the parameter sharing mechanism, thereby improving model efficiency and scalability. The introduction of SegAtt could enhance the capability of capturing local spatio-temporal dependencies by computing attention over the segments, and improve global representation by integrating information across segments. The combination of parameter sharing and SegAtt significantly improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSformer outperforms popular baselines and other transformer-based approaches in terms of accuracy and scalability, establishing itself as an accurate and scalable tool for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[xPatch: Dual-Stream Time Series Forecasting with Exponential Seasonal-Trend Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17323v3)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.17323v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the application of transformer-based models in time-series forecasting has received significant attention. While often demonstrating promising results, the transformer architecture encounters challenges in fully exploiting the temporal relations within time series data due to its attention mechanism. In this work, we design eXponential Patch (xPatch for short), a novel dual-stream architecture that utilizes exponential decomposition. Inspired by the classical exponential smoothing approaches, xPatch introduces the innovative seasonal-trend exponential decomposition module. Additionally, we propose a dual-flow architecture that consists of an MLP-based linear stream and a CNN-based non-linear stream. This model investigates the benefits of employing patching and channel-independence techniques within a non-transformer model. Finally, we develop a robust arctangent loss function and a sigmoid learning rate adjustment scheme, which prevent overfitting and boost forecasting performance. The code is available at the following repository: https://github.com/stitsyuk/xPatch.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework for streamflow and flood prediction in Australian catchments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15882v2)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.15882v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting extreme climate events; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge due to factors such as model calibration and missing data. We present an ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework that addresses large-scale streamflow forecasts using quantile regression for uncertainty projections in prediction. We evaluate selected univariate and multivariate deep learning models and catchment strategies. Furthermore, we implement a multistep time-series prediction model using the CAMELS dataset for selected catchments across Australia. The ensemble model employs a set of quantile deep learning models for streamflow determined by historical streamflow data. We utilise the streamflow prediction and obtain flood probability using flood frequency analysis and compare it with historical flooding events for selected catchments. Our results demonstrate notable efficacy and uncertainties in streamflow forecasts with varied catchment properties. Our flood probability estimates show good accuracy in capturing the historical floods from the selected catchments. This underscores the potential for our deep learning framework to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions and be implemented as an early warning system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Transformers as VAR Models: Aligning Autoregressive Attention Mechanisms with Autoregressive Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07244v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07244v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive attention-based time series forecasting (TSF) has drawn increasing interest, with mechanisms like linear attention sometimes outperforming vanilla attention. However, deeper Transformer architectures frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow, multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model. Then, we propose Structural Aligned Mixture of VAR (SAMoVAR), a linear Transformer variant that integrates interpretable dynamic VAR weights for multivariate TSF. By aligning the Transformer architecture with autoregressive objectives, SAMoVAR delivers improved performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency, comparing to SOTA TSF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are KANs Effective for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11306v2)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.11306v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future states based on historical inputs. Related techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Despite their significant advancements, existing methods continue to struggle with the challenge of inadequate interpretability. The rise of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) provides a new perspective to solve this challenge, but current work has not yet concluded whether KAN is effective in time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of KANs in time-series forecasting from the perspectives of performance, integrability, efficiency, and interpretability. To this end, we propose the Multi-layer Mixture-of-KAN network (MMK), which achieves excellent performance while retaining KAN's ability to be transformed into a combination of symbolic functions. The core module of MMK is the mixture-of-KAN layer, which uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to best-matched KAN experts. Then, we explore some useful experimental strategies to deal with the issues in the training stage. Finally, we compare MMK and various baselines on seven datasets. Extensive experimental and visualization results demonstrate that KANs are effective in multivariate time series forecasting.

| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v3)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.04442v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/Hank0626/TimeBridge.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 11 Figures, 22 Tables.

| **[Joint parameter and state estimation for regularized time-discrete multibody dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06599v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06599v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a method for offline parameter estimation of discrete multibody dynamics with regularized and frictional kinematic constraints. This setting leads to unobserved degrees of freedom, which we handle using joint state and parameter estimation. Our method finds the states and parameters as the solution to a nonlinear least squares optimization problem based on the inverse dynamics and the observation error. The solution is found using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with derivatives from automatic differentiation and custom differentiation rules for the complementary conditions that appear due to dry frictional constraints. We reduce the number of method parameters to the choice of the time-step, regularization coefficients, and a parameter that controls the relative weighting of inverse dynamics and observation errors. We evaluate the method using synthetic and real measured data, focusing on performance and sensitivity to method parameters. In particular, we optimize over a 13-dimensional parameter space, including inertial, frictional, tilt, and motor parameters, using data from a real Furuta pendulum. Results show fast convergence, in the order of seconds, and good agreement for different time-series of recorded data over multiple method parameter choices. However, very stiff constraints may cause difficulties in solving the optimization problem. We conclude that our method can be very fast and has method parameters that are robust and easy to set in the tested scenarios.</p></details> | 49 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets for Time-series Joint Alignment and Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06591v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06591v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment remains a pivotal challenge that forestalls even simple averaging. Since its introduction, the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), which we first introduced (Weber et al., 2019) and further developed in (Weber & Freifeld, 2023), has proven itself as an effective solution for this problem (these conference papers are earlier partial versions of the current manuscript). DTAN predicts and applies diffeomorphic transformations in an input-dependent manner, thus facilitating the joint alignment (JA) and averaging of time-series ensembles in an unsupervised or a weakly-supervised manner. The inherent challenges of the weakly/unsupervised setting, particularly the risk of trivial solutions through excessive signal distortion, are mitigated using either one of two distinct strategies: 1) a regularization term for warps; 2) using the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE). The latter is a novel, regularization-free approach which also facilitates the JA of variable-length signals. We also further extend our framework to incorporate multi-task learning (MT-DTAN), enabling simultaneous time-series alignment and classification. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different backbone architectures, demonstrating their efficacy in time-series alignment tasks. Finally, we showcase the utility of our approach in enabling Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for misaligned time-series data. Extensive experiments across 128 UCR datasets validate the superiority of our approach over contemporary averaging methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, marking a significant advancement in the field of time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript covers and extends the papers: Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (DTAN; NeruIPS 2019) and Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (ICML 2023).

Numerous ECTS approaches have been proposed, based on different triggering functions, each taking into account various pieces of information related to the incoming time series and/or the output of a classifier. Although their performances have been empirically compared in the literature, no studies have been carried out on the optimality of these triggering functions that involve ``man-tailored'' decision rules. Based on the same information, could there be better triggering functions? This paper presents one way to investigate this question by showing first how to translate ECTS problems into Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, where the very same information is used in the state space. A thorough comparison of the performance obtained by ``handmade'' approaches and their ``RL-based'' counterparts has been carried out. A second question investigated in this paper is whether a different combination of information, defining the state space in RL systems, can achieve even better performance. Experiments show that the system we describe, called \textsc{Alert}, significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors on a large number of datasets.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Time Series Forecasting: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Guided by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v2)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.06282v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data. To address this, we present a pilot study on using reinforcement learning (RL) for time series data augmentation. Our method, ReAugment, tackles three critical questions: which parts of the training set should be augmented, how the augmentation should be performed, and what advantages RL brings to the process. Specifically, our approach maintains a forecasting model zoo, and by measuring prediction diversity across the models, we identify samples with higher probabilities for overfitting and use them as the anchor points for augmentation. Leveraging RL, our method adaptively transforms the overfit-prone samples into new data that not only enhances training set diversity but also directs the augmented data to target regions where the forecasting models are prone to overfitting. We validate the effectiveness of ReAugment across a wide range of base models, showing its advantages in both standard time series forecasting and few-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |

We introduce Powerformer, a novel Transformer variant that replaces noncausal attention weights with causal weights that are reweighted according to a smooth heavy-tailed decay. This simple yet effective modification endows the model with an inductive bias favoring temporally local dependencies, while still allowing sufficient flexibility to learn the unique correlation structure of each dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate that Powerformer not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public time-series benchmarks, but also that it offers improved interpretability of attention patterns. Our analyses show that the model's locality bias is amplified during training, demonstrating an interplay between time-series data and power-law-based attention. These findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modifications to the Transformer architecture for time-series forecasting, and they establish Powerformer as a strong, efficient, and principled baseline for future research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Decomposing the mixed frequency components into multiple single frequency components is a natural choice. However, the information density of patterns varies across different frequencies, and employing a uniform modeling approach for different frequency components can lead to inaccurate characterization. To address this challenges, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose a KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning architecture (TimeKAN) to address the complex forecasting challenges caused by multiple frequency mixtures. Specifically, TimeKAN mainly consists of three components: Cascaded Frequency Decomposition (CFD) blocks, Multi-order KAN Representation Learning (M-KAN) blocks and Frequency Mixing blocks. CFD blocks adopt a bottom-up cascading approach to obtain series representations for each frequency band. Benefiting from the high flexibility of KAN, we design a novel M-KAN block to learn and represent specific temporal patterns within each frequency band. Finally, Frequency Mixing blocks is used to recombine the frequency bands into the original format. Extensive experimental results across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TimeKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance as an extremely lightweight architecture.

We also design three self-supervised learning strategies to facilitate the fusion of sequence and image representations, capturing a more generalizable joint representation. The results indicate that our approach outperforms seven other state-of-the-art models in three representative real-world clinical datasets. We further validate our approach by simulating two major types of real-world missingness through leave-sensors-out and leave-samples-out techniques.

Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose TimeDART, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Consequently, the regression model could neglect the data's interrelationships, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance. Moreover, the existence of aleatoric uncertainty in the training data may drive the model to capture non-generalizable patterns, contributing to increased overfitting. To address these issues, we propose a novel adaptive pairwise learning framework for regression tasks (AdaPRL) which leverages the relative differences between data points and integrates with deep probabilistic models to quantify the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Additionally, we adapt AdaPRL for applications in multi-task learning and multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments with several real-world regression datasets including recommendation systems, age prediction, time series forecasting, natural language understanding, finance, and industry datasets show that AdaPRL is compatible with different backbone networks in various tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the vast majority of tasks without extra inference cost, highlighting its notable potential including enhancing prediction accuracy and ranking ability, increasing generalization capability, improving robustness to noisy data, improving resilience to reduced data, and enhancing interpretability. Experiments also show that AdaPRL can be seamlessly incorporated into recently proposed regression frameworks to gain performance improvement.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |

However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, when the time series data suffer from potential structural breaks or concept drifts, the forecasting performance might be significantly reduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) for optimal forecasting, which can be combined with existing time series forecasting models. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine the optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and then enhance the prediction performances of the base forecasting models. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive empirical analysis have been conducted on the M4 dataset and other real world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete time series dataset. Moreover, comparison results reveals that combining our approach with existing forecasting models can achieve better prediction accuracy, which also reflect the advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important.

We propose a novel conformal prediction method to address these two key challenges by integrating Transformer and Normalizing Flow. Specifically, the Transformer encodes the historical context of time series, and normalizing flow learns the transformation from the base distribution to the distribution of non-conformity scores conditioned on the encoded historical context. This enables the construction of prediction regions by transforming samples from the base distribution using the learned conditional flow. We ensure the marginal coverage by defining the prediction regions as sets in the transformed space that correspond to a predefined probability mass in the base distribution. The model is trained end-to-end by Flow Matching, avoiding the need for computationally intensive numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves smaller prediction regions compared to the baselines while satisfying the desired coverage through comprehensive experiments using simulated and real-world time series datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel normalization technique that considers the inherent nature of tokenization. The proposed Tokenization-Optimized Normalization (TOKON) simplifies time series data by representing each element with a single token, effectively reducing the number of tokens by 2 to 3 times. Additionally, we introduce a novel prompt for time series forecasting, termed Time Series Forecasting with Care (TFSC), to further enhance forecasting performance. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKON improves root mean square error (RMSE) for multi-step forecasting by approximately 7% to 18%, depending on the dataset and prompting method. Furthermore, TFSC, when used in conjunction with TOKON, shows additional improvements in forecasting accuracy for certain datasets</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the characteristics of LLMs for time series forecasting by considering various existing and proposed prompting techniques. Forecasting for both short and long time series was evaluated. Our findings indicate that no single prompting method is universally applicable. It was also observed that simply providing proper context information related to the time series, without additional reasoning prompts, can achieve performance comparable to the best-performing prompt for each case. From this observation, it is expected that providing proper context information can be more crucial than a prompt for specific reasoning in time series forecasting. Several weaknesses in prompting for time series forecasting were also identified. First, LLMs often fail to follow the procedures described by the prompt. Second, when reasoning steps involve simple algebraic calculations with several operands, LLMs often fail to calculate accurately. Third, LLMs sometimes misunderstand the semantics of prompts, resulting in incomplete responses.</p></details> |  |

In federated learning, local model training by multiple clients and model integration by a server are repeated only through model parameter sharing. Most existing federated learning methods assume training deep learning models, which are often computationally demanding. To deal with this issue, we propose federated learning methods with reservoir state analysis to seek computational efficiency and data privacy protection simultaneously. Specifically, our method relies on Mahalanobis Distance of Reservoir States (MD-RS) method targeting time series anomaly detection, which learns a distribution of reservoir states for normal inputs and detects anomalies based on a deviation from the learned distribution. Iterative updating of statistical parameters in the MD-RS enables incremental federated learning (IncFed MD-RS). We evaluate the performance of IncFed MD-RS using benchmark datasets for time series anomaly detection. The results show that IncFed MD-RS outperforms other federated learning methods with deep learning and reservoir computing models particularly when clients' data are relatively short and heterogeneous. We demonstrate that IncFed MD-RS is robust against reduced sample data compared to other methods. We also show that the computational cost of IncFed MD-RS can be reduced by subsampling from the reservoir states without performance degradation. The proposed method is beneficial especially in anomaly detection applications where computational efficiency, algorithm simplicity, and low communication cost are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 16 figures, submitted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

While automatic augmentation has demonstrated success in image classification tasks, its application to time-series problems, particularly in long-term forecasting, has received comparatively less attention. To address this gap, we introduce a time-series automatic augmentation approach named TSAA, which is both efficient and easy to implement. The solution involves tackling the associated bilevel optimization problem through a two-step process: initially training a non-augmented model for a limited number of epochs, followed by an iterative split procedure. During this iterative process, we alternate between identifying a robust augmentation policy through Bayesian optimization and refining the model while discarding suboptimal runs. Extensive evaluations on challenging univariate and multivariate forecasting benchmark problems demonstrate that TSAA consistently outperforms several robust baselines, suggesting its potential integration into prediction pipelines.

To resolve this, we propose FlowTS, an ODE-based model that leverages rectified flow with straight-line transport in probability space. By learning geodesic paths between distributions, FlowTS achieves computational efficiency through exact linear trajectory simulation, accelerating training and generation while improving performances. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy inspired by the exploration-exploitation trade-off, balancing noise adaptation and precision. Notably, FlowTS enables seamless adaptation from unconditional to conditional generation without retraining, ensuring efficient real-world deployment. Also, to enhance generation authenticity, FlowTS integrates trend and seasonality decomposition, attention registers (for global context aggregation), and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (for position information). For unconditional setting, extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, with context FID scores of 0.019 and 0.011 on Stock and ETTh datasets (prev. best: 0.067, 0.061). For conditional setting, we have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting (MSE 213, prev. best: 375) and MuJoCo imputation tasks (MSE 7e-5, prev. best 2.7e-4).

Classic conformal prediction relies on a single notion of conformity, overlooking the multi-level structures that arise in applications such as image analysis, hierarchical data exploration, and multi-resolution time series modeling. In contrast, the proposed framework defines a distinct conformity function at each relevant scale or resolution, producing multiple conformal predictors whose prediction sets are then intersected to form the final multi-scale output. We establish theoretical results confirming that the multi-scale prediction set retains the marginal coverage guarantees of the original conformal framework and can, in fact, yield smaller or more precise sets in practice. By distributing the total miscoverage probability across scales in proportion to their informative power, the method further refines the set sizes. We also show that dependence between scales can lead to conservative coverage, ensuring that the actual coverage exceeds the nominal level. Numerical experiments in a synthetic classification setting demonstrate that multi-scale conformal prediction achieves or surpasses the nominal coverage level while generating smaller prediction sets compared to single-scale conformal methods.</p></details> |  |

Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have been long known for being problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. A TSF foundation model serving TSF tasks across different applications can reverse such an impression. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers a pioneering study in developing a TSF foundation model and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. In ViTime, a method synthesizing authentic time series periodic and trend patterns is developed to enrich sample pattern diversity. A deep architecture operating TSF in image metric space is designed to achieve significantly enhanced TSF generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's SOTA performance across multiple settings. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15%. With just 10% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks trained on complete datasets, with this performance gap widening further at 100\% fine-tuning. Additionally, ViTime exhibits exceptional robustness, handling missing data without imputation and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30% under various data perturbations.</p></details> |  |

Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR.

Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12th ...</summary><p>12th IEEE Conference on Technologies for Sustainability</p></details> |

Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting is crucial for effective market participation, where price dynamics can be significantly more challenging to predict. Probabilistic forecasting, through prediction intervals, efficiently quantifies the inherent uncertainties in electricity prices, supporting better decision-making for market participants. This study explores the enhancement of probabilistic price prediction using Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, specifically Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals and Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference. These methods provide precise and reliable prediction intervals, outperforming traditional models in validity metrics. We propose an ensemble approach that combines the efficiency of quantile regression models with the robust coverage properties of time series adapted CP techniques. This ensemble delivers both narrow prediction intervals and high coverage, leading to more reliable and accurate forecasts. We further evaluate the practical implications of CP techniques through a simulated trading algorithm applied to a battery storage system. The ensemble approach demonstrates improved financial returns in energy trading in both the Day-Ahead and Balancing Markets, highlighting its practical benefits for market participants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v3)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.08435v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

The model first uses CNN to extract local patterns of multidimensional features of financial markets, and then models the bidirectional dependency of time series through BiLSTM, to comprehensively characterize the changing laws of systemic risk in spatial features and temporal dynamics. The experiment is based on real financial data sets. The results show that the model is significantly superior to traditional single models (such as BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer, and TCN) in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The F1-score reaches 0.88, showing extremely high discriminant ability. This shows that the joint strategy of combining CNN and BiLSTM can not only fully capture the complex patterns of market data but also effectively deal with the long-term dependency problem in time series data. In addition, this study also explores the robustness of the model in dealing with data noise and processing high-dimensional data, providing strong support for intelligent financial risk management. In the future, the research will further optimize the model structure, introduce methods such as reinforcement learning and multimodal data analysis, and improve the efficiency and generalization ability of the model to cope with a more complex financial environment.</p></details> |  |

It can adapt to various attention mechanisms, enhancing and decoupling their ability to capture long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data. In this paper, we first demonstrate that, for the time series forecasting (TSF) task, the previously overlooked decoder-only autoregressive Transformer model can achieve results comparable to the best baselines when appropriate tokenization and training methods are applied. Moreover, inspired by the ARMA model from statistics and recent advances in linear attention, we introduce the full ARMA structure into existing autoregressive attention mechanisms. By using an indirect MA weight generation method, we incorporate the MA term while maintaining the time complexity and parameter size of the underlying efficient attention models. We further explore how indirect parameter generation can produce implicit MA weights that align with the modeling requirements for local temporal impacts. Experimental results show that WAVE attention that incorporates the ARMA structure consistently improves the performance of various AR attentions on TSF tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[The $α$-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593v1)** | 2025-02-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04593v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codebase will be made available upon publication.

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> |  |

Accurate classification for medical time series, e.g., Electrocardiography (ECG) signals, can help for early detection and diagnosis. Traditional methods towards medical time series classification rely on handcrafted feature extraction and statistical methods; with the recent advancement of artificial intelligence, the machine learning and deep learning methods have become more popular. However, existing methods often fail to fully model the complex spatial dynamics under different scales, which ignore the dynamic multi-resolution spatial and temporal joint inter-dependencies. Moreover, they are less likely to consider the special baseline wander problem as well as the multi-view characteristics of medical time series, which largely hinders their prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Graph Learning framework, MedGNN, for medical time series classification. Specifically, we first propose to construct multi-resolution adaptive graph structures to learn dynamic multi-scale embeddings. Then, to address the baseline wander problem, we propose Difference Attention Networks to operate self-attention mechanisms on the finite difference for temporal modeling. Moreover, to learn the multi-view characteristics, we utilize the Frequency Convolution Networks to capture complementary information of medical time series from the frequency domain. In addition, we introduce the Multi-resolution Graph Transformer architecture to model the dynamic dependencies and fuse the information from different resolutions. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on multiple medical real-world datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

Existing solutions either rely on using certain statistics to specify the shift, or developing specific mechanisms for certain network architectures. However, the former would fail for the unknown shift beyond simple statistics, while the latter has limited compatibility on different forecasting models. To overcome these problems, we first propose a decoupled formulation for time series forecasting, with no reliance on fixed statistics and no restriction on forecasting architectures. This formulation regards the removing-shift procedure as a special transformation between a raw distribution and a desired target distribution and separates it from the forecasting. Such a formulation is further formalized into a bi-level optimization problem, to enable the joint learning of the transformation (outer loop) and forecasting (inner loop). Moreover, the special requirements of expressiveness and bi-direction for the transformation motivate us to propose instance normalization flow (IN-Flow), a novel invertible network for time series transformation. Different from the classic "normalizing flow" models, IN-Flow does not aim for normalizing input to the prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian distribution) for generation, but creatively transforms time series distribution by stacking normalization layers and flow-based invertible networks, which is thus named "normalization" flow. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data, which demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Many reconstruction algorithms have been proposed, although less research has been devoted to describe their theoretical limitations. In this work, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and define the reconstructability: The fraction of structural information recoverable from data. The reconstructability depends on the true data generating (TDG) model which is shown to set the reconstruction limit: any algorithm can perform, on average, at best like the TDG model. We show that the reconstructability is related to various performance measures, such as the probability of error and the Jaccard similarity. In an empirical context where the TDG model is unknown, we introduce the reconstruction index as an approximation of the reconstructability. We find that performing model selection is crucial for the validity of the reconstruction index as a proxy of the reconstructability of empirical time series and networks.</p></details> |  |

While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

A Gaussian kernel-based mean square error preserves local data structure, while K-means initializes shapelet candidates due to the non-convex optimization challenge. Unlike existing methods, our approach uses t-SNE to address crowding in low-dimensional space and applies L1-norm regularization to optimize shapelet length. Evaluations on the UCR dataset and an electrical component manipulation task, like switching on, demonstrate improved clustering accuracy over state-of-the-art feature-learning methods in robotics.</p></details> |  |

We apply these measures to the NetMob 2024 Data Challenge data, and obtain interesting results that are consistent with published statistics and commuting patterns in cities. Besides building a new framework, we foresee applications of this approach to an improved understanding of human mobility in the context of environmental changes and sustainable development.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[On the importance of structural identifiability for machine learning with partially observed dynamical systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04131v1)** | 2025-02-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.04131v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The successful application of modern machine learning for time series classification is often hampered by limitations in quality and quantity of available training data. To overcome these limitations, available domain expert knowledge in the form of parametrised mechanistic dynamical models can be used whenever it is available and time series observations may be represented as an element from a given class of parametrised dynamical models. This makes the learning process interpretable and allows the modeller to deal with sparsely and irregularly sampled data in a natural way. However, the internal processes of a dynamical model are often only partially observed. This can lead to ambiguity regarding which particular model realization best explains a given time series observation. This problem is well-known in the literature, and a dynamical model with this issue is referred to as structurally unidentifiable. Training a classifier that incorporates knowledge about a structurally unidentifiable dynamical model can negatively influence classification performance. To address this issue, we employ structural identifiability analysis to explicitly relate parameter configurations that are associated with identical system outputs. Using the derived relations in classifier training, we demonstrate that this method significantly improves the classifier's ability to generalize to unseen data on a number of example models from the biomedical domain. This effect is especially pronounced when the number of training instances is limited. Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for structural identifiability, a topic that has received relatively little attention from the machine learning community.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain a widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not designed to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches for time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually incorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a novel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism, similar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model learns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state updates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent. We provide a proof-of-concept study on synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications.

Using multiple hand sensors, multivariate time series data are being captured. Given a number of possible actions on a number of objects, the goal is to classify the multivariate time series data, where the class shall be predicted as early as possible. Many machine-learning methods have been developed for such classification tasks, where different approaches produce favorable solutions on different data sets. We, therefore, employ an ensemble approach that includes and weights different approaches. To provide a trustworthy classification production, we present the XMTC tool that incorporates coordinated multiple-view visualizations to analyze the predictions. Temporal accuracy plots, confusion matrix heatmaps, temporal confidence heatmaps, and partial dependence plots allow for the identification of the best trade-off between early prediction and prediction quality, the detection and analysis of challenging classification conditions, and the investigation of the prediction evolution in an overview and detail manner. We employ XMTC to real-world HCI data in multiple scenarios and show that good classification predictions can be achieved early on with our classifier as well as which conditions are easy to distinguish, which multivariate time series measurements impose challenges, and which features have most impact.</p></details> |  |

While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, most of these systems face two critical challenges: the lack of interpretability as black-box models and limited functionality, offering only classification or retrieval capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel interpretable violence detection system, termed the Three-in-One (TIO) System. The TIO system integrates knowledge graphs (KG) and graph attention networks (GAT) to provide three core functionalities: detection, retrieval, and explanation. Specifically, the system processes each video frame along with text descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM) for videos containing potential violent behavior. It employs ImageBind to generate high-dimensional embeddings for constructing a knowledge graph, uses GAT for reasoning, and applies lightweight time series modules to extract video embedding features. The final step connects a classifier and retriever for multi-functional outputs. The interpretability of KG enables the system to verify the reasoning process behind each output. Additionally, the paper introduces several lightweight methods to reduce the resource consumption of the TIO system and enhance its efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the XD-Violence and UCF-Crime datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. A case study further reveals an intriguing phenomenon: as the number of bystanders increases, the occurrence of violent behavior tends to decrease.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This study compares advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for accelerating unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using small datasets based on a challenging natural convection flow dataset. The advanced architectures such as autoencoders, UNet, and ConvLSTM-UNet, were evaluated under identical conditions to determine their predictive accuracy and robustness in autoregressive time-series predictions. ConvLSTM-UNet consistently outperformed other models, particularly in difference value calculation, achieving lower maximum errors and stable residuals. However, error accumulation remains a challenge, limiting reliable predictions to approximately 10 timesteps. This highlights the need for enhanced strategies to improve long-term prediction stability. The novelty of this work lies in its fair comparison of state-of-the-art CNN models within the RePIT framework, demonstrating their potential for accelerating CFD simulations while identifying limitations under small data conditions. Future research will focus on exploring alternative models, such as graph neural networks and implicit neural representations. These efforts aim to develop a robust hybrid approach for long-term unsteady CFD acceleration, contributing to practical applications in virtual nuclear reactor.</p></details> | 9 figures, 3 Tables |

An alternative cause of randomness is chaos, which can be an important component of chaotic time series. One of the existing methods to deal with this type of data is the use of the evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFSs), which have been proven to be a powerful class of models for time series forecasting, due to their autonomy to handle the data and highly complex problems in real-world applications. However, due to its working structure, type-2 fuzzy sets can outperform type-1 fuzzy sets for highly uncertain scenarios. We then propose ePL-KRLS-FSM+, an enhanced class of evolving fuzzy modeling approach that combines participatory learning (PL), a kernel recursive least squares method (KRLS), type-2 fuzzy logic and data transformation into fuzzy sets (FSs). This improvement allows to create and measure type-2 fuzzy sets for better handling uncertainties in the data, generating a model that can predict chaotic data with increased accuracy. The model is evaluated using two complex datasets: the chaotic time series Mackey-Glass delay differential equation with different degrees of chaos, and the main stock index of the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index - TAIEX. Model performance is compared to related state-of-the-art rule-based eFS models and classical approaches and is analyzed in terms of error metrics, runtime and the number of final rules. Forecasting results show that the proposed model is competitive and performs consistently compared with type-1 models, also outperforming other forecasting methods by showing the lowest error metrics and number of final rules.</p></details> |  |

Our previous work was the first to demonstrate that supervised neural network time series classification (NN TSC) could rapidly predict the tactics of swarming autonomous agents in military contexts, providing intelligence to inform counter-maneuvers. However, most autonomous interactions, especially military engagements, are fraught with uncertainty, raising questions about the practicality of using a pretrained classifier. This article addresses that challenge by leveraging expected operational variations to construct a richer dataset, resulting in a more robust NN with improved inference performance in scenarios characterized by significant uncertainties. Specifically, diverse datasets are created by simulating variations in defender numbers, defender motions, and measurement noise levels. Key findings indicate that robust NNs trained on an enriched dataset exhibit enhanced classification accuracy and offer operational flexibility, such as reducing resources required and offering adherence to trajectory constraints. Furthermore, we present a new framework for optimally deploying a trained NN by the defenders. The framework involves optimizing defender trajectories that elicit adversary responses that maximize the probability of correct NN tactic classification while also satisfying operational constraints imposed on the defenders.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, data are often distributed across multiple entities (e.g., companies, devices) that seek to collaboratively learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network while preserving data privacy and security. More importantly, due to the presence of diverse clients, the data may follow different distributions, resulting in data heterogeneity. This heterogeneity poses additional challenges for centralized approaches. In this study, we first introduce a federated learning approach for estimating the structure of a Dynamic Bayesian Network from homogeneous time series data that are horizontally distributed across different parties. We then extend this approach to heterogeneous time series data by incorporating a proximal operator as a regularization term in a personalized federated learning framework. To this end, we propose \texttt{FDBNL} and \texttt{PFDBNL}, which leverage continuous optimization, ensuring that only model parameters are exchanged during the optimization process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in scenarios with many clients and limited individual sample sizes.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[A Multi-Task Learning Approach to Linear Multivariate Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03571v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03571v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently. This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/azencot-group/MTLinear</p></details> |  |

The forecasting solution includes features such as weather conditions, calendar events, and time-of-day patterns. Results demonstrate the strong performance of ML-based meta-models and highlight the emerging potential of foundation models like Chronos and TimesFM, which deliver competitive performance with minimal feature engineering, leveraging only the pre-trained model (zero-shot inference).

However, limited data availability during emerging outbreaks and the complex interaction between environmental factors and disease dynamics present significant challenges for effective forecasting. In response, we introduce CAPE, a novel epidemic pre-training framework designed to harness extensive disease datasets from diverse regions and integrate environmental factors directly into the modeling process for more informed decision-making on downstream diseases. Based on a covariate adjustment framework, CAPE utilizes pre-training combined with hierarchical environment contrasting to identify universal patterns across diseases while estimating latent environmental influences. We have compiled a diverse collection of epidemic time series datasets and validated the effectiveness of CAPE under various evaluation scenarios, including full-shot, few-shot, zero-shot, cross-location, and cross-disease settings, where it outperforms the leading baseline by an average of 9.9% in full-shot and 14.3% in zero-shot settings. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty and ridge regularization, KANGCI effectively infers the Granger causality from time series. Additionally, we propose an algorithm based on time-reversed Granger causality that automatically selects causal relationships with better inference performance from the original or time-reversed time series or integrates the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, Gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, VAR, and real-world EEG datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.</p></details> |  |

Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the feasibility of using formal software verification, specifically the SPARK framework for Ada, to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated code. We present Marmaragan, a tool that leverages an LLM in order to generate SPARK annotations for existing programs, enabling formal verification of the code. The tool is benchmarked on a curated set of SPARK programs, with annotations selectively removed to test specific capabilities. The performance of Marmaragan with GPT-4o on the benchmark is promising, with correct annotations having been generated for 50.7% of the benchmark cases. The results establish a foundation for future work on combining the power of LLMs with the reliability of formal software verification.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging a two-tiered structure, Glinthawk optimizes the utilization of the high-end accelerators ("Tier 1") by offloading the attention mechanism to lower-end compute tier ("Tier 2"). This separation allows the memory demand of the attention, known as the key-value cache, to scale independently from the model weights, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient accelerator usage. Prototyped with NVIDIA T4 GPUs and standard CPU VMs, Glinthawk improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$, compared to paged attention baselines. For long sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-focused applications such as batch processing. The prototype is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk.</p></details> |  |

When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.</p></details> |  |

Importantly, our framework is not confined to a singular design process but is adaptable across various processes.</p></details> |  |

To address such limitation, we propose ProjectTest, a project-level benchmark for unit test generation covering Python, Java, and JavaScript. ProjectTest features 20 moderate-sized and high-quality projects per language. We evaluate nine frontier LLMs on ProjectTest and the results show that all frontier LLMs tested exhibit moderate performance on ProjectTest on Python and Java, highlighting the difficulty of ProjectTest. We also conduct a thorough error analysis, which shows that even frontier LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, have significant simple errors, including compilation and cascade errors. Motivated by this observation, we further evaluate all frontier LLMs under manual error-fixing and self-error-fixing scenarios to assess their potential when equipped with error-fixing mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current approaches for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computational cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking, with only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematics</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.</p></details> |  |

However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>work ...</summary><p>work in progress. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.09673 by other authors</p></details> |

Sketches, as compact data structures that offer low memory overhead with bounded accuracy, have emerged as a promising solution for network stream mining. Recent studies attempt to optimize sketches using machine learning; however, these approaches face the challenges of lacking adaptivity to dynamic networks and incurring high training costs. In this paper, we propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage. Furthermore, it leverages fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to reliably estimate flow sizes. We evaluate LLM-Sketch on three representative tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLM-Sketch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving a $7.5\times$ accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |

Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025; 28 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

To address this gap, we introduce PerCul, a carefully constructed dataset designed to assess the sensitivity of LLMs toward Persian culture. PerCul features story-based, multiple-choice questions that capture culturally nuanced scenarios. Unlike existing benchmarks, PerCul is curated with input from native Persian annotators to ensure authenticity and to prevent the use of translation as a shortcut. We evaluate several state-of-the-art multilingual and Persian-specific LLMs, establishing a foundation for future research in cross-cultural NLP evaluation.

We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |

While most implementations seek to exploit or evaluate LLM-agentic reasoning, they often do so with a weak notion of agency and simplified architectures. We implement a role-based multi-agent strategic interaction framework tailored to sophisticated recursive reasoners, providing the means for systematic in-depth development and evaluation of strategic reasoning. Our game environment is governed by the umpire responsible for facilitating games, from matchmaking through move validation to environment management. Players incorporate state-of-the-art LLMs in their decision mechanism, relying on a formal hypergame-based model of hierarchical beliefs. We use one-shot, 2-player beauty contests to evaluate the recursive reasoning capabilities of the latest LLMs, providing a comparison to an established baseline model from economics and data from human experiments. Furthermore, we introduce the foundations of an alternative semantic measure of reasoning to the k-level theory. Our experiments show that artificial reasoners can outperform the baseline model in terms of both approximating human behaviour and reaching the optimal solution.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental question arises: how do LLMs achieve such robust multilingual capabilities? For non-Latin script languages, we investigate the role of romanization - the representation of non-Latin scripts using Latin characters - as a bridge in multilingual processing. Using mechanistic interpretability techniques, we analyze next-token generation and find that intermediate layers frequently represent target words in romanized form before transitioning to native script, a phenomenon we term Latent Romanization. Further, through activation patching experiments, we demonstrate that LLMs encode semantic concepts similarly across native and romanized scripts, suggesting a shared underlying representation. Additionally in translation towards non Latin languages, our findings reveal that when the target language is in romanized form, its representations emerge earlier in the model's layers compared to native script. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of multilingual representation in LLMs and highlight the implicit role of romanization in facilitating language transfer. Our work provides new directions for potentially improving multilingual language modeling and interpretability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 18 figures |

Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> |

For these manufacturers, a first step towards this goal is to identify the environmental impact of the individual components of their products. We propose a system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically map components from manufacturer Bills of Materials (BOMs) to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) database entries by using LLMs to expand on available component information. Our approach reduces the need for manual data processing, paving the way for more accessible sustainability practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Can Easily Learn to Reason from Demonstrations Structure, not content, is what matters!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07374v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07374v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models. This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model. Codes are available at https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two curated datasets containing posts from X (formerly Twitter) which capture economy-related narratives (Data will be shared upon paper acceptance). Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, we extract and summarize narratives from the tweets. We test their predictive power for $\textit{macroeconomic}$ forecasting by incorporating the tweets' or the extracted narratives' representations in downstream financial prediction tasks. Our work highlights the challenges in improving macroeconomic models with narrative data, paving the way for the research community to realistically address this important challenge. From a scientific perspective, our investigation offers valuable insights and NLP tools for narrative extraction and summarization using Large Language Models (LLMs), contributing to future research on the role of narratives in economics.</p></details> |  |

Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), an uncertainty-aware approach, enables uncertainty estimation in a single forward pass, making it a promising method for calibrating fine-tuned LLMs. However, despite its computational efficiency, EDL is prone to overfitting, as its training objective can result in overly concentrated probability distributions. To mitigate this, we propose regularizing EDL by incorporating an information bottleneck (IB). Our approach IB-EDL suppresses spurious information in the evidence generated by the model and encourages truly predictive information to influence both the predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments across various fine-tuned LLMs and tasks demonstrate that IB-EDL outperforms both existing EDL and non-EDL approaches. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, IB-EDL facilitates their broader adoption in domains requiring high levels of confidence calibration.

Current benchmark-based methods often rely on static and costly datasets, are misaligned with practical user needs, and lack flexibility across domains. To address these limitations, we revisit the evaluation process and introduce two key concepts: Benchmark+, which extends the traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting analysis from broader perspectives. We propose TestAgent, an agent-based evaluation framework that implements these concepts using retrieval-augmented generation and reinforcement learning. TestAgent enables automatic dynamic benchmark generation and in-depth assessment across diverse vertical domain scenarios. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing multiple vertical domain evaluations to converting static benchmarks into dynamic forms demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent. This work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs and highlights a pathway for dynamic and domain-adaptive assessments.</p></details> |  |

Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust medical professionals, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However, increased patient loads on experts has led to reduced communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we developed CataractBot. CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly using an LLM to query a curated knowledge base, and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. It has multimodal and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 49 patients and attendants, 4 doctors, and 2 patient coordinators, CataractBot demonstrated potential, providing anytime accessibility, saving time, accommodating diverse literacy levels, alleviating power differences, and adding a privacy layer between patients and doctors. Users reported that their trust in the system was established through expert verification. Broadly, our results could inform future work on designing expert-mediated LLM bots.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have been exploring ways to guide models to generate more complex CoT processes to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs, such as long CoT and the test-time scaling law. However, for most models and tasks, does an increase in CoT length consistently lead to improved reasoning accuracy? In this paper, we observe a nuanced relationship: as the number of reasoning steps increases, performance initially improves but eventually decreases. To understand this phenomenon, we provide a piece of evidence that longer reasoning processes are increasingly susceptible to noise. We theoretically prove the existence of an optimal CoT length and derive a scaling law for this optimal length based on model capability and task difficulty. Inspired by our theory, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets and propose Length-filtered Vote to alleviate the effects of excessively long or short CoTs. Our findings highlight the critical need to calibrate CoT length to align with model capabilities and task demands, offering a principled framework for optimizing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite their progress, LLMs are prone to hallucinations, producing responses that may not be dependable if the models lack sufficient grounding knowledge. To mitigate this issue, methods for estimating uncertainty have been adopted, with a focus on critical tokens as indicators of reliability. Nevertheless, probability-based approaches have shown limitations in assessing token-level reliability due to the erosion of evidence strength information acquired during training. In this paper, we introduce Logits-induced Token Uncertainty (LogU), a novel framework designed to estimate token-specific uncertainty in LLMs in real time, without the need for multiple sampling rounds. By leveraging evidence modeling for the implementation of LogU, we utilize the derived uncertainty measures to steer downstream tasks. Our experimental findings highlight the substantial effectiveness and potential of LogU, marking a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of model hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some data errors in Table 1</p></details> |

Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.7%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@3200).</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Detecting such manipulations traditionally relies on the manual effort of experienced experts, presenting significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-driven framework that automates the detection of price oracle manipulations by leveraging the complementary strengths of different LLM models (LLMs). Our approach begins with domain-specific knowledge extraction, where an LLM model synthesizes precise insights about price oracle vulnerabilities from top-tier academic papers, eliminating the need for profound expertise from developers or auditors. This knowledge forms the foundation for a second LLM model to generate structured, context-aware chain of thought prompts, which guide a third LLM model in accurately identifying manipulation patterns in smart contracts. We validate the effectiveness of framework through experiments on 60 known vulnerabilities from 46 real-world DeFi attacks or projects spanning 2021 to 2023. The best performing combination of LLMs (Haiku-Haiku-4o-mini) identified by AiRacleX demonstrate a 2.58-times improvement in recall (0.667 vs 0.259) compared to the state-of-the-art tool GPTScan, while maintaining comparable precision. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of replacing commercial models with open-source alternatives, enhancing privacy and security for developers.</p></details> |  |

The ability to selectively remove knowledge from LLMs is, therefore, a highly desirable capability. In this paper, we propose LUNAR, a novel unlearning methodology grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis. LUNAR operates by redirecting the representations of unlearned data to regions that trigger the model's inherent ability to express its inability to answer. LUNAR achieves state-of-the-art unlearning performance while significantly enhancing the controllability of the unlearned model during inference. Specifically, LUNAR achieves between 2.9x to 11.7x improvements on combined "unlearning efficacy" and "model utility" score ("Deviation Score") on the PISTOL dataset across various base models. We also demonstrate, through quantitative analysis and qualitative examples, LUNAR's superior controllability in generating coherent and contextually aware responses, mitigating undesired side effects of existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that LUNAR is robust against white-box adversarial attacks and versatile in handling real-world scenarios, such as processing sequential unlearning requests.</p></details> |  |

Yet its quadratic complexity hinders efficiency and scalability, especially for long-context processing. A promising approach is to leverage sparsity in attention. However, existing sparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or heuristics at the attention head level, struggling to adapt dynamically to different contexts efficiently. We propose SeerAttention, a simple yet effective attention mechanism that directly learns the block-level attention sparsity from the LLM itself. Inspired by the gating mechanism in Mixture of Experts (MoE), SeerAttention augments the conventional attention with a learnable gate that selectively activates important blocks within the attention map. Specifically, the gate first pools the query (Q) and key (K) tensors along the sequence dimension and processes them through learnable linear layers. The resulting matrices are then multiplied together to produce the gating scores, which are used to predict block-level attention sparsity. Combined with our block-sparse FlashAttention kernel, SeerAttention can achieve significant speedup on GPUs. When applied to pre-trained LLMs, SeerAttention only requires training the gate parameters in a lightweight self-distillation manner, allowing rapid convergence. Our evaluation results demonstrate that SeerAttention achieves better model accuracy and lower latency for long-context pre-filling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Inference-time computation methods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as they can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or requiring additional training. However, these techniques come with implementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the proof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their computational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation strategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current methods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate solutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on reward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on optimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts, hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g., self-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000 A100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models (e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation studies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance performance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by up to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for inference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative methods across eight reasoning tasks. These findings provide a stronger foundation for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/benchmark_inference_time_computation_LL</p></details> |  |

In cognitive research, the latter ability is referred to as fluid intelligence, which is considered to be critical for assessing human intelligence. Recent research on fluid intelligence assessments has highlighted significant deficiencies in LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we analyze the challenges LLMs face in demonstrating fluid intelligence through controlled experiments, using the most representative ARC task as an example. Our study revealed three major limitations in existing LLMs: limited ability for skill composition, unfamiliarity with abstract input formats, and the intrinsic deficiency of left-to-right decoding.

However, their performance can be suboptimal in such data annotation tasks. We introduce a novel technique Perceived Confidence Scoring (PCS) that evaluates LLM's confidence for its classification of an input by leveraging Metamorphic Relations (MRs). The MRs generate semantically equivalent yet textually mutated versions of the input. Following the principles of Metamorphic Testing (MT), the mutated versions are expected to have annotation labels similar to the input. By analyzing the consistency of LLM responses across these variations, PCS computes a confidence score based on the frequency of predicted labels. PCS can be used both for single LLM and multiple LLM settings (e.g., majority voting). We introduce an algorithm Perceived Differential Evolution (PDE) that determines the optimal weights assigned to the MRs and the LLMs for a classification task. Empirical evaluation shows PCS significantly improves zero-shot accuracy for Llama-3-8B-Instruct (4.96%) and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (10.52%), with Gemma-2-9b-it showing a 9.39% gain. When combining all three models, PCS significantly outperforms majority voting by 7.75%.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, there have not been efforts to explore such collaborative writing. We take the next step beyond human-LLM collaboration to explore this multi-LLM scenario by generating the first exclusively LLM-generated collaborative stories dataset called CollabStory. We focus on single-author to multi-author (up to 5 LLMs) scenarios, where multiple LLMs co-author stories. We generate over 32k stories using open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. Further, we take inspiration from the PAN tasks that have set the standard for human-human multi-author writing tasks and analysis. We extend their authorship-related tasks for multi-LLM settings and present baselines for LLM-LLM collaboration. We find that current baselines are not able to handle this emerging scenario. Thus, CollabStory is a resource that could help propel an understanding as well as the development of new techniques to discern the use of multiple LLMs. This is crucial to study in the context of writing tasks since LLM-LLM collaboration could potentially overwhelm ongoing challenges related to plagiarism detection, credit assignment, maintaining academic integrity in educational settings, and addressing copyright infringement concerns.

These models often rely on single-turn interactions and lack the ability to refine their predictions through follow-up questions. Additionally, their responses frequently contain complex medical terminology, making them less accessible to non-medical users and creating barriers to effective communication. In this paper, we introduce Ask Patients with Patience (APP), the first multi-turn dialogue that enables LLMs to iteratively refine diagnoses based on grounded reasoning. By integrating medical guidelines and entropy minimization, APP improves both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, it features human-centric communication that bridges the gap between user comprehension and medical terminology, significantly enhancing user accessibility and engagement. We evaluated APP using a subset of the ReMeDi dataset, comparing it with single-turn and traditional multi-turn LLM baselines. APP achieved higher similarity scores in diagnosis predictions, demonstrating better alignment with ground truth diagnoses. Entropy analysis showed that APP reduces diagnostic uncertainty more rapidly across iterations, increasing confidence in its predictions. APP also excels in user accessibility and empathy, further bridging the gap between complex medical language and user understanding.

A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose novel batching and scheduling algorithms that minimize inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory. We analyze both semi-online and fully online scheduling models, and our results are threefold. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves exact optimality in terms of average latency in the semi-online prompt arrival model. Second, in the fully online case with a stochastic prompt arrival, we introduce an efficient online scheduling algorithm with constant regret. Third, we prove that no algorithm (deterministic or randomized) can achieve a constant competitive ratio in fully online adversarial settings. Our empirical evaluations on a public LLM inference dataset, using the Llama-70B model on A100 GPUs, show that our approach significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms used currently in practice, achieving lower latency while reducing energy consumption. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.</p></details> | 32pages, 17 figures |

However, the safety of code LLMs remains under-explored, posing potential risks as insecure code generated by these models may introduce vulnerabilities into real-world systems. Previous work proposes to collect security-focused instruction-tuning dataset from real-world vulnerabilities. It is constrained by the data sparsity of vulnerable code, and has limited applicability in the iterative post-training workflows of modern LLMs. In this paper, we propose ProSec, a novel proactive security alignment approach designed to align code LLMs with secure coding practices. ProSec systematically exposes the vulnerabilities in a code LLM by synthesizing error-inducing coding scenarios from Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), and generates fixes to vulnerable code snippets, allowing the model to learn secure practices through advanced preference learning objectives. The scenarios synthesized by ProSec triggers 25 times more vulnerable code than a normal instruction-tuning dataset, resulting in a security-focused alignment dataset 7 times larger than the previous work. Experiments show that models trained with ProSec are 25.2% to 91.4% more secure compared to previous work without degrading models' utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

These varieties can affect the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models, including large language models (LLMs), which are often trained on data from widely spoken varieties. This paper introduces a novel and cost-effective approach to benchmark model performance across language varieties. We argue that international online review platforms, such as Booking.com, can serve as effective data sources for constructing datasets that capture comments in different language varieties from similar real-world scenarios, like reviews for the same hotel with the same rating using the same language (e.g., Mandarin Chinese) but different language varieties (e.g., Taiwan Mandarin, Mainland Mandarin). To prove this concept, we constructed a contextually aligned dataset comprising reviews in Taiwan Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin and tested six LLMs in a sentiment analysis task. Our results show that LLMs consistently underperform in Taiwan Mandarin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), theme track</p></details> |

These models, trained on extensive datasets that include code repositories, exhibit remarkable capabilities for SE tasks. However, evaluating their effectiveness poses significant challenges, primarily due to the potential overlap between the datasets used for training and those employed for evaluation. To address this issue, we introduce SnipGen, a comprehensive repository mining framework designed to leverage prompt engineering across various downstream tasks for code generation. SnipGen aims to mitigate data contamination by generating robust testbeds and crafting tailored data points to assist researchers and practitioners in evaluating LLMs for code-related tasks. In our exploratory study, SnipGen mined approximately 227K data points from 338K recent code changes in GitHub commits, focusing on method-level granularity. SnipGen features a collection of prompt templates that can be combined to create a Chain-of-Thought-like sequence of prompts, enabling a nuanced assessment of LLMs' code generation quality. By providing the mining tool, the methodology, and the dataset, SnipGen empowers researchers and practitioners to rigorously evaluate and interpret LLMs' performance in software engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 0 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Cybersecurity is one of the key sectors where LLMs can be and/or are already being used. There are a number of problems that inhibit the adoption of trustworthy Gen AI and LLMs in cybersecurity and such other critical areas. One of the key challenge to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs is: how consistent an LLM is in its responses? In this paper, we have analyzed and developed a formal definition of consistency of responses of LLMs. We have formally defined what is consistency of responses and then develop a framework for consistency evaluation. The paper proposes two approaches to validate consistency: self-validation, and validation across multiple LLMs. We have carried out extensive experiments for several LLMs such as GPT4oMini, GPT3.5, Gemini, Cohere, and Llama3, on a security benchmark consisting of several cybersecurity questions: informational and situational. Our experiments corroborate the fact that even though these LLMs are being considered and/or already being used for several cybersecurity tasks today, they are often inconsistent in their responses, and thus are untrustworthy and unreliable for cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

We then applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to these models to identify specific words associated with DIF. The data included 42,180 items designed for English language arts and mathematics summative state assessments among students in grades 3 to 11. Prediction $R^2$ ranged from .04 to .32 among eight focal and reference group pairs. Our findings suggest that many words associated with DIF reflect minor sub-domains included in the test blueprint by design, rather than construct-irrelevant item content that should be removed from assessments. This may explain why qualitative reviews of DIF items often yield confusing or inconclusive results. Our approach can be used to screen words associated with DIF during the item-writing process for immediate revision, or help review traditional DIF analysis results by highlighting key words in the text. Extensions of this research can enhance the fairness of assessment programs, especially those that lack resources to build high-quality items, and among smaller subpopulations where we do not have sufficient sample sizes for traditional DIF analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Many biological systems solve these challenges with episodic memory, which supports single-shot learning of instance-specific contexts. Inspired by this, we present an episodic memory framework for LLM agents, centered around five key properties of episodic memory that underlie adaptive and context-sensitive behavior. With various research efforts already partially covering these properties, this position paper argues that now is the right time for an explicit, integrated focus on episodic memory to catalyze the development of long-term agents. To this end, we outline a roadmap that unites several research directions under the goal to support all five properties of episodic memory for more efficient long-term LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

We aim to uncover the algorithmic framework for training LRMs. Methods like self-consistency, PRM, and AlphaZero suggest reasoning as guided search. We ask: what is the simplest, most scalable way to enable search in LLMs? We propose a post-training framework called Reinforcement Learning via Self-Play (RLSP). RLSP involves three steps: (1) supervised fine-tuning with human or synthetic demonstrations of the reasoning process, (2) using an exploration reward signal to encourage diverse and efficient reasoning behaviors, and (3) RL training with an outcome verifier to ensure correctness while preventing reward hacking. Our key innovation is to decouple exploration and correctness signals during PPO training, carefully balancing them to improve performance and efficiency. Empirical studies in the math domain show that RLSP improves reasoning. On the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, RLSP can boost performance by 23% in MATH-500 test set; On AIME 2024 math problems, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct improved by 10% due to RLSP. However, a more important finding of this work is that the models trained using RLSP, even with the simplest exploration reward that encourages the model to take more intermediate steps, showed several emergent behaviors such as backtracking, exploration of ideas, and verification. These findings demonstrate that RLSP framework might be enough to enable emergence of complex reasoning abilities in LLMs when scaled. Lastly, we propose a theory as to why RLSP search strategy is more suitable for LLMs inspired by a remarkable result that says CoT provably increases computational power of LLMs, which grows as the number of steps in CoT \cite{li2024chain,merrill2023expresssive}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract shortened for arXiv</p></details> |

We train our ReasonFlux-32B model with only 8 GPUs and introduces three innovations: (i) a structured and generic thought template library, containing around 500 high-level thought templates capable of generalizing to similar or relevant reasoning problems; (ii) performing hierarchical reinforcement learning on a sequence of thought templates instead of long CoTs, optimizing a base LLM to plan out an optimal template trajectory for gradually handling complex problems; (iii) a brand new inference scaling system that enables hierarchical LLM reasoning by adaptively scaling thought templates at inference time. With a template trajectory containing sequential thought templates, our ReasonFlux-32B significantly advances math reasoning capabilities to state-of-the-art levels. Notably, on the MATH benchmark, it achieves an accuracy of 91.2% and surpasses o1-preview by 6.7%.

To address this, we first construct a high-quality medical dataset and conduct analysis to ensure its quality. In order to leverage the generalization capability of multilingual LLMs to efficiently scale to more resource-constrained languages, we explore the internal information flow of LLMs from a multilingual perspective using Mixture of Experts (MoE) modularity. Technically, we propose a novel MoE routing method that employs language-specific experts and cross-lingual routing. Inspired by circuit theory, our routing analysis revealed a Spread Out in the End information flow mechanism: while earlier layers concentrate cross-lingual information flow, the later layers exhibit language-specific divergence. This insight directly led to the development of the Post-MoE architecture, which applies sparse routing only in the later layers while maintaining dense others. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach enhances the generalization of multilingual models to other languages while preserving interpretability. Finally, to efficiently scale the model to 50 languages, we introduce the concept of language family experts, drawing on linguistic priors, which enables scaling the number of languages without adding additional parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches often require detailed knowledge of a graph querying language, limiting the ability for users -- even experts -- to acquire valuable insights from KGs. LinkQ simplifies this process by implementing a multistep protocol in which the LLM interprets a user's question, then systematically converts it into a well-formed query. LinkQ helps users iteratively refine any open-ended questions into precise ones, supporting both targeted and exploratory analysis. Further, LinkQ guards against the LLM hallucinating outputs by ensuring users' questions are only ever answered from ground truth KG data. We demonstrate the efficacy of LinkQ through a qualitative study with five KG practitioners. Our results indicate that practitioners find LinkQ effective for KG question-answering, and desire future LLM-assisted exploratory data analysis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open-...</summary><p>Open-source code: https://github.com/mit-ll/linkq</p></details> |

Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after hundreds of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that progress on tamper-resistance is possible, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://www.tamper-resistant-safeguards.com</p></details> |

Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation- and LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%).

Close-ended measurements evaluate the factuality of responses but lack expressiveness. Open-ended capture the model's capacity to produce discourse responses but are harder to assess for correctness. These two approaches are commonly used, either independently or together, though their relationship remains poorly understood. This work is focused on the healthcare domain, where both factuality and discourse matter greatly. It introduces a comprehensive, multi-axis suite for healthcare LLM evaluation, exploring correlations between open and close benchmarks and metrics. Findings include blind spots and overlaps in current methodologies. As an updated sanity check, we release a new medical benchmark--CareQA--, with both open and closed variants. Finally, we propose a novel metric for open-ended evaluations --Relaxed Perplexity-- to mitigate the identified limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs inherently reflect biases present in their training data, leading to a critical challenge: when these models generate synthetic data for training, they may propagate and amplify their inherent biases that can significantly impact model fairness and robustness on downstream tasks--a phenomenon we term bias inheritance. This work presents the first systematic investigation in understanding, analyzing, and mitigating bias inheritance. We study this problem by fine-tuning LLMs with a combined dataset consisting of original and LLM-augmented data, where bias ratio represents the proportion of augmented data. Through systematic experiments across 10 classification and generation tasks, we analyze how 6 different types of biases manifest at varying bias ratios. Our results reveal that bias inheritance has nuanced effects on downstream tasks, influencing both classification tasks and generation tasks differently. Then, our analysis identifies three key misalignment factors: misalignment of values, group data, and data distributions. Based on these insights, we propose three mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches. Experiments demonstrate that these strategies also work differently on various tasks and bias, indicating the substantial challenges to fully mitigate bias inheritance.

CFPO leverages natural language mutations to explore content variations and employs a dynamic format exploration strategy that systematically evaluates diverse format options. Our extensive evaluations across multiple tasks and open-source LLMs demonstrate that CFPO demonstrates measurable performance improvements compared to content-only optimization methods.

However, both approaches are computationally expensive and slow, often requiring significant resources to generate a single successful attack. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of these methods arises from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem itself. To address this gap, we approach the jailbreak problem as an alignment problem, leading us to propose LIAR (Leveraging Inference time Alignment to jailbReak), a fast and efficient best-of-N approach tailored for jailbreak attacks. LIAR offers several key advantages: it eliminates the need for additional training, operates in a fully black-box setting, significantly reduces computational overhead, and produces more human-readable adversarial prompts while maintaining competitive attack success rates. Our results demonstrate that a best-of-N approach is a simple yet highly effective strategy for evaluating the robustness of aligned LLMs, achieving attack success rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a 10x improvement in perplexity and a significant speedup in Time-to-Attack, reducing execution time from tens of hours to seconds. Additionally, We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed LIAR. Our work highlights the potential of efficient, alignment-based jailbreak strategies for assessing and stress-testing AI safety measures.</p></details> |  |

However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning. Our framework enables leveraging legal knowledge to enhance generation diversity and introduces a refinement and verification process to ensure the quality of generated data. Moreover, we expand the generated dataset to further enhance the LLM reasoning capabilities. Using KgDG, we create a synthetic legal reasoning dataset containing 50K high-quality examples. Our trained model LawGPT outperforms existing legal-specific LLMs and achieves performance comparable to proprietary LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of KgDG and LawGPT. Our code and resources is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KgDG-45F5 .</p></details> | Preprint |

Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP synthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the foundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art models may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data algorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the Private Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was designed for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our extension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance measure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of algorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries to the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not always improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established baselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the underlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more effective for this application.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures.

Naija is a Nigerian Pidgin spoken by approximately 120M speakers and it is a mixed language (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are some online platforms (e.g., Wikipedia), publishing in written Naija as well. West African Pidgin English (WAPE) is also spoken in Nigeria and it is used by BBC to broadcast news on the internet to a wider audience not only in Nigeria but also in other West African countries (e.g., Cameroon and Ghana). Through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments, our paper shows that these two pidgin varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is underrepresented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples. In addition to the statistical analyses, we also provide historical information on both pidgins as well as insights from the interviews conducted with volunteer Wikipedia contributors in Naija.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (findings)</p></details> |

In this study, we first characterize LLM-guided conversation into three fundamental components: (i) Goal Navigation; (ii) Context Management; (iii) Empathetic Engagement, and propose GuideLLM as an installation. We then implement an interviewing environment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation. Specifically, various topics are involved in this environment for comprehensive interviewing evaluation, resulting in around 1.4k turns of utterances, 184k tokens, and over 200 events mentioned during the interviewing for each chatbot evaluation. We compare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and autobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user proxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM behaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human participants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines. We then collect human feedback, preferences, and ratings regarding the qualities of conversation and autobiography. Experimental results indicate that GuideLLM significantly outperforms baseline LLMs in automatic evaluation and achieves consistent leading performances in human ratings.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages; the first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, specifically zkVM, with LLM-based chatbots. This integration enables privacy-preserving data sharing by verifying user traits without disclosing sensitive information. Our research introduces both an architecture and a prompting strategy for this approach. Through empirical evaluation, we clarify the current constraints and performance limitations of both zkVM and the proposed prompting strategy, thereby demonstrating their practical feasibility in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Short Paper Track</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the questions of assessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide high-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation faces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which prevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true label; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the performance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring the annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the annotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the behaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators. The model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize annotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the joint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a technical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the principal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent. We show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the continuous action space) is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log n})$ for the binary contracts and $\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number of samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known result of $\exp(-\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is discrete. Throughout the paper, we use real preference annotation data to accompany our discussions.</p></details> |  |

However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |

SeaExam draws from regional educational exams to form a comprehensive dataset that encompasses subjects such as local history and literature. In contrast, SeaBench is crafted around multi-turn, open-ended tasks that reflect daily interactions within SEA communities.

Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structural attributes}$ (response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavioral attributes}$ (answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggests potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.</p></details> |  |

However, it is computationally expensive, as sampling many of these (lengthy) paths is required to increase the chances that the correct answer emerges as the most frequent one. To address this, we introduce Confidence-Informed Self-Consistency (CISC). CISC performs a weighted majority vote based on confidence scores obtained directly from the model. By prioritizing high-confidence paths, it can identify the correct answer with a significantly smaller sample size. When tested on nine models and four datasets, CISC outperforms self-consistency in nearly all configurations, reducing the required number of reasoning paths by over 40% on average. In addition, we introduce the notion of within-question confidence evaluation, after showing that standard evaluation methods are poor predictors of success in distinguishing correct and incorrect answers to the same question. In fact, the most calibrated confidence method proved to be the least effective for CISC. Lastly, beyond these practical implications, our results and analyses show that LLMs can effectively judge the correctness of their own outputs, contributing to the ongoing debate on this topic.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.</p></details> | 25 pages |

In a controlled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using LLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and lowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes in autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation. We propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while considering users' self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the ideation outcomes.</p></details> | 16 pages |

An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06193v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06193v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns.

To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content.

This benchmark assesses LLMs from various aspects including accuracy, efficiency, and deployment script quality, aiming to explore their potential in conducting computer science research autonomously. We also introduce a novel framework, CSR-Agents, that utilizes multiple LLM agents to automate the deployment of GitHub code repositories of computer science research projects. Specifically, by checking instructions from markdown files and interpreting repository structures, the model generates and iteratively improves bash commands that set up the experimental environments and deploy the code to conduct research tasks. Preliminary results from CSR-Bench indicate that LLM agents can significantly enhance the workflow of repository deployment, thereby boosting developer productivity and improving the management of developmental workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models in both a zero-shot and few-shot setting. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform zero-shot LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. Moreover, few-shot in-context learning leads to only a marginal increase in the performance of LLMs, still lacking compared to SLMs. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques. Finally, we outline directions for future work on language model based content moderation.

Evaluating LLMs' Ability for Conceptual Combination with Property Type](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06086v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06086v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conceptual combination is a cognitive process that merges basic concepts, enabling the creation of complex expressions. During this process, the properties of combination (e.g., the whiteness of a peeled apple) can be inherited from basic concepts, newly emerge, or be canceled. However, previous studies have evaluated a limited set of properties and have not examined the generative process. To address this gap, we introduce the Conceptual Combination with Property Type dataset (CCPT), which consists of 12.3K annotated triplets of noun phrases, properties, and property types. Using CCPT, we establish three types of tasks to evaluate LLMs for conceptual combination thoroughly. Our key findings are threefold: (1) Our automatic metric grading property emergence and cancellation closely corresponds with human judgments.

Here we are concerned with LLMs in the context of evolving data requirements. For instance: batches of new data that are introduced periodically; subsets of data with user-based access controls; or requirements on dynamic removal of documents with guarantees that associated knowledge cannot be recalled. We wish to satisfy these requirements while at the same time ensuring a model does not forget old information when new data becomes available. To address these issues, we introduce AdapterSwap, a training and inference scheme that organizes knowledge from a data collection into a set of low-rank adapters, which are dynamically composed during inference. Our experiments demonstrate AdapterSwap's ability to support efficient continual learning, while also enabling organizations to have fine-grained control over data access and deletion.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the Conference on Applied Machine Learning in Information Security, 2024</p></details> |

This research systematically compares the performance of available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique linguistic characteristics.

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

To address this gap, HamRaz combines script-based dialogues with adaptive LLM role-playing, ensuring coherent and dynamic therapy interactions. We also introduce HamRazEval, a dual evaluation framework that measures conversational quality and therapeutic effectiveness using General Dialogue Metrics and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI). Experimental results show HamRaz outperforms conventional Script Mode and Two-Agent Mode, producing more empathetic, context-aware, and realistic therapy sessions. By releasing HamRaz, we contribute a culturally adapted, LLM-driven resource to advance AI-powered psychotherapy research in diverse communities.</p></details> |  |

However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone, regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce MetaChain-a Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an autonomous Agent Operating System, MetaChain comprises four key components: i) Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, MetaChain also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants. Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate MetaChain's effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

GenEOL significantly outperforms the existing training-free embedding methods by an average of 2.85 points across several LLMs on the sentence semantic text similarity (STS) benchmark. GenEOL also achieves notable gains in clustering, reranking, and pair-classification tasks from the MTEB benchmark.

A common solution to this memory challenge is offloading compute and data from the GPU to the CPU. However, this approach is hampered by the limited bandwidth of commodity hardware, which constrains communication between the CPU and GPU, and by slower matrix multiplications on the CPU. In this paper, we present an offloading framework, LSP-Offload, that enables near-native speed LLM fine-tuning on commodity hardware through learned sparse projectors. Our data-driven approach involves learning efficient sparse compressors that minimize communication with minimal precision loss. Additionally, we introduce a novel layer-wise communication schedule to maximize parallelism between communication and computation. As a result, our framework can fine-tune a 1.3 billion parameter model on a 4GB laptop GPU and a 6.7 billion parameter model on a 24GB NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading frameworks, our approach reduces end-to-end fine-tuning time by 33.1%-62.5% when converging to the same accuracy.

However, existing benchmarks often overlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address these, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents' sensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online shopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents' ability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and observations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the violation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that current LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent environments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over 40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting and fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary advantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances the agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting boosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight the importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social awareness during the development cycle.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages. MorphoMod offers a robust, adaptable solution for watermark removal and opens avenues for further advancements in image restoration and adversarial manipulation.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map.

However, thorough research remains difficult, particularly due to the lack of benchmark datasets. In this study, we propose a high-quality dataset automated cropping and filtering (HQ-ACF) pipeline. This pipeline leverages existing object detection datasets and other unlabeled images to automatically crop and filter high-quality human images. Using this pipeline, we constructed a person-based restoration with sophisticated objects and natural activities (\emph{PERSONA}) dataset, which includes training, validation, and test sets. The dataset significantly surpasses other human-related datasets in both quality and content richness. Finally, we propose \emph{OSDHuman}, a novel one-step diffusion model for human body restoration. Specifically, we propose a high-fidelity image embedder (HFIE) as the prompt generator to better guide the model with low-quality human image information, effectively avoiding misleading prompts. Experimental results show that OSDHuman outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input. We then use image restoration and video generation models to add more details as supervision. Finally, we introduce neural signed distance field (SDF) representation to achieve detailed shape reconstruction. Our framework generates meshes with complex details, well-structured geometry, coherent textures, and smooth transitions, resulting in visually appealing and eye-catching designs.

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Cross-Space Total Variation Regularization Model for Color Image Restoration with Quaternion Blur Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12114v3)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.12114v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959v2)** | 2025-01-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.06959v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was withdrawn due to a dispute among the authors regarding the content of the article</p></details> |

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images. Our method clearly outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page is available at: https://ygswu.github.io/NeuroPump.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project.

In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet.

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

While recent diffusion-based restoration methods, which leverage generative priors from text-to-image models, have made progress in recovering more realistic details, they still encounter "generative capability deactivation" when applied to out-of-distribution real-world data. To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Res-Captioner significantly enhances the generalization abilities of diffusion-based restoration models, while remaining fully plug-and-play.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |

However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications.

Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will release our code and data upon publication.</p></details> |  |

However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs</p></details> |

Traditional methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), linearly aggregate these parameters which are usually trained on heterogeneous data distributions, potentially overlooking the complex, high-dimensional nature of the parameter space. This can result in degraded performance of the aggregated model. While personalized FL approaches can mitigate the heterogeneous data issue to some extent, the limitation of linear aggregation remains unresolved. To alleviate this issue, we investigate the generative approach of diffusion model and propose a novel generative parameter aggregation framework for personalized FL, \texttt{pFedGPA}. In this framework, we deploy a diffusion model on the server to integrate the diverse parameter distributions and propose a parameter inversion method to efficiently generate a set of personalized parameters for each client. This inversion method transforms the uploaded parameters into a latent code, which is then aggregated through denoising sampling to produce the final personalized parameters. By encoding the dependence of a client's model parameters on the specific data distribution using the high-capacity diffusion model, \texttt{pFedGPA} can effectively decouple the complexity of the overall distribution of all clients' model parameters from the complexity of each individual client's parameter distribution. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across multiple datasets, surpassing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |

Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g. prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Secretly Models the Conditional Distributions of Clean Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03736v3)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.03736v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models with absorbing processes have shown promise in language modeling. The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between the marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called the concrete score. In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in absorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean data, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form. Motivated by this finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a dedicated diffusion model without time-condition that characterizes the time-independent conditional probabilities. Besides its simplicity, RADD can reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the time-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling interval, which enables sampling acceleration. Built upon the new perspective of conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the negative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an expected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve SOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling benchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale.

However, they all require huge computational costs due to the usage of large-scale pre-trained DMs, making it difficult to conduct full evaluation under strong attacks and compare with traditional CNN-based methods. Simply reducing the network size and timesteps in DMs could significantly harm the image generation quality, which invalidates previous frameworks. To alleviate this issue, we redesign the diffusion framework from generating high-quality images to predicting distinguishable image labels. Specifically, we employ an image translation framework to learn many-to-one mapping from input samples to designed orthogonal image labels. Based on this framework, we introduce an efficient Image-to-Image diffusion classifier with a pruned U-Net structure and reduced diffusion timesteps. Besides the framework, we redesign the optimization objective of DMs to fit the target of image classification, where a new classification loss is incorporated in the DM-based image translation framework to distinguish the generated label from those of other classes. We conduct sufficient evaluations of the proposed classifier under various attacks on popular benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves better adversarial robustness with fewer computational costs than DM-based and CNN-based methods.

Treating the generated sample as an unknown variable to infer lets us formulate the sampling process in the language of Bayesian probability. Our model uses a sequence of prediction and posterior update steps to narrow down the unknown sample from a broad initial belief. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish a connection between our model and diffusion models and show that it includes Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) as a special case. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over both BFNs and Variational Diffusion Models, achieving competitive likelihood scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.</p></details> |  |

Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs that limit their practicality in time-sensitive or resource-constrained settings. In this work, we introduce consistent diffusion samplers, a new class of samplers designed to generate high-fidelity samples in a single step. We first develop a distillation algorithm to train a consistent diffusion sampler from a pretrained diffusion model without pre-collecting large datasets of samples. Our algorithm leverages incomplete sampling trajectories and noisy intermediate states directly from the diffusion process. We further propose a method to train a consistent diffusion sampler from scratch, fully amortizing exploration by training a single model that both performs diffusion sampling and skips intermediate steps using a self-consistency loss. Through extensive experiments on a variety of unnormalized distributions, we show that our approach yields high-fidelity samples using less than 1% of the network evaluations required by traditional diffusion samplers.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this memorization stems from the overparameterization of deep models and propose that regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. Firstly, we empirically show that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the identification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality generation. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization and generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning. The parameter subsets discovered through MemControl achieve a superior tradeoff between generation quality and memorization. For the task of medical image generation, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art memorization mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as few as 0.019% of model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered parameter subsets are transferable to non-medical domains. Our framework is scalable to large datasets, agnostic to reward functions, and can be integrated with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically evaluate memorization in medical images and propose a targeted yet universal mitigation strategy.

However, these models are prone to training data memorization, posing significant risks to patient privacy. Synthetic chest X-ray generation is one of the most common applications in medical image analysis with the MIMIC-CXR dataset serving as the primary data repository for this task. This study adopts a data-driven approach and presents the first systematic attempt to identify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to training data memorization. Our analysis reveals an unexpected finding: prompts containing traces of de-identification procedures are among the most memorized, with de-identification markers contributing the most. Furthermore, we also find existing inference-time memorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently reduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens highlighting a broader issue in T2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. On this front, we propose actionable strategies to enhance privacy and improve the reliability of generative models in medical imaging. Finally, our results provide a foundation for future work on developing and benchmarking memorization mitigation techniques for synthetic chest X-ray generation using the MIMIC-CXR dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle to disentangle content and style from style-reference images, leading to issues such as content leakages. To address this issue, we propose a masking-based method that efficiently decouples content from style without the need of tuning any model parameters. By simply masking specific elements in the style reference's image features, we uncover a critical yet under-explored principle: guiding with appropriately-selected fewer conditions (e.g., dropping several image feature elements) can efficiently avoid unwanted content flowing into the diffusion models, enhancing the style transfer performances of text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we validate this finding both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments across various styles demonstrate the effectiveness of our masking-based method and support our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17670v2)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.17670v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items. Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets. The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of diffusion models has led to AI-generated content imitating artists' structural creations, yet effective detection methods are still lacking. In this paper, we define this phenomenon as "structural infringement" and propose a corresponding detection method. Additionally, we develop quantitative metrics and create manually annotated datasets for evaluation: the SIA dataset of synthesized data, and the SIR dataset of real data. Due to the current lack of datasets for structural infringement detection, we propose a new data synthesis strategy based on diffusion models and LLM, successfully training a structural infringement detection model. Experimental results show that our method can successfully detect structural infringements and achieve notable improvements on annotated test sets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

Yet, aligning these models with user's intentions still involves a laborious trial-and-error process, and this challenging alignment problem has attracted considerable attention from the research community. In this work, instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models, we use Mutual Information (MI) to guide model alignment. In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.

Despite extensive research on denoising across various timesteps and noise levels, a conflict persists regarding the relative difficulties of the denoising tasks. While various studies argue that lower timesteps present more challenging tasks, others contend that higher timesteps are more difficult. To address this conflict, our study undertakes a comprehensive examination of task difficulties, focusing on convergence behavior and changes in relative entropy between consecutive probability distributions across timesteps. Our observational study reveals that denoising at earlier timesteps poses challenges characterized by slower convergence and higher relative entropy, indicating increased task difficulty at these lower timesteps. Building on these observations, we introduce an easy-to-hard learning scheme, drawing from curriculum learning, to enhance the training process of diffusion models. By organizing timesteps or noise levels into clusters and training models with ascending orders of difficulty, we facilitate an order-aware training regime, progressing from easier to harder denoising tasks, thereby deviating from the conventional approach of training diffusion models simultaneously across all timesteps. Our approach leads to improved performance and faster convergence by leveraging benefits of curriculum learning, while maintaining orthogonality with existing improvements in diffusion training techniques. We validate these advantages through comprehensive experiments in image generation tasks, including unconditional, class-conditional, and text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |

Using in-silico trials to replace a part of physical clinical trials, e.g., leveraging advanced generative models to generate drug-influenced electrocardiograms (ECGs), seems an effective method to reduce financial risk and potential harm to trial participants. While existing generative models have demonstrated progress in ECG generation, they fall short in modeling drug reactions due to limited fidelity and inability to capture individualized drug response patterns. In this paper, we propose a Drug-Aware Diffusion Model (DADM), which could simulate individualized drug reactions while ensuring fidelity. To ensure fidelity, we construct a set of ordinary differential equations to provide external physical knowledge (EPK) of the realistic ECG morphology. The EPK is used to adaptively constrain the morphology of the generated ECGs through a dynamic cross-attention (DCA) mechanism. Furthermore, we propose an extension of ControlNet to incorporate demographic and drug data, simulating individual drug reactions. We compare DADM with the other eight state-of-the-art ECG generative models on two real-world databases covering 8 types of drug regimens. The results demonstrate that DADM can more accurately simulate drug-induced changes in ECGs, improving the accuracy by at least 5.79% and recall by 8%.</p></details> | Under review |

However, existing methods often overlook the fitting ability of pre-trained policies and struggle to handle the heterogeneous pre-training data, which are crucial for achieving efficient exploration and fast fine-tuning. To address this gap, we propose Exploratory Diffusion Policy (EDP), which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the explored data, both boosting exploration and obtaining an efficient initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, we estimate the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion policy and propose a score intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore unseen states. For fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion policy on downstream tasks, we provide both theoretical analyses and practical algorithms, including an alternating method of Q function optimization and diffusion policy distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EDP in efficient exploration during pre-training and fast adaptation during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the text input allows us to tap into the power of modern-day video diffusion to generate plausible motion samples for the right object category and part. In turn, the input 3D object provides image prompting to personalize the generated video to that very object we wish to articulate. Our method starts with a few-shot finetuning for category-specific motion generation, a key first step to compensate for the lack of articulation awareness by current video diffusion models. For this, we finetune a pre-trained multi-view image generation model for controllable multi-view video generation, using a small collection of video samples obtained for the target object category. This is followed by motion video personalization that is realized by multi-view rendered images of the target 3D object. At last, we transfer the personalized video motion to the target 3D object via differentiable rendering to optimize part motion parameters by a score distillation sampling loss. We show that our method is capable of generating realistic motion videos and predict 3D motion parameters in a more accurate and generalizable way, compared to prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 16 pages</p></details> |

While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness.

Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency.

However, customization of latent diffusion models using unauthorized data can severely compromise the privacy and intellectual property rights of data owners. Adversarial examples as protective perturbations have been developed to defend against unauthorized data usage by introducing imperceptible noise to customization samples, preventing diffusion models from effectively learning them. In this paper, we first reveal that the primary reason adversarial examples are effective as protective perturbations in latent diffusion models is the distortion of their latent representations, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments. We then propose the Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) utilizing adapters as an adaptive attack against these protection methods, highlighting their lack of robustness.

| **[Improve the Training Efficiency of DRL for Wireless Communication Resource Allocation: The Role of Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07211v1)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.07211v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic resource allocation in mobile wireless networks involves complex, time-varying optimization problems, motivating the adoption of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, most existing works rely on pre-trained policies, overlooking dynamic environmental changes that rapidly invalidate the policies. Periodic retraining becomes inevitable but incurs prohibitive computational costs and energy consumption-critical concerns for resource-constrained wireless systems. We identify three root causes of inefficient retraining: high-dimensional state spaces, suboptimal action spaces exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and reward design limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (D2RL), which leverages generative diffusion models (GDMs) to holistically enhance all three DRL components. Iterative refinement process and distribution modelling of GDMs enable (1) the generation of diverse state samples to improve environmental understanding, (2) balanced action space exploration to escape local optima, and (3) the design of discriminative reward functions that better evaluate action quality. Our framework operates in two modes: Mode I leverages GDMs to explore reward spaces and design discriminative reward functions that rigorously evaluate action quality, while Mode II synthesizes diverse state samples to enhance environmental understanding and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2RL achieves faster convergence and reduced computational costs over conventional DRL methods for resource allocation in wireless communications while maintaining competitive policy performance. This work underscores the transformative potential of GDMs in overcoming fundamental DRL training bottlenecks for wireless networks, paving the way for practical, real-time deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with additional test-time computation (TTC), standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for TTC scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as TTC increases.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Conventional LIC suffers from severe artifacts due to heavy quantization, while generative VQ modeling gives poor fidelity due to the mismatch between learned generative priors and specific inputs. In this work, we propose Hybrid-Diffusion Image Compression (HDCompression), a dual-stream framework that utilizes both generative VQ-modeling and diffusion models, as well as conventional LIC, to achieve both high fidelity and high perceptual quality. Different from previous hybrid methods that directly use pre-trained LIC models to generate low-quality fidelity-preserving information from heavily quantized latent, we use diffusion models to extract high-quality complimentary fidelity information from the ground-truth input, which can enhance the system performance in several aspects: improving indices map prediction, enhancing the fidelity-preserving output of the LIC stream, and refining conditioned image reconstruction with VQ-latent correction. In addition, our diffusion model is based on a dense representative vector (DRV), which is lightweight with very simple sampling schedulers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HDCompression outperforms the previous conventional LIC, generative VQ-modeling, and hybrid frameworks in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualization, providing balanced robust compression performance at ultra-low bitrates.</p></details> | Under Review |

Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "concept unlearning" with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4 and Stable Diffusion v2.1. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Conveniently, the concepts can be defined as either text queries, e.g., "a dog" and "a turtle," or inspirational images, and the local regions can be selected as any number of vertices on the mesh. We can effectively control the influence of the concepts and mix them together using a novel score distillation approach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD operates on each attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model as it extracts and injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising pipeline from which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the expression of these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest (ROI) map on the surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks that we use to control the expression of these activations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BSD empirically and show that it can deform various meshes towards multiple objectives.

Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone. By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse domains.</p></details> | 31 pages 4 figures |

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speedups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, $\textit{Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff)}$, is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide up to 7.2x speedups over standard generation processes and up to 1.75x speedups over existing speculative decoding approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. The synthetic images are validated by expert clinicians for alignment with their corresponding text prompts. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the synthetic images against the real images confirms that our model synthesizes novel images and, crucially, may preserve patient privacy. Finally, classifiers trained on a mixture of synthetic and real data achieve similar performance to those trained on twice the amount of real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential for generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |

This success has sparked interest in leveraging their representations for visual understanding tasks. While recent works have explored this potential for image generation, the visual understanding capabilities of video diffusion models remain largely uncharted. To address this gap, we systematically compare the same model architecture trained for video versus image generation, analyzing the performance of their latent representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, action recognition, depth estimation, and tracking. Results show that video diffusion models consistently outperform their image counterparts, though we find a striking range in the extent of this superiority. We further analyze features extracted from different layers and with varying noise levels, as well as the effect of model size and training budget on representation and generation quality. This work marks the first direct comparison of video and image diffusion objectives for visual understanding, offering insights into the role of temporal information in representation learning.</p></details> |  |

In such a model (e.g., a VAE, GAN, or continuous-time flow-based model), sampling of the target variable $\mathbf{x} \sim p_\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is straightforward, but sampling from a posterior distribution of the form $p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{y}) \propto p_\theta(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$, where $r$ is a constraint function depending on an auxiliary variable $\mathbf{y}$, is generally intractable. We propose to amortize the cost of sampling from such posterior distributions with diffusion models that sample a distribution in the noise space ($\mathbf{z}$). These diffusion samplers are trained by reinforcement learning algorithms to enforce that the transformed samples $f_\theta(\mathbf{z})$ are distributed according to the posterior in the data space ($\mathbf{x}$). For many models and constraints of interest, the posterior in the noise space is smoother than the posterior in the data space, making it more amenable to such amortized inference. Our method enables conditional sampling under unconditional GAN, (H)VAE, and flow-based priors, comparing favorably both with current amortized and non-amortized inference methods. We demonstrate the proposed outsourced diffusion sampling in several experiments with large pretrained prior models: conditional image generation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and protein structure generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms.

However, while empirically effective, the resulting solutions lack generalisation guarantees to certify their accuracy - which may be required for ethical or legal reasons prior to deployment in high-importance applications. In this paper we develop a novel transfer learning approach that is designed to facilitate non-vacuous learning theoretic generalisation guarantees for downstream tasks, even in the low-shot regime. Specifically, we first use upstream tasks to train a distribution over PEFT parameters. We then learn the downstream task by a sample-and-evaluate procedure -- sampling plausible PEFTs from the trained diffusion model and selecting the one with the highest likelihood on the downstream data. Crucially, this confines our model hypothesis to a finite set of PEFT samples. In contrast to learning in the typical continuous hypothesis spaces of neural network weights, this facilitates tighter risk certificates. We instantiate our bound and show non-trivial generalization guarantees compared to existing learning approaches which lead to vacuous bounds in the low-shot regime.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods employ diffusion models conditioned on human templates like depth or normal maps, they often struggle to preserve appearance information due to the discrepancy between sparse driving signals and the actual human subject, resulting in multi-view and temporal inconsistencies. Our approach bridges this gap by combining the reconstruction power of regression-based 3D human reconstruction with the generative capabilities of a diffusion model. The dense driving signal from the initial reconstructed human provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that enables the generalization learned from novel pose synthesis on in-the-wild videos to naturally transfer to novel view synthesis. Our video-based diffusion model enhances disentangled synthesis with high-quality view-consistent renderings for novel views and realistic non-rigid deformations in novel pose animation. Results demonstrate the superior generalization ability of our method across in-domain and out-of-domain in-the-wild datasets. Project page: https://humansensinglab.github.io/GAS/</p></details> |  |

A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a plug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation. Code: https://github.com/TitorX/GVCFDiffusion</p></details> |  |

Several layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a wide range of layouts, such as segmentation maps, edges, and human keypoints. In this work, we propose ObjectDiffusion, a model that conditions T2I diffusion models on semantic and spatial grounding information, enabling the precise rendering and placement of desired objects in specific locations defined by bounding boxes. To achieve this, we make substantial modifications to the network architecture introduced in ControlNet to integrate it with the grounding method proposed in GLIGEN. We fine-tune ObjectDiffusion on the COCO2017 training dataset and evaluate it on the COCO2017 validation dataset. Our model improves the precision and quality of controllable image generation, achieving an AP$_{\text{50}}$ of 46.6, an AR of 44.5, and an FID of 19.8, outperforming the current SOTA model trained on open-source datasets across all three metrics. ObjectDiffusion demonstrates a distinctive capability in synthesizing diverse, high-quality, high-fidelity images that seamlessly conform to the semantic and spatial control layout. Evaluated in qualitative and quantitative tests, ObjectDiffusion exhibits remarkable grounding capabilities in closed-set and open-set vocabulary settings across a wide variety of contexts. The qualitative assessment verifies the ability of ObjectDiffusion to generate multiple detailed objects in varying sizes, forms, and locations.</p></details> |  |

Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.</p></details> |  |

It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</p></details> |  |

While Gaussian-based models succeed within a unified SDE framework, recent studies suggest that heavy-tailed noise distributions, like $\alpha$-stable distributions, may better handle mode collapse and effectively manage datasets exhibiting class imbalance, heavy tails, or prominent outliers. Recently, Yoon et al.\ (NeurIPS 2023), presented the L\'evy-It\^o model (LIM), directly extending the SDE-based framework to a class of heavy-tailed SDEs, where the injected noise followed an $\alpha$-stable distribution, a rich class of heavy-tailed distributions. However, the LIM framework relies on highly involved mathematical techniques with limited flexibility, potentially hindering broader adoption and further development. In this study, instead of starting from the SDE formulation, we extend the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) by replacing the Gaussian noise with $\alpha$-stable noise. By using only elementary proof techniques, the proposed approach, Denoising L\'evy Probabilistic Models (DLPM), boils down to vanilla DDPM with minor modifications. As opposed to the Gaussian case, DLPM and LIM yield different training algorithms and different backward processes, leading to distinct sampling algorithms. These fundamental differences translate favorably for DLPM as compared to LIM: our experiments show improvements in coverage of data distribution tails, better robustness to unbalanced datasets, and improved computation times requiring smaller number of backward steps.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) and VARs (e.g., Infinity) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we explore safety fine-tuning of the text encoder underlying major DM architectures using a customized dataset. Thereby, we suppress NSFW generation while preserving overall image and text generation quality. Finally, to advance research in this area, we introduce ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images.

To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |

However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.</p></details> |  |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, the slow inference speeds limit their potential for broader real-world applications. Here, we introduce Habi, a general framework that transforms powerful but slow diffusion planning models into fast decision-making models, which mimics the cognitive process in the brain that costly goal-directed behavior gradually transitions to efficient habitual behavior with repetitive practice. Even using a laptop CPU, the habitized model can achieve an average 800+ Hz decision-making frequency (faster than previous diffusion planners by orders of magnitude) on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks D4RL, while maintaining comparable or even higher performance compared to its corresponding diffusion planner. Our work proposes a fresh perspective of leveraging powerful diffusion models for real-world decision-making tasks. We also provide robust evaluations and analysis, offering insights from both biological and engineering perspectives for efficient and effective decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Existing text or image-guided generation methods fail to handle the richness and complexity of diverse styles. We present TANGLED, a novel approach for 3D hair strand generation that accommodates diverse image inputs across styles, viewpoints, and quantities of input views. TANGLED employs a three-step pipeline. First, our MultiHair Dataset provides 457 diverse hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes, emphasizing complex and culturally significant styles to improve model generalization. Second, we propose a diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts that can capture topological cues (e.g., strand density and parting lines) while filtering out noise. By leveraging a latent diffusion model with cross-attention on lineart features, our method achieves flexible and robust 3D hair generation across diverse input conditions. Third, a parametric post-processing module enforces braid-specific constraints to maintain coherence in complex structures. This framework not only advances hairstyle realism and diversity but also enables culturally inclusive digital avatars and novel applications like sketch-based 3D strand editing for animation and augmented reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/tangled1</p></details> |

Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods adopt learning-based approaches to implicitly capture priors, but the priors primarily fit in-domain data and do not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a zero-shot depth completion method composed of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment. We use pre-trained depth diffusion models as depth prior knowledge, which implicitly understand how to fill in depth for scenes. Our approach aligns the affine-invariant depth prior with metric-scale sparse measurements, enforcing them as hard constraints via an optimization loop at test-time. Our zero-shot depth completion method demonstrates generalization across various domain datasets, achieving up to a 21\% average performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods while enhancing spatial understanding by sharpening scene details. We demonstrate that aligning a monocular affine-invariant depth prior with sparse metric measurements is a proven strategy to achieve domain-generalizable depth completion without relying on extensive training data.

Generative models that handle multiple distortions frequently struggle with phone reconstruction and high-frequency harmonics, leading to breathing and gasping artifacts that reduce the intelligibility of reconstructed speech. These models are also computationally demanding, and many solutions are restricted to producing outputs in the wide-band frequency range, which limits their suitability for professional applications. To address these challenges, we propose Hi-ResLDM, a novel generative model based on latent diffusion designed to remove multiple distortions and restore speech recordings to studio quality, sampled at 48kHz. We benchmark Hi-ResLDM against state-of-the-art methods that leverage GAN and Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) components, demonstrating superior performance in regenerating high-frequency-band details. Hi-ResLDM not only excels in non-instrusive metrics but is also consistently preferred in human evaluation and performs competitively on intrusive evaluations, making it ideal for high-resolution speech restoration.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches for memory mitigation either only focused on the text modality problem in cross-modal generation tasks or utilized data augmentation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. To facilitate forgetting of stored information in diffusion model parameters, we propose an iterative ensemble training strategy by splitting the data into multiple shards for training multiple models and intermittently aggregating these model parameters. Moreover, practical analysis of losses illustrates that the training loss for easily memorable images tends to be obviously lower. Thus, we propose an anti-gradient control method to exclude the sample with a lower loss value from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, and results show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while even improving the performance slightly. Moreover, to save the computing cost, we successfully apply our method to fine-tune the well-trained diffusion models by limited epochs, demonstrating the applicability of our method.

To address this limitation, we introduce Animate Anyone 2, aiming to animate characters with environment affordance. Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection.

However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines.

These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, existing preference datasets often exhibit overlap between these distributions, leading to a conflict distribution. Additionally, we identified that input prompts contain irrelevant information for less preferred images, limiting the denoising network's ability to accurately predict noise in preference optimization methods, known as the irrelevant prompt issue. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a novel approach that utilizes two distinct captions to mitigate irrelevant prompts. To tackle conflict distribution, we introduce the Pick-Double Caption dataset, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for preferred and less preferred images. We further propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</p></details> |  |

However, AR models are inherently incapable of masked infilling, which is the ability to predict masked tokens between past and future context. In contrast, MLM models suffer from intrinsic computational inefficiencies during both training and inference that hinder their scalability. This work introduces MARIA (Masked and Autoregressive Infilling Architecture), a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art masked infilling performance. MARIA combines a pre-trained MLM and AR model by training a linear decoder that takes their concatenated hidden states as input. This minimal modification enables the AR model to perform infilling while retaining its inherent advantages in terms of faster inference with KV caching. Our results demonstrate that MARIA significantly outperforms existing methods, namely discrete diffusion models, on masked infilling tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we extend diffusion models to handle inverse problems where the observations follow a distribution from the exponential family, such as a Poisson or a Binomial distribution. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of exponential family distributions, we introduce the evidence trick, a method that provides a tractable approximation to the likelihood score. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methodology effectively performs Bayesian inference on spatially inhomogeneous Poisson processes with intensities as intricate as ImageNet images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the real-world impact of our methodology by showing that it performs competitively with the current state-of-the-art in predicting malaria prevalence estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, diffusion models still face challenges in controlling specific attributes and preserving the consistency of other unchanged attributes especially the identity characteristics. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion (SD) models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involves the combinations of target background, identity and face attributes aimed to edit. We strive to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable consistency of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Attribute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) A high-consistency FaceFusion method that transfers identity features from the Identity Encoder to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained SD model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.

Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. Here, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We use the forward process of the diffusion model to add additional auxiliary observations and then perform an SMC sampling as part of the backward process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of our approach over competing methods on various inverse problem tasks.</p></details> |  |

Expert evaluation confirms that the generated drawings meet publication standards while significantly reducing processing time from hours to seconds per drawing. The model can be fine-tuned to adapt to different archaeological contexts with minimal training data, making it versatile across various pottery documentation styles. The pre-trained models, the Python library and comprehensive documentation are provided to facilitate adoption within the archaeological research community.</p></details> |  |

Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

This reliance on synthetic data can also be intentional, as seen in Rectified Flow models, whose Reflow method iteratively uses self-generated data to straighten the flow and improve sampling efficiency. However, recent studies have shown that repeatedly training on self-generated samples can lead to model collapse (MC), where performance degrades over time. Despite this, most recent work on MC either focuses on empirical observations or analyzes regression problems and maximum likelihood objectives, leaving a rigorous theoretical analysis of reflow methods unexplored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing both theoretical analysis and practical solutions for addressing MC in diffusion/flow models. We begin by studying Denoising Autoencoders and prove performance degradation when DAEs are iteratively trained on their own outputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to rigorously analyze model collapse in DAEs and, by extension, in diffusion models and Rectified Flow. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that rectified flow also suffers from MC, leading to potential performance degradation in each reflow step. Additionally, we prove that incorporating real data can prevent MC during recursive DAE training, supporting the recent trend of using real data as an effective approach for mitigating MC. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Real-data Augmented Reflow and a series of improved variants, which seamlessly integrate real data into Reflow training by leveraging reverse flow. Empirical evaluations on standard image benchmarks confirm that RA Reflow effectively mitigates model collapse, preserving high-quality sample generation even with fewer sampling steps.</p></details> |  |

However, recent findings suggest that image likelihood does not align with perceptual quality: high-likelihood samples tend to be smooth, while lower-likelihood ones are more detailed. Controlling sample density is thus crucial for balancing realism and detail. In this paper, we analyze an existing technique, Prior Guidance, which scales the latent code to influence image detail. We introduce score alignment, a condition that explains why this method works and show that it can be tractably checked for any continuous normalizing flow model. We then propose Density Guidance, a principled modification of the generative ODE that enables exact log-density control during sampling. Finally, we extend Density Guidance to stochastic sampling, ensuring precise log-density control while allowing controlled variation in structure or fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that these techniques provide fine-grained control over image detail without compromising sample quality.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |

Our analysis explains the unimodal representation dynamics across noise scales, mainly driven by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Building on these insights, we propose an ensemble method that aggregates features across noise levels, significantly improving both clean performance and robustness under label noise.

Among these, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been employed as key generative image completion approaches, excelling in the field of generating high-quality restorations with reduced artifacts and improved fine details. In previous work, we developed a method aimed at synthesizing views from novel microscope positions for mastoidectomy surgeries; however, that approach did not have the ability to restore the surrounding surgical scene environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to complete the surgical scene of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning on real surgical datasets to train a Single-Step Denoising Diffusion-GAN (SSDD-GAN), combining the advantages of diffusion models with the adversarial optimization of GANs for improved Structural Similarity results of 6%. The trained model is then directly applied to the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset using a zero-shot approach, enabling the generation of realistic and complete surgical scenes without the need for explicit ground-truth labels from the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. This method addresses key limitations in previous work, offering a novel pathway for full surgical microscopy scene completion and enhancing the usability of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset in surgical preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation.</p></details> |  |

This task is difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation. Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models offer new possibilities for augmenting classification datasets. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on Text2Image generation or Img2Img methods, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and recent generative data augmentation methods. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training, contextual bias, and few-shot classification. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional constant bitrate streaming (CBS) and adaptive bitrate streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While it keeps B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to ensure efficient video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework is complemented with the most state-of-the-art denoising and video frame interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency.

However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Notably, the one-step distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves an FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, a record low value under the data-free setting.

Although Bayesian filtering has been the cornerstone solution, its classical model-based paradigm faces two major limitations: it struggles with inaccurate state space model (SSM) and requires extensive prior knowledge of noise characteristics. We present TrackDiffuser, a generative framework addressing both challenges by reformulating Bayesian filtering as a conditional diffusion model. Our approach implicitly learns system dynamics from data to mitigate the effects of inaccurate SSM, while simultaneously circumventing the need for explicit measurement models and noise priors by establishing a direct relationship between measurements and states. Through an implicit predict-and-update mechanism, TrackDiffuser preserves the interpretability advantage of traditional model-based filtering methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms both classical and contemporary hybrid methods, especially in challenging non-linear scenarios involving non-Gaussian noises. Notably, TrackDiffuser exhibits remarkable robustness to SSM inaccuracies, offering a practical solution for real-world state estimation problems where perfect models and prior knowledge are unavailable.</p></details> |  |

However, their current utility in these fields is severely limited by an inability to enforce strict adherence to physical laws and domain-specific constraints. Without this grounding, the deployment of such models in critical applications, ranging from material science to safety-critical systems, remains impractical. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing a novel approach to integrate stable diffusion models with constrained optimization frameworks, enabling them to generate outputs that satisfy stringent physical and functional requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through material science experiments requiring adherence to precise morphometric properties, inverse design problems involving the generation of stress-strain responses using video generation with a simulator in the loop, and safety settings where outputs must avoid copyright infringement.</p></details> |  |

Typically, sampling from a diffusion model involves using a denoising distribution characterized by a Gaussian with a learned mean and either fixed or learned covariances. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed covariance moment matching technique and introduce a novel method for learning the diagonal covariance. Unlike traditional data-driven diagonal covariance approximation approaches, our method involves directly regressing the optimal diagonal analytic covariance using a new, unbiased objective named Optimal Covariance Matching (OCM). This approach can significantly reduce the approximation error in covariance prediction. We demonstrate how our method can substantially enhance the sampling efficiency, recall rate and likelihood of commonly used diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods utilize attention mechanisms to generate interest representations by aggregating historical item embeddings. However, these methods only capture overall item-level relevance, leading to coarse-grained interest representations that include irrelevant information. To address this issue, we propose the Diffusion Multi-Interest model (DMI), a novel framework for refining user interest representations at the dimension level. Specifically, DMI first introduces controllable noise into coarse-grained interest representations at the dimensional level. Then, in the iterative reconstruction process, DMI combines a cross-attention mechanism and an item pruning strategy to reconstruct the personalized interest vectors with the guidance of tailored collaborative information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DMI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test. Successfully deployed in the real-world recommender system, DMI effectively enhances user satisfaction and system performance at scale, serving the major traffic of hundreds of millions of daily active users. \footnote{The code will be released for reproducibility once the paper is accepted.}</p></details> |  |

AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

A proposed remedy is to train exclusively on noisy data with potential copyright issues, ensuring the model never observes original content. However, through the lens of deconvolution theory, we show that although it is theoretically feasible to learn the data distribution from noisy samples, the practical challenge of collecting sufficient samples makes successful learning nearly unattainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose to pretrain the model with a small fraction of clean data to guide the deconvolution process. Combined with our Stochastic Forward--Backward Deconvolution (SFBD) method, we attain an FID of $6.31$ on CIFAR-10 with just $4\%$ clean images (and $3.58$ with $10\%$). Theoretically, we prove that SFBD guides the model to learn the true data distribution. The result also highlights the importance of pretraining on limited but clean data or the alternative from similar datasets. Empirical studies further support these findings and offer additional insights.</p></details> |  |

Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

Current un-/weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks trained only on healthy data; however GAN-based networks are more challenging to train due to issues with simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, etc. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised Implicitly guided COuNterfactual diffusion model for Detecting Anomalies in PET images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases containing both local and public datasets. The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUVmax thresholding.

The inference of Show-o involves progressively denoising image tokens and autoregressively decoding text tokens, and hence, unfortunately, suffers from inefficiency issues from both sides. This paper introduces Show-o Turbo to bridge the gap. We first identify a unified denoising perspective for the generation of images and text in Show-o based on the parallel decoding of text tokens. We then propose to extend consistency distillation (CD), a qualified approach for shortening the denoising process of diffusion models, to the multimodal denoising trajectories of Show-o. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy and a curriculum learning procedure to improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, Show-o Turbo displays a GenEval score of 0.625 at 4 sampling steps without using classifier-free guidance (CFG), outperforming that of the original Show-o with 8 steps and CFG; in image-to-text generation, Show-o Turbo exhibits a 1.5x speedup without significantly sacrificing performance.

However, recent Consistency Models (CMs), which offer fewer function evaluations, rely on distilling CFG knowledge from pretrained DMs to achieve guidance, making them costly and inflexible. In this work, we propose invertible Guided Consistency Training (iGCT), a novel training framework for guided CMs that is entirely data-driven. iGCT, as a pioneering work, contributes to fast and guided image generation and editing without requiring the training and distillation of DMs, greatly reducing the overall compute requirements. iGCT addresses the saturation artifacts seen in CFG under high guidance scales. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet64 show that iGCT significantly improves FID and precision compared to CFG. At a guidance of 13, iGCT improves precision to 0.8, while DM's drops to 0.47. Our work takes the first step toward enabling guidance and inversion for CMs without relying on DMs.</p></details> |  |

ImmerseDiffusion is trained to generate first-order ambisonics (FOA) audio, which is a conventional spatial audio format comprising four channels that can be rendered to multichannel spatial output. The proposed generative system is composed of a spatial audio codec that maps FOA audio to latent components, a latent diffusion model trained based on various user input types, namely, text prompts, spatial, temporal and environmental acoustic parameters, and optionally a spatial audio and text encoder trained in a Contrastive Language and Audio Pretraining (CLAP) style. We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the generated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of generation quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes: ``descriptive", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric", which uses non-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate promising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect reliable spatial fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2025</p></details> |

High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output before committing to full resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability .</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and Weight: https://github.com/FoundationVision/FlashVideo</p></details> |

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce Hummingbird, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets. Benchmark experiments show Hummingbird outperforms all existing methods by achieving superior fidelity while maintaining diversity, validating Hummingbird's potential as a robust multimodal context-aligned image generator in complex visual tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIFS</p></details> |

We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP. We release our implementations and pre-trained models at this MGPATH.</p></details> | first version |

Yet, aligning these models with user's intentions still involves a laborious trial-and-error process, and this challenging alignment problem has attracted considerable attention from the research community. In this work, instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models, we use Mutual Information (MI) to guide model alignment. In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.

Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps \cite{vlmaps} on the complex R2R-Habitat \cite{r2r} instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

This integration has significantly enhanced performance across a diverse spectrum of applications, such as scene perception and robotics. However, the deployment of VLMs has also given rise to critical safety and security concerns, necessitating extensive research to assess the potential vulnerabilities these VLM systems may harbor. In this work, we present an in-depth survey of the attack strategies tailored for VLMs. We categorize these attacks based on their underlying objectives - namely jailbreak, camouflage, and exploitation - while also detailing the various methodologies employed for data manipulation of VLMs. Meanwhile, we outline corresponding defense mechanisms that have been proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities. By discerning key connections and distinctions among the diverse types of attacks, we propose a compelling taxonomy for VLM attacks. Moreover, we summarize the evaluation metrics that comprehensively describe the characteristics and impact of different attacks on VLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of promising future research directions that could further enhance the robustness and safety of VLMs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing exploration in this critical area of study.

In this work, we discovered that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. We rebalanced the computational loads from data, model, and memory perspectives to address this issue, achieving more balanced computation across devices. These three components are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Specifically, for the data, we grouped instances into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. For the model, we employed a search-based method to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjusted the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, we significantly reduced GPU days, achieving about 1.8x speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability were further demonstrated across various models and datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/OmniBal.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

| **[From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01828v2)** | 2025-02-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.01828v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

This study investigated simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

This work introduces a novel, cognitively-inspired evaluation framework to systematically analyze VLM reasoning on natural image-based Bongard Problems. We propose three structured paradigms -- Direct Visual Rule Learning, Deductive Rule Learning, and Componential Analysis -- designed to progressively enforce step-wise reasoning and disentangle the interplay between perception and reasoning. Our evaluation shows that advanced, closed-source VLMs (GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0) achieve near-superhuman performance, particularly when provided with high-quality image descriptions, while open-source models exhibit a significant performance bottleneck due to deficiencies in perception. An ablation study further confirms that perception, rather than reasoning, is the primary limiting factor, as open-source models apply extracted rules effectively when given accurate descriptions. These findings underscore the critical role of robust multimodal perception in enhancing generalizable visual reasoning and highlight the importance of structured, step-wise reasoning paradigms for advancing machine intelligence.</p></details> |  |

We additionally use these output probabilities to spatially localize real objects. Building on this approach, we introduce a knowledge erasure algorithm that removes hallucinations by linearly orthogonalizing image features with respect to hallucinated object features. We show that targeted edits to a model's latent representations can reduce hallucinations by up to 25.7% on the COCO2014 dataset while preserving performance.

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to produce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs, efforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain and to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM training. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM specifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE models, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel Instruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts tailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects of the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on a specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy of the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by facilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a two-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance degradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset using our proposed training strategy. Experimental results on the RSICap dataset, along with evaluations on other traditional datasets where no additional fine-tuning was applied, demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating precise and contextually relevant captions. Notably, our RS-MoE-1B variant achieves performance comparable to 13B VLMs, demonstrating the efficiency of our model design. Moreover, our model demonstrates promising generalization capabilities by consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) task.</p></details> |  |

We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

However, assessing their safety and effectiveness remains challenging because it is difficult to test all the different ways a single task can be phrased. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models fail or behave unsafely on ERT-generated instructions, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data. Our code is made available on GitHub at the address https://github.com/tbary/CP4VLM.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184v2)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.19184v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting systems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles $\unicode{x2013}$ directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions. To support further research, we use public datasets and will release our code and preprocessing pipeline, providing a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 Workshop on Emergent Visual Abilities and Limits of Foundation Models</p></details> |

These agents aim to execute human instructions on smartphones by interpreting textual instructions and performing actions via the device's interface. While promising, current approaches face significant limitations. Methods that use large proprietary models, such as GPT-4o, are computationally expensive, while those that use smaller fine-tuned models often lack adaptability to out-of-distribution tasks. In this work, we introduce AppVLM, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM). First, we fine-tune it offline on the AndroidControl dataset. Then, we refine its policy by collecting data from the AndroidWorld environment and performing further training iterations. Our results indicate that AppVLM achieves the highest action prediction accuracy in offline evaluation on the AndroidControl dataset, compared to all evaluated baselines, and matches GPT-4o in online task completion success rate in the AndroidWorld environment, while being up to ten times faster. This makes AppVLM a practical and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

We model the prediction process using a Structural Causal Model (SCM) and show that the causal mechanism involving both invariant and variant factors in training environments differs from that in test environments. In contrast, the causal mechanism with solely invariant factors remains consistent across environments. We theoretically prove the existence of a linear mapping from CLIP embeddings to invariant factors, which can be estimated using interventional data. Additionally, we provide a condition to guarantee low OOD risk of the invariant predictor. Based on these insights, we propose the Invariant Causal Mechanism of CLIP (CLIP-ICM) framework. CLIP-ICM involves collecting interventional data, estimating a linear projection matrix, and making predictions within the invariant subspace. Experiments on several OOD datasets show that CLIP-ICM significantly improves the performance of CLIP. Our method offers a simple but powerful enhancement, boosting the reliability of CLIP in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</p></details> |  |

While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation.

Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in the medical field due to their ability to leverage both visual and linguistic contexts, reducing the need for large datasets and enabling the performance of complex tasks. However, the exploration of fairness within VLM applications remains limited. Applying VLMs without a comprehensive analysis of fairness could lead to concerns about equal treatment opportunities and diminish public trust in medical deep learning models. To build trust in medical VLMs, we propose Fair-MoE, a model specifically designed to ensure both fairness and effectiveness. Fair-MoE comprises two key components: \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Mixture of Experts (FO-MoE)} and \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Loss (FOL)}. FO-MoE is designed to leverage the expertise of various specialists to filter out biased patch embeddings and use an ensemble approach to extract more equitable information relevant to specific tasks. FOL is a novel fairness-oriented loss function that not only minimizes the distances between different attributes but also optimizes the differences in the dispersion of various attributes' distributions. Extended experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and fairness of Fair-MoE. Tested on the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset, Fair-MoE showed improvements in both fairness and accuracy across all four attributes. Code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

The conventional modus operandi for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time primarily focuses on tuning learnable prompts; however, this approach overlooks potential distribution shifts in the visual representations themselves. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing Test-Time Noise Tuning (TNT), a novel method for handling unpredictable shifts in the visual space. TNT leverages, for the first time, a noise adaptation strategy that optimizes learnable noise directly in the visual input space, enabling adaptive feature learning from a single test sample. We further introduce a novel approach for inter-view representation alignment by explicitly enforcing coherence in embedding distances, ensuring consistent feature representations across views. Combined with scaled logits and confident view selection at inference, TNT substantially enhances VLM generalization and calibration, achieving average gains of +7.38% on natural distributions benchmark and +0.80% on cross-dataset evaluations over zero-shot CLIP. These improvements lay a strong foundation for adaptive out-of-distribution handling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Razaimam45/TNT</p></details> |

Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at https://github.com/rabiulcste/vqazero</p></details> |

Recently, inspired by Vision-Language Models, Graph Neutral Networks (GNNs) have been introduced as an additional modality into the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their performance on Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) tasks. However, those GNN-enhanced LLMs have the following limitations: (1) They employ diverse GNNs to model varying types of structured data, rendering them unable to uniformly process various forms of structured data. (2) The pretraining of GNNs is coupled with specific LLMs, which prevents GNNs from fully aligning with the textual space and limits their adaptability to other LLMs. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage and \textbf{S}tructured Data \textbf{A}ssistant (LLaSA), a general framework for enhancing LLMs' ability to handle structured data. Specifically, we represent various types of structured data in a unified hypergraph format, and use self-supervised learning to pretrain a hypergraph encoder, and a G-Former compressing encoded hypergraph representations with cross-attention. The compressed hypergraph representations are appended to the serialized inputs during training and inference stages of LLMs. Experimental results on multiple SKG tasks show that our pretrained hypergraph encoder can adapt to various LLMs and enhance their ability to process different types of structured data.

We introduce the STEM Education Retrieval Dataset (SER), which contains over 24,000 query pairs of different styles, and the Uni-Retrieval, an efficient and style-diversified retrieval vision-language model based on prompt tuning. Uni-Retrieval extracts query style features as prototypes and builds a continuously updated Prompt Bank containing prompt tokens for diverse queries.

Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose SIMA, a self-improvement framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment without external dependencies. SIMA leverages existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses, incorporating an in-context self-critic mechanism that constructs preference pairs for tuning. Crucially, our approach allows LVLMs to act as critics by designing effective critic prompts, eliminating the need for additional fine-tuning with external instruction data. We introduce three novel visual metrics within the self-critic process to guide judgment, significantly improving the accuracy of self-critic. Through extensive experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA significantly improves LVLM's performance and outperforms previous approaches, achieving superior modality alignment.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) helps assess prediction confidence and enables abstention when uncertainty is high. Conformal prediction (CP), a leading UQ method, provides statistical guarantees but relies on static thresholds, which fail to adapt to task complexity and evolving data distributions, leading to suboptimal trade-offs in accuracy, coverage, and informativeness. To address this, we propose learnable conformal abstention, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with CP to optimize abstention thresholds dynamically. By treating CP thresholds as adaptive actions, our approach balances multiple objectives, minimizing prediction set size while maintaining reliable coverage. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLM/VLM benchmarks show our method outperforms Least Ambiguous Classifiers (LAC) and Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS), improving accuracy by up to 3.2%, boosting AUROC for hallucination detection by 22.19%, enhancing uncertainty-guided selective generation (AUARC) by 21.17%, and reducing calibration error by 70%-85%. These improvements hold across multiple models and datasets while consistently meeting the 90% coverage target, establishing our approach as a more effective and flexible solution for reliable decision-making in safety-critical applications.

Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Furthermore, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide), aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.

Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</p></details> |  |

However, to further enhance their capabilities of empathetic and effective communication with humans, improving how VLMs process and understand emotions is crucial. Despite significant research attention on improving affective understanding, there is a lack of detailed evaluations of VLMs for emotion-related tasks, which can potentially help inform downstream fine-tuning efforts. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLMs for recognizing evoked emotions from images. We create a benchmark for the task of evoked emotion recognition and study the performance of VLMs for this task, from perspectives of correctness and robustness. Through several experiments, we demonstrate important factors that emotion recognition performance depends on, and also characterize the various errors made by VLMs in the process. Finally, we pinpoint potential causes for errors through a human evaluation study. We use our experimental results to inform recommendations for the future of emotion research in the context of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+ references and appendix)</p></details> |

While Vision-Language Models analyze facial expressions from images, they are resource-intensive and may depend more on linguistic priors than visual understanding. To address this, this study investigates whether LLMs can infer affective meaning from dimensions of facial expressions-Valence and Arousal values, structured numerical representations, rather than using raw visual input. VA values were extracted using Facechannel from images of facial expressions and provided to LLMs in two tasks: (1) categorizing facial expressions into basic (on the IIMI dataset) and complex emotions (on the Emotic dataset) and (2) generating semantic descriptions of facial expressions (on the Emotic dataset). Results from the categorization task indicate that LLMs struggle to classify VA values into discrete emotion categories, particularly for emotions beyond basic polarities (e.g., happiness, sadness). However, in the semantic description task, LLMs produced textual descriptions that align closely with human-generated interpretations, demonstrating a stronger capacity for free text affective inference of facial expressions.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate this gap, we extend the textual cognitive reframing to multimodality, incorporating visual clues. Specifically, we present a new dataset called Multi Modal-Cognitive Support Conversation (M2CoSC), which pairs each GPT-4-generated dialogue with an image that reflects the virtual client's facial expressions. To better mirror real psychotherapy, where facial expressions lead to interpreting implicit emotional evidence, we propose a multi-hop psychotherapeutic reasoning approach that explicitly identifies and incorporates subtle evidence. Our comprehensive experiments with both LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate that the VLMs' performance as psychotherapists is significantly improved with the M2CoSC dataset. Furthermore, the multi-hop psychotherapeutic reasoning method enables VLMs to provide more thoughtful and empathetic suggestions, outperforming standard prompting methods.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Main |

This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances).

However, existing studies typically focus on the reasoning based on a single image and heavily depend on text prompting, limiting their ability to learn comprehensive understanding from multiple images. To address this, we propose an effective yet efficient approach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task and introduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking. Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to new instructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-aware attention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additional supervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistently outperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial age estimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarily focuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a natural and generalized way of learning from visual differences across images, bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.

However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SumGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SumGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Renam...</summary><p>Renamed SGD to SumGD in Summary-Guided Decoding to prevent confusion with Stochastic Gradient Descent</p></details> |

For hazard detection, we employ a set of heuristic rules as weak classifiers, which are combined using an ensemble method. This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards.

However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Long-VITA, a simple yet effective large multi-modal model for long-context visual-language understanding tasks. It is adept at concurrently processing and analyzing modalities of image, video, and text over 4K frames or 1M tokens while delivering advanced performances on short-context multi-modal tasks. We propose an effective multi-modal training schema that starts with large language models and proceeds through vision-language alignment, general knowledge learning, and two sequential stages of long-sequence fine-tuning. We further implement context-parallelism distributed inference and logits-masked language modeling head to scale Long-VITA to infinitely long inputs of images and texts during model inference. Regarding training data, Long-VITA is built on a mix of $17$M samples from public datasets only and demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on various multi-modal benchmarks, compared against recent cutting-edge models with internal data.

However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging semantics extracted from vision-language models and geometry guided by LiDAR points, OccGS constructs Semantic and Geometric-Aware Gaussians from raw multisensor data. We also develop a cumulative Gaussian-to-3D voxel splatting method for reconstructing occupancy from the Gaussians. OccGS performs favorably against self-supervised methods in occupancy prediction, achieving comparable performance to fully supervised approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot semantic 3D occupancy estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, VLMs are often limited by their use of pretrained image encoders, like CLIP, leading to image understanding errors that hinder overall performance. On top of that, real-world applications often require the model to be continuously adapted as new and often limited data continuously arrive. To address this, we propose LoRSU (Low-Rank Adaptation with Structured Updates), a robust and computationally efficient method for selectively updating image encoders within VLMs. LoRSU introduces structured and localized parameter updates, effectively correcting performance on previously error-prone data while preserving the model's general robustness. Our approach leverages theoretical insights to identify and update only the most critical parameters, achieving significant resource efficiency. Specifically, we demonstrate that LoRSU reduces computational overhead by over 25x compared to full VLM updates, without sacrificing performance. Experimental results on VQA tasks in the few-shot continual learning setting, validate LoRSU's scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness, making it a compelling solution for image encoder adaptation in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, these models demand extensive resources during inference. Adaptive attention techniques can dynamically reduce computational redundancy and thus improve efficiency. Although current adaptive attention methods significantly reduce the memory requirements of Transformer-based language models, they are not tailored for LVLMs. We observe that LVLMs generate responses from both remote image tokens and local text tokens, and different modalities have different attention patterns. This observation inspires us to manage the attention for each modality separately. Specifically, for visual input, we store the cache of potentially useful information but only compute the most critical parts. For language input, we care more about local information. Based on our observation and analysis of vision-language attention patterns, we develop A-VL, a plug-and-play adaptive attention tailored for LVLM inference. Extensive evaluations on three vision-language tasks and five datasets show the effectiveness of our designs. Our approach A-VL outperforms existing adaptive attention methods in reducing memory usage and computational load without compromising performance.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of such risks in VLMs. In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of misuse and leakage detection in VLMs through the lens of membership inference attack (MIA). In specific, we focus on the instruction tuning data of VLMs, which is more likely to contain sensitive or unauthorized information. To address the limitation of existing MIA methods, we introduce a novel approach that infers membership based on a set of samples and their sensitivity to temperature, a unique parameter in VLMs. Based on this, we propose four membership inference methods, each tailored to different levels of background knowledge, ultimately arriving at the most challenging scenario.

In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1\% in AR and achieving a 21.3\% AP improvement over SAM.

To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field.

However, creating these articulated objects requires extensive human effort and expertise, limiting their broader applications. To overcome this challenge, we present Articulate-Anything, a system that automates the articulation of diverse, complex objects from many input modalities, including text, images, and videos. Articulate-Anything leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that can be compiled into an interactable digital twin for use in standard 3D simulators. Our system exploits existing 3D asset datasets via a mesh retrieval mechanism, along with an actor-critic system that iteratively proposes, evaluates, and refines solutions for articulating the objects, self-correcting errors to achieve a robust outcome. Qualitative evaluations demonstrate Articulate-Anything's capability to articulate complex and even ambiguous object affordances by leveraging rich grounded inputs. In extensive quantitative experiments on the standard PartNet-Mobility dataset, Articulate-Anything substantially outperforms prior work, increasing the success rate from 8.7-11.6% to 75% and setting a new bar for state-of-the-art performance. We further showcase the utility of our system by generating 3D assets from in-the-wild video inputs, which are then used to train robotic policies for fine-grained manipulation tasks in simulation that go beyond basic pick and place. These policies are then transferred to a real robotic system.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In this paper, we show that the common practice of individually exploiting the text or image encoders of these powerful multi-modal models is highly suboptimal for intra-modal tasks like image-to-image retrieval. We argue that this is inherently due to the CLIP-style inter-modal contrastive loss that does not enforce any intra-modal constraints, leading to what we call intra-modal misalignment. To demonstrate this, we leverage two optimization-based modality inversion techniques that map representations from their input modality to the complementary one without any need for auxiliary data or additional trained adapters. We empirically show that, in the intra-modal tasks of image-to-image and text-to-text retrieval, approaching these tasks inter-modally significantly improves performance with respect to intra-modal baselines on more than fifteen datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that approaching a native inter-modal task (e.g. zero-shot image classification) intra-modally decreases performance, further validating our findings. Finally, we show that incorporating an intra-modal term in the pre-training objective or narrowing the modality gap between the text and image feature embedding spaces helps reduce the intra-modal misalignment.

However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.</p></details> |  |

To address this, most existing methods learn a network to prune redundant visual tokens using certain training data. Differently, we propose a text-guided training-free token optimization mechanism dubbed SparseVLM that eliminates the need of extra parameters or fine-tuning costs. Given that visual tokens complement text tokens in VLM's linguistic reasoning, we select relevant text tokens to rate the significance of visual tokens using self-attention matrices and, then, prune visual tokens using the proposed strategy to maximize sparsity while retaining information. In particular, we introduce a rank-based strategy to adaptively determine the sparsification ratio for each layer, alongside a token recycling method that compresses pruned tokens into more compact representations. Experimental results show that SparseVLM increases the efficiency of various VLMs in a number of image and video understanding tasks. For example, LLaVA when equipped with SparseVLM achieves 54% reduction in FLOPs, 37% decrease in CUDA latency while maintaining 97% of its original accuracy.

Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

Since modern retrieval systems mainly rely on the textual information they extract from document pages to index documents -often through lengthy and brittle processes-, they struggle to exploit key visual cues efficiently. This limits their capabilities in many practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieval tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and practical settings. The inherent complexity and performance shortcomings of modern systems motivate a new concept; doing document retrieval by directly embedding the images of the document pages. We release ColPali, a Vision Language Model trained to produce high-quality multi-vector embeddings from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically simpler, faster and end-to-end trainable.

Regression models achieve high pose accuracy but struggle with model-to-image alignment due to the lack of explicit 2D-3D correspondences. In contrast, optimization-based methods align 3D models to 2D observations but are prone to local minima and depth ambiguity. In this work, we leverage large vision-language models (VLMs) to generate interactive body part descriptions, which serve as implicit constraints to enhance 3D perception and limit the optimization space. Specifically, we formulate monocular human mesh recovery as a distribution adaptation task by integrating both 2D observations and language descriptions. To bridge the gap between text and 3D pose signals, we first train a text encoder and a pose VQ-VAE, aligning texts to body poses in a shared latent space using contrastive learning. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion-based framework to refine the initial parameters guided by gradients derived from both 2D observations and text descriptions. Finally, the model can produce poses with accurate 3D perception and image consistency. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate its effectiveness. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose Time-VLM, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately identifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in diagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs' visual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source files--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines, annotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we extracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and transformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and generate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of image-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method demonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate answers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram structures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested .xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source files, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the feasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction from original source files. By enabling robust diagram understanding through LLMs, our method offers a promising path toward enhanced workflow efficiency and information analysis in real-world business scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The related code is available at \url{https://github.com/galirage/spreadsheet-intelligence}, which provides the core library developed for this research.

Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our empirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to serve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we provide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth observation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models.

In this paper, we investigate the internal dynamics of hallucination by examining the tokens logits rankings throughout the generation process, revealing three key patterns in how LVLMs process information: (1) gradual visual information loss -- visually grounded tokens gradually become less favored throughout generation, and (2) early excitation -- semantically meaningful tokens achieve peak activation in the layers earlier than the final layer. (3) hidden genuine information -- visually grounded tokens though not being eventually decided still retain relatively high rankings at inference. Based on these insights, we propose VISTA (Visual Information Steering with Token-logit Augmentation), a training-free inference-time intervention framework that reduces hallucination while promoting genuine information. VISTA works by combining two complementary approaches: reinforcing visual information in activation space and leveraging early layer activations to promote semantically meaningful decoding. Compared to existing methods, VISTA requires no external supervision and is applicable to various decoding strategies. Extensive experiments show that VISTA on average reduces hallucination by abount 40% on evaluated open-ended generation task, and it consistently outperforms existing methods on four benchmarks across four architectures under three decoding strategies.</p></details> |  |

GLOV prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to their fitness for the downstream vision task. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we explicitly guide the LLM's generation at each optimization step by adding an offset vector -- calculated from the embedding differences between previous positive and negative solutions -- to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation. This offset vector biases the LLM generation toward the type of language the downstream VLM prefers, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on two tasks: object recognition and the critical task of enhancing VLM safety. Our GLOV shows performance improvement by up to 15.0% and 57.5% for dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LlaVA) models for object recognition and reduces the attack success rate (ASR) on state-of-the-art VLMs by up to $60.7\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

However, these models are typically trained on web videos, which often fail to capture the challenges present in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. Existing works address ADL-specific challenges, such as similar appearances, subtle motion patterns, and multiple viewpoints, by combining 3D skeletons and RGB videos. However, these approaches are not integrated with language, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen action classes. In this paper, we introduce SKI models, which integrate 3D skeletons into the vision-language embedding space. SKI models leverage a skeleton-language model, SkeletonCLIP, to infuse skeleton information into Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) through collaborative training. Notably, SKI models do not require skeleton data during inference, enhancing their robustness for real-world applications. The effectiveness of SKI models is validated on three popular ADL datasets for zero-shot action recognition and video caption generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 NAACL: Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> |

While existing vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in specific tasks such as report generation or abnormality detection, they often lack support for interactive diagnostic capabilities. In this work we present RadVLM, a compact, multitask conversational foundation model designed for CXR interpretation. To this end, we curate a large-scale instruction dataset comprising over 1 million image-instruction pairs containing both single-turn tasks -- such as report generation, abnormality classification, and visual grounding -- and multi-turn, multi-task conversational interactions. After fine-tuning RadVLM on this instruction dataset, we evaluate it across different tasks along with re-implemented baseline VLMs. Our results show that RadVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in conversational capabilities and visual grounding while remaining competitive in other radiology tasks. Ablation studies further highlight the benefit of joint training across multiple tasks, particularly for scenarios with limited annotated data. Together, these findings highlight the potential of RadVLM as a clinically relevant AI assistant, providing structured CXR interpretation and conversational capabilities to support more effective and accessible diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | 21 pages, 15 figures |

Unlike traditional video analysis tasks, TPAS significantly emphasizes understanding and interpreting the subtle relationships between text descriptions and visual data. The complexity of this task lies in the model's need to not only match individuals to text descriptions in massive image datasets but also accurately differentiate between search results when faced with similar descriptions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Similarity Coverage Analysis (SCA) strategy to address the recognition difficulty caused by similar text descriptions. This strategy effectively enhances the model's capacity to manage subtle differences, thus improving both the accuracy and reliability of the search. Our proposed solution demonstrated excellent performance in this challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 WWW Workshop on MORE</p></details> |

Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. iVISPAR is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle-a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 2D, 3D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while some VLMs perform well on simple spatial tasks, they encounter difficulties with more complex configurations and problem properties. Notably, while VLMs generally perform better in 2D vision compared to 3D or text-based representations, they consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This highlights critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition.</p></details> |  |

However, the safety issues of their integration with a vision module, or vision language models (VLMs), remain relatively underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreaking attack against VLMs, aiming to bypass their safety barrier when a user inputs harmful instructions. A scenario where our poisoned (image, text) data pairs are included in the training data is assumed. By replacing the original textual captions with malicious jailbreak prompts, our method can perform jailbreak attacks with the poisoned images. Moreover, we analyze the effect of poison ratios and positions of trainable parameters on our attack's success rate. For evaluation, we design two metrics to quantify the success rate and the stealthiness of our attack. Together with a list of curated harmful instructions, a benchmark for measuring attack efficacy is provided. We demonstrate the efficacy of our attack by comparing it with baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Name ...</summary><p>Name change: LlamaFusion to LMFusion</p></details> |

Unfortunately, in classification tasks involving non-training classes, known as open-vocabulary setting, fine-tuned VLMs often overfit to train classes, resulting in a misalignment between confidence scores and actual accuracy on unseen classes, which significantly undermines their reliability in real-world deployments. Existing confidence calibration methods typically require training parameters or analyzing features from the training dataset, restricting their ability to generalize unseen classes without corresponding train data. Moreover, VLM-specific calibration methods rely solely on text features from train classes as calibration indicators, which inherently limits their ability to calibrate train classes. To address these challenges, we propose an effective multimodal calibration method Contrast-Aware Calibration (CAC). Building on the original CLIP's zero-shot adaptability and the conclusion from empirical analysis that poor intra-class and inter-class discriminative ability on unseen classes is the root cause, we calculate calibration weights based on the contrastive difference between the original and fine-tuned CLIP. This method not only adapts to calibrating unseen classes but also overcomes the limitations of previous VLM calibration methods that could not calibrate train classes. In experiments involving 11 datasets with 5 fine-tuning methods, CAC consistently achieved the best calibration effect on both train and unseen classes without sacrificing accuracy and inference speed.</p></details> |  |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks. By efficiently transferring the visual expertise of image generators with minimal supervision, Lavender offers a scalable solution for more accurate vision-language systems.

This paper presents VLM Dialog Games, a novel and scalable self-improvement framework for VLMs. Our approach leverages self-play between two agents engaged in a goal-oriented play centered around image identification. By filtering for successful game interactions, we automatically curate a high-quality dataset of interleaved images and text. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on this synthetic data leads to performance gains on downstream tasks and generalises across datasets. Moreover, as the improvements in the model lead to better game play, this procedure can be applied iteratively. This work paves the way for self-improving VLMs, with potential applications in various real-world scenarios especially when the high-quality multimodal data is scarce.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods heavily depend on training data from a limited set of handcrafted articulated object categories (e.g., cabinets and drawers), which restricts their ability to model a wide range of articulated objects in an open-vocabulary context. To address these limitations, we propose Articulate Anymesh, an automated framework that is able to convert any rigid 3D mesh into its articulated counterpart in an open-vocabulary manner. Given a 3D mesh, our framework utilizes advanced Vision-Language Models and visual prompting techniques to extract semantic information, allowing for both the segmentation of object parts and the construction of functional joints. Our experiments show that Articulate Anymesh can generate large-scale, high-quality 3D articulated objects, including tools, toys, mechanical devices, and vehicles, significantly expanding the coverage of existing 3D articulated object datasets. Additionally, we show that these generated assets can facilitate the acquisition of new articulated object manipulation skills in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real robotic system.

Personalization of LVLMs is an emerging area that involves customizing models to recognize specific object instances and provide tailored responses. However, existing approaches rely on time-consuming test-time training for each user and object, rendering them impractical. This paper proposes a novel, training-free approach to LVLM personalization by leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinct features, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to recognize instances in the visual input, and visual prompting methods. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables flexible and efficient personalization without extensive retraining. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, outperforming conventional training-based approaches and establish a new standard for LVLM personalization.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 37.44% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

Although prior Test-Time Training (TTT) techniques for VLMs have demonstrated robust performance, they predominantly rely on tuning text prompts, a process that demands substantial computational resources and is heavily dependent on entropy-based loss. In this paper, we propose LoRA-TTT, a novel TTT method that leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), applied exclusively to the image encoder of VLMs. By introducing LoRA and updating only its parameters during test time, our method offers a simple yet effective TTT approach, retaining the model's initial generalization capability while achieving substantial performance gains with minimal memory and runtime overhead. Additionally, we introduce a highly efficient reconstruction loss tailored for TTT. Our method can adapt to diverse domains by combining these two losses, without increasing memory consumption or runtime. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, covering 15 datasets, demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP-ViT-B/16 by an average of 5.79% on the OOD benchmark and 1.36% on the fine-grained benchmark, efficiently surpassing test-time prompt tuning, without relying on any external models or cache.</p></details> |  |

However, existing UI datasets either only provide large-scale context-free element annotations or contextualized functional descriptions for elements at a much smaller scale. In this work, we propose the \methodname{} pipeline for automatically annotating UI elements with detailed functionality descriptions at scale. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to infer element functionality by comparing the UI content changes before and after simulated interactions with specific UI elements. To improve annotation quality, we propose LLM-aided rejection and verification, eliminating invalid and incorrect annotations without human labor. We construct an \methodname{}-704k dataset using the proposed pipeline, featuring multi-resolution, multi-device screenshots, diverse data domains, and detailed functionality annotations that have never been provided by previous datasets. Human evaluation shows that the AutoGUI pipeline achieves annotation correctness comparable to trained human annotators. Extensive experimental results show that our \methodname{}-704k dataset remarkably enhances VLM's UI grounding capabilities, exhibits significant scaling effects, and outperforms existing web pre-training data types.

By using multimodal data fusion, our approach integrates semantic and visual representations, enabling precise interpretation of driving scenarios and accurate forecasting of potential dangers. Through supervised fine-tuning of VLMs, we optimize spatial hazard localization using attention-based mechanisms and coordinate regression techniques. Experimental results on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate a substantial improvement in hazard prediction straightforwardness and accuracy over existing models, achieving a notable increase in generalization performance. This advancement enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous driving systems, ensuring improved situational awareness and potential decision-making in complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.13080v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2007.14747v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
