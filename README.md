| **[Tailored Forecasting from Short Time Series via Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16325v1)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.16325v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models can be effective for forecasting the dynamics of unknown systems from time-series data, but they often require large amounts of data and struggle to generalize across systems with varying dynamics. Combined, these issues make forecasting from short time series particularly challenging. To address this problem, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting from Related Time Series (METAFORS), which uses related systems with longer time-series data to supplement limited data from the system of interest. By leveraging a library of models trained on related systems, METAFORS builds tailored models to forecast system evolution with limited data. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate METAFORS' ability to predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics, even when test and related systems exhibit significantly different behaviors and the available data are scarce, highlighting its robustness and versatility in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215v1)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.16215v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.16178v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

| **[Contrastive Representation Learning Helps Cross-institutional Knowledge Transfer: A Study in Pediatric Ventilation Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13587v2)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13587v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical machine learning deployment across institutions faces significant challenges when patient populations and clinical practices differ substantially. We present a systematic framework for cross-institutional knowledge transfer in clinical time series, demonstrated through pediatric ventilation management between a general pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and a cardiac-focused unit. Using contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning, we investigate how different data regimes and fine-tuning strategies affect knowledge transfer across institutional boundaries. Our results show that while direct model transfer performs poorly, CPC with appropriate fine-tuning enables effective knowledge sharing between institutions, with benefits particularly evident in limited data scenarios. Analysis of transfer patterns reveals an important asymmetry: temporal progression patterns transfer more readily than point-of-care decisions, suggesting practical pathways for cross-institutional deployment. Through a systematic evaluation of fine-tuning approaches and transfer patterns, our work provides insights for developing more generalizable clinical decision support systems while enabling smaller specialized units to leverage knowledge from larger centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v4)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.08114v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'25 |

Inspired by large language models, there is interest in developing large time series models (LTM) to address these issues. However, current methods struggle with training complexity, adapting human feedback, and achieving high predictive accuracy. We introduce TimeHF, a novel pipeline for creating LTMs with 6 billion parameters, incorporating human feedback. We use patch convolutional embedding to capture long time series information and design a human feedback mechanism called time-series policy optimization. Deployed in JD.com's supply chain, TimeHF handles automated replenishment for over 20,000 products, improving prediction accuracy by 33.21% over existing methods. This work advances LTM technology and shows significant industrial benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-Graphormer: Using Transformers for Spatiotemporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13274v2)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13274v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data is ubiquitous, and forecasting it has important applications in many domains. However, its complex spatial dependencies and non-linear temporal dynamics can be challenging for traditional techniques. Existing methods tackle these challenges by learning the two dimensions separately. Here, we introduce Temporal Graphormer (T-Graphormer), a Transformer-based approach capable of modelling spatiotemporal correlations simultaneously. By incorporating temporal dynamics in the Graphormer architecture, each node attends to all other nodes within the graph sequence. Our design enables the model to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns with minimal reliance on predefined spacetime inductive biases. We validate the effectiveness of T-Graphormer on real-world traffic prediction benchmark datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, T-Graphormer reduces root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by up to 10%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Reservoir Computing for Chaotic Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15615v1)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15615v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing was shown in recent years to be useful as efficient to learn networks in the field of time series tasks. Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.01418v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

| **[Guaranteed Multidimensional Time Series Prediction via Deterministic Tensor Completion Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15388v1)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15388v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the prediction of multidimensional time series data has become increasingly important due to its wide-ranging applications. Tensor-based prediction methods have gained attention for their ability to preserve the inherent structure of such data. However, existing approaches, such as tensor autoregression and tensor decomposition, often have consistently failed to provide clear assertions regarding the number of samples that can be exactly predicted. While matrix-based methods using nuclear norms address this limitation, their reliance on matrices limits accuracy and increases computational costs when handling multidimensional data. To overcome these challenges, we reformulate multidimensional time series prediction as a deterministic tensor completion problem and propose a novel theoretical framework. Specifically, we develop a deterministic tensor completion theory and introduce the Temporal Convolutional Tensor Nuclear Norm (TCTNN) model. By convolving the multidimensional time series along the temporal dimension and applying the tensor nuclear norm, our approach identifies the maximum forecast horizon for exact predictions. Additionally, TCTNN achieves superior performance in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods across diverse real-world datasets, including climate temperature, network flow, and traffic ride data. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/TCTNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Transfer Learning Framework for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate IoT Traffic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15365v1)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15365v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, rapid technological advancements and expanded Internet access have led to a significant rise in anomalies within network traffic and time-series data. Prompt detection of these irregularities is crucial for ensuring service quality, preventing financial losses, and maintaining robust security standards. While machine learning algorithms have shown promise in achieving high accuracy for anomaly detection, their performance is often constrained by the specific conditions of their training data. A persistent challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled data for anomaly detection in time-series datasets. This limitation hampers the training efficacy of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning models. To address this, unsupervised transfer learning emerges as a viable solution, leveraging unlabeled data from a source domain to identify anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, many existing approaches still depend on a small amount of labeled data from the target domain. To overcome these constraints, we propose a transfer learning-based model for anomaly detection in multivariate time-series datasets. Unlike conventional methods, our approach does not require labeled data in either the source or target domains. Empirical evaluations on novel intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing techniques in accurately identifying anomalies within an entirely unlabeled target domain.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models face challenges in identifying critical components for prediction, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose the Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting. Ister decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, further modeling multi-periodicity and inter-series dependencies using a Dual Transformer architecture. We introduce a novel Dot-attention mechanism that improves interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ister outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 10% improvement in MSE. Moreover, Ister enables intuitive visualization of component contributions, shedding lights on model's decision process and enhancing transparency in prediction results.</p></details> |  |

Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</p></details> |  |

Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture of Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Prediction and Explanation in Time-Series Transformers via Shapley-based Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15070v1)** | 2025-01-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15070v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose ShapTST, a framework that enables time-series transformers to efficiently generate Shapley-value-based explanations alongside predictions in a single forward pass. Shapley values are widely used to evaluate the contribution of different time-steps and features in a test sample, and are commonly generated through repeatedly inferring on each sample with different parts of information removed. Therefore, it requires expensive inference-time computations that occur at every request for model explanations. In contrast, our framework unifies the explanation and prediction in training through a novel Shapley-based pre-training design, which eliminates the undesirable test-time computation and replaces it with a single-time pre-training. Moreover, this specialized pre-training benefits the prediction performance by making the transformer model more effectively weigh different features and time-steps in the time-series, particularly improving the robustness against data noise that is common to raw time-series data. We experimentally validated our approach on eight public datasets, where our time-series model achieved competitive results in both classification and regression tasks, while providing Shapley-based explanations similar to those obtained with post-hoc computation. Our work offers an efficient and explainable solution for time-series analysis tasks in the safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted to 21st IEEE CSPA 2025</p></details> |

Smart homes is one such domain where bulk of data is being generated and anomaly detection is one of the many challenges addressed by researchers in recent years. Contextual anomaly is a kind of anomaly that may show deviation from the normal pattern like point or sequence anomalies, but it also requires prior knowledge about the data domain and the actions that caused the deviation. Recent studies based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have demonstrated strong performance in anomaly detection. This study explores the impact of automatically tuned hyperparamteres on Unsupervised Online Contextual Anomaly Detection (UoCAD) approach by proposing UoCAD with Optimised Hyperparamnters (UoCAD-OH). UoCAD-OH conducts hyperparameter optimisation on Bi-LSTM model in an offline phase and uses the fine-tuned hyperparameters to detect anomalies during the online phase.

While contrastive learning has gained momentum in the time series domain for its prowess in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, its straightforward application to anomaly detection is not without hurdles. Firstly, contrastive learning typically requires negative sampling to avoid the representation collapse issue, where the encoder converges to a constant solution. However, drawing from the same dataset for dissimilar samples is ill-suited for TSAD as most samples are ``normal'' in the training dataset. Secondly, conventional contrastive learning focuses on instance discrimination, which may overlook anomalies that are detectable when compared to their temporal context. In this study, we propose a novel approach, CNT, that incorporates a window-based contrastive learning strategy fortified with learnable transformations. This dual configuration focuses on capturing temporal anomalies in local regions while simultaneously mitigating the representation collapse issue. Our theoretical analysis validates the effectiveness of CNT in circumventing constant encoder solutions. Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world industrial datasets, we show the superiority of our framework by outperforming various baselines and model variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) offer an alternative approach, utilizing neural networks combined with ODE solvers to learn continuous latent representations through parameterized vector fields. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) extend Neural ODEs by incorporating a diffusion term, although this addition is not trivial, particularly when addressing irregular intervals and missing values. Consequently, careful design of drift and diffusion functions is crucial for maintaining stability and enhancing performance, while incautious choices can result in adverse properties such as the absence of strong solutions, stochastic destabilization, or unstable Euler discretizations, significantly affecting Neural SDEs' performance. In this study, we propose three stable classes of Neural SDEs: Langevin-type SDE, Linear Noise SDE, and Geometric SDE. Then, we rigorously demonstrate their robustness in maintaining excellent performance under distribution shift, while effectively preventing overfitting. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets for interpolation, forecasting, and classification tasks, and analyze the robustness of our methods with 30 public datasets under different missing rates.

While real-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSA models rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potential of textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the first multi-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains. Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, the first-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipelining multimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensive experiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality, evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40% in domains with rich textual data.

While most time series databases and systems rely on lossless compression, lossy techniques offer even greater space-saving with a small loss in precision. However, the unknown impact on downstream analytics applications requires a semi-manual trial-and-error exploration. We initiate work on lossy compression that provides guarantees on complex statistical features (which are strongly correlated with the accuracy of the downstream analytics). Specifically, we propose a new lossy compression method that provides guarantees on the autocorrelation and partial-autocorrelation functions (ACF/PACF) of a time series. Our method leverages line simplification techniques as well as incremental maintenance of aggregates, blocking, and parallelization strategies for effective and efficient compression. The results show that our method improves compression ratios by 2x on average and up to 54x on selected datasets, compared to previous lossy and lossless compression methods. Moreover, we maintain -- and sometimes even improve -- the forecasting accuracy by preserving the autocorrelation properties of the time series. Our framework is extensible to multivariate time series and other statistical features of the time series.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

However, employing self-attention with variate tokens incurs a quadratic computational cost with respect to the number of variates, thus limiting its training efficiency for large-scale applications. To address this issue, we propose VarDrop, a simple yet efficient strategy that reduces the token usage by omitting redundant variate tokens during training. VarDrop adaptively excludes redundant tokens within a given batch, thereby reducing the number of tokens used for dot-product attention while preserving essential information. Specifically, we introduce k-dominant frequency hashing (k-DFH), which utilizes the ranked dominant frequencies in the frequency domain as a hash value to efficiently group variate tokens exhibiting similar periodic behaviors. Then, only representative tokens in each group are sampled through stratified sampling. By performing sparse attention with these selected tokens, the computational cost of scaled dot-product attention is significantly alleviated. Experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that VarDrop outperforms existing efficient baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection. Through evaluation results, we demonstrate that Argos outperforms state-of-the-art methods, increasing $F_1$ scores by up to $9.5\%$ and $28.3\%$ on public anomaly detection datasets and an internal dataset collected from Microsoft, respectively.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art architectures, while producing promising results on the UCR and the UEA archives , present a high number of trainable parameters. This can lead to long training with high CO2 emission, power consumption and possible increase in the number of FLoating-point Operation Per Second (FLOPS). In this paper, we present a new architecture for TSC, the Light Inception with boosTing tEchnique (LITE) with only 2.34% of the number of parameters of the state-of-the-art InceptionTime model, while preserving performance. This architecture, with only 9, 814 trainable parameters due to the usage of DepthWise Separable Convolutions (DWSC), is boosted by three techniques: multiplexing, custom filters, and dilated convolution. The LITE architecture, trained on the UCR, is 2.78 times faster than InceptionTime and consumes 2.79 times less CO2 and power. To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture on multivariate time series data, we adapt LITE to handle multivariate time series, we call this version LITEMV. To bring theory into application, we also conducted experiments using LITEMV on multivariate time series representing human rehabilitation movements, showing that LITEMV not only is the most efficient model but also the best performing for this application on the Kimore dataset, a skeleton based human rehabilitation exercises dataset. Moreover, to address the interpretability of LITEMV, we present a study using Class Activation Maps to understand the classification decision taken by the model during evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signals. In this contribution, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm and show that, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |

Modeling pairwise correlations between variables is crucial. Existing methods employ learnable graph structures and graph neural networks to explicitly model the spatial dependencies between variables. However, these methods are primarily based on prediction or reconstruction tasks, which can only learn similarity relationships between sequence embeddings and lack interpretability in how graph structures affect time series evolution. In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through changes in causal patterns. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves more accurate anomaly detection compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Our work is based on the assumption that the frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of series across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust representation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the complex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Transformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture cross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed independently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a low-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be attributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the strong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this, we enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional learnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1 normalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention mechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity, traffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention mechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art Transformer-based forecasters.</p></details> |  |

The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression.

However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a taxonomy of embedding techniques, categorizing them based on their theoretical foundations and application contexts. Unlike previous surveys, our work provides a quantitative evaluation of representative methods from each category by assessing their performance on downstream classification tasks across diverse real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of embedding methods varies significantly depending on the dataset and classification algorithm used, highlighting the importance of careful model selection and extensive experimentation for specific applications, including engineering systems. To facilitate further research and practical applications, we provide an open-source code repository implementing these embedding methods. This study contributes to the field by offering a systematic comparison of time series embedding techniques, guiding practitioners in selecting appropriate methods for their specific applications, and providing a foundation for future advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 29 figures |

Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy.

However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most critical ones through patch-specific filtering. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter.

This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new paradigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond what classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we pursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a specific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a traffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we possess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application of quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This technique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as traffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state. Aside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in comparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with classical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when the number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical models demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that increasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy. These findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data re-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models and could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS environments.</p></details> |  |

Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |

Different spacecraft configurations (inertial parameter sets) are simulated under different actuation profiles, in order to produce an optimised time-series clustering classifier that can be used to distinguish between them. The actuation is comprised of finite sequences of constant inputs that are applied in order, based on typical actuators available. By learning from the system's responses across multiple input sequences, and then applying measures of time-series similarity and F1-score, an optimal actuation sequence can be chosen either for one specific system configuration or for the overall set of possible configurations. This allows for both estimation of the inertial parameter set without any prior knowledge of state, as well as validation of transitions between different configurations after a deployment event. The optimisation of the actuation sequence is handled by a reinforcement learning model that uses the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm, by repeatedly trying different sequences and evaluating the impact on classifier performance according to a multi-objective metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 18 figures, 1 table.

Key findings demonstrate candlestick patterns do not improve model performance over only image data in our research. The significance is illuminating limitations in candlestick image signals.

| **[Automatic selection of the best neural architecture for time series forecasting via multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12215v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets. While models such as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become standard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a challenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the datasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model controversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for time series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse network architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM blocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines the number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific requirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimal architectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a user-defined preference function. We validate our framework across four distinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM is usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, when maximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures are often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific configurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve trade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal architectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is universally optimal for time series forecasting. Instead, the best-performing model emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-defined criteria and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning Systems for Time-Series Power Consumption Prediction with Multi-Head Embedding Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12136v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12136v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction is increasingly popular in a variety of applications, such as smart factories and smart transportation. Researchers have used various techniques to predict power consumption, but existing models lack discussion of collaborative learning and privacy issues among multiple clients. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Head Heterogeneous Federated Learning (MHHFL) systems that consist of multiple head networks, which independently act as carriers for federated learning. In the federated period, each head network is embedded into 2-dimensional vectors and shared with the centralized source pool. MHHFL then selects appropriate source networks and blends the head networks as knowledge transfer in federated learning. The experimental results show that the proposed MHHFL systems significantly outperform the benchmark and state-of-the-art systems and reduce the prediction error by 24.9% to 94.1%. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in the MHHFL (head network embedding and selection mechanisms), which significantly outperforms traditional federated average and random transfer.</p></details> |  |

We design dense and sparse feature tensors to deal with the sparsity of data sources. Heterogeneous federated learning is developed to share asynchronous parts of networks and select appropriate models for knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that the proposed HFL achieves the lowest prediction error among all benchmark systems on eight out of ten prediction tasks, with MSE reduction of 94.8%, 48.3%, and 52.1% compared to the benchmark systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HFL in transferring knowledge from heterogeneous domains, especially in the smaller target domain. Ablation studies then demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed mechanisms for heterogeneous domain selection and switching in predicting healthcare time series with privacy, model security, and heterogeneous knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |

In practice, situations often involve a mix of segment-level labels (detected abnormal events with segments of time points) and unlabeled data (undetected events), while the ideal algorithmic outcome should be point-level predictions. Therefore, the huge label information gap between training data and targets makes the task challenging. In this study, we formulate the above imperfect information as noisy labels and propose NRdetector, a noise-resilient framework that incorporates confidence-based sample selection, robust segment-level learning, and data-centric point-level detection for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Particularly, to bridge the information gap between noisy segment-level labels and missing point-level labels, we develop a novel loss function that can effectively mitigate the label noise and consider the temporal features. It encourages the smoothness of consecutive points and the separability of points from segments with different labels. Extensive experiments on real-world multivariate time series datasets with 11 different evaluation metrics demonstrate that NRdetector consistently achieves robust results across multiple real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines adapted to operate in our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'25)</p></details> |

To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</p></details> |  |

The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0. This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles. Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry.</p></details> |  |

Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that existing dynamic loss weighting methods can achieve this objective and provide insights into why this might be the case. Additionally, we propose an extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- which also achieves this objective.</p></details> |  |

However, predicting RUL is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics of the degradation caused by complex chemical reactions. Machine learning allows precise predictions by learning the latent functions of degradation relationships based on cycling behavior. This study introduces an accurate RUL prediction approach based on feature engineering and DLinear, applied to the dataset from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence. Among the 20 features generated from current, voltage, temperature, and time provided in this dataset, key features contributing to degradation are selected using Pearson correlation coefficient and Shapley values. Shapley value-based feature selection effectively reflects cell-to-cell variability, showing similar importance rankings across all cells. The DLinear-based RUL prediction using key features efficiently captures the time-series trend, demonstrating significantly better performance compared to Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |

Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |

These techniques suffer from parameter updating in real-time use cases, especially when the system parameters are likely to change during or between processes. Recently, the OASIS [Bhadriraju et al. 2020] framework introduced a data-driven technique to address the limitations of real-time dynamical system parameters updating, yielding interesting results. Nevertheless, we show in this work that superior performance can be achieved using more advanced model architectures. We present an innovative encoding approach, based mainly on the use of Set Encoding methods of sequence data, which give accurate adaptive model identification for complex dynamic systems, with variable input time series length. Two Set Encoding methods are used, the first is Deep Set [Zaheer et al. 2017], and the second is Set Transformer [Lee et al. 2019]. Comparing Set Transformer to OASIS framework on Lotka Volterra for real-time local dynamical system identification and time series forecasting, we find that the Set Transformer architecture is well adapted to learning relationships within data sets. We then compare the two Set Encoding methods based on the Lorenz system for online global dynamical system identification. Finally, we trained a Deep Set model to perform identification and characterization of abnormalities for 1D heat-transfer problem.</p></details> |  |

Despite this extensive exploration, LLMs are yet to be used for the task of post-synthesis metric reasoning and estimation of HDL designs. In this paper, we assess the ability of LLMs to reason about post-synthesis metrics of Verilog designs. We introduce MetRex, a large-scale dataset comprising 25,868 Verilog HDL designs and their corresponding post-synthesis metrics, namely area, delay, and static power. MetRex incorporates a Chain of Thought (CoT) template to enhance LLMs' reasoning about these metrics. Extensive experiments show that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) boosts the LLM's reasoning capabilities on average by 37.0\%, 25.3\%, and 25.7\% on the area, delay, and static power, respectively. While SFT improves performance on our benchmark, it remains far from achieving optimal results, especially on complex problems. Comparing to state-of-the-art regression models, our approach delivers accurate post-synthesis predictions for 17.4\% more designs (within a 5\% error margin), in addition to offering a 1.7x speedup by eliminating the need for pre-processing. This work lays the groundwork for advancing LLM-based Verilog code metric reasoning.</p></details> |  |

An Evaluation on Modified Visualizations to Test Generalization in Data Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16277v1)** | 2025-01-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.16277v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we assess the visualization literacy of two prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), the backend of ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini, previously known as Bard, to establish benchmarks for assessing their visualization capabilities. While LLMs have shown promise in generating chart descriptions, captions, and design suggestions, their potential for evaluating visualizations remains under-explored. Collecting data from humans for evaluations has been a bottleneck for visualization research in terms of both time and money, and if LLMs were able to serve, even in some limited role, as evaluators, they could be a significant resource. To investigate the feasibility of using LLMs in the visualization evaluation process, we explore the extent to which LLMs possess visualization literacy -- a crucial factor for their effective utility in the field. We conducted a series of experiments using a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) for GPT-4 and Gemini. Our findings indicate that the LLMs we explored currently fail to achieve the same levels of visualization literacy when compared to data from the general public reported in VLAT, and LLMs heavily relied on their pre-existing knowledge to answer questions instead of utilizing the information provided by the visualization when answering questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the article that has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

These studies have excelled in mathematical competitions like IMO, showing significant progress. However, these studies intertwined multiple skills simultaneously, i.e., problem-solving, reasoning, and writing formal specifications, making it hard to precisely identify the LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in each task. This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and decomposes it into six sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six formal-verification-related tasks by distilling GPT-4o. They are split into a 14k+ fine-tuning dataset FM-alpaca and a 4k benchmark FM-Bench. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps. Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most. Interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances mathematics, reasoning, and coding abilities. We hope our findings inspire further research. Fine-tuned models are released to facilitate subsequent studies</p></details> | 13 pages |

Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are now various platforms publishing exclusively in Naija such as Naija Wikipedia. However, it is hard to distinguish by non-native from a larger pidgin languages spoken across West Africa known as West African Pidgin English (WAPE) -- which is more simplied and understandable by wider audience in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon. BBC news platform publishes exclusively in WAPE to cater for several countries in West Africa. In our paper, we show through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments that these two creole varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is under-represented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (findings)</p></details> |

Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency issues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to TOSEM, 2025</p></details> |

Supervised methods are adept at text categorization, yet the dynamic nature of social media discussions poses a continual challenge for these techniques due to the constant shifting of the focus. On the other hand, traditional unsupervised methods for extracting themes from public discourse, such as topic modeling, often reveal overarching patterns that might not capture specific nuances. Consequently, a significant portion of research into social media discourse still depends on labor-intensive manual coding techniques and a human-in-the-loop approach, which are both time-consuming and costly. In this work, we study the problem of discovering arguments associated with a specific theme. We propose a generic LLMs-in-the-Loop strategy that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract latent arguments from social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 14k Facebook ads with 25 themes and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads with 14 themes.

Using evolutionary game theory, we simulate populations of agents with different strategic dispositions (aggressive, cooperative, or neutral) and observe their evolutionary dynamics. Our findings reveal that different LLMs exhibit distinct biases affecting the relative success of aggressive versus cooperative strategies. This research provides insights into the potential long-term behaviour of systems of deployed LLM-based autonomous agents and highlights the importance of carefully considering the strategic environments in which they operate.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (10 including references), 4 figures</p></details> |

However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests.

We present PRISMe (Privacy Risk Information Scanner for Me), a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven privacy policy assessment tool, which helps users to understand the essence of a lengthy, complex privacy policy while browsing. The tool, a browser extension, integrates a dashboard and an LLM chat. One major contribution is the first rigorous evaluation of such a tool. In a mixed-methods user study (N=22), we evaluate PRISMe's efficiency, usability, understandability of the provided information, and impacts on awareness. While our tool improves privacy awareness by providing a comprehensible quick overview and a quality chat for in-depth discussion, users note issues with consistency and building trust in the tool.

Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users. In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models. However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios. We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges. FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Adanonymizer, an anonymization plug-in that allows users to control this balance by navigating a trade-off curve. A survey (N=221) revealed a privacy paradox, where users frequently disclosed sensitive information despite acknowledging privacy risks. The study further demonstrated that privacy risks were not significantly correlated with model output performance, highlighting the potential to navigate this trade-off. Adanonymizer normalizes privacy and utility ratings by type and automates the pseudonymization of sensitive terms based on user preferences, significantly reducing user effort. Its 2D color palette interface visualizes the privacy-utility trade-off, allowing users to adjust the balance by manipulating a point. An evaluation (N=36) compared Adanonymizer with ablation methods and differential privacy techniques, where Adanonymizer significantly reduced modification time, achieved better perceived model performance and overall user preference.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

These methods claim superior alignment by virtue of better correspondence with human pairwise preferences, often measured by LLM-judges. In this work, we attempt to answer the following question -- do LLM-judge preferences translate to progress on other, more concrete metrics for alignment, and if not, why not? We define a concrete metric for alignment, and introduce SOS-Bench (Substance Outweighs Style Benchmark), which is to the best of our knowledge the largest standardized, reproducible LLM meta-benchmark to date. We find that (1) LLM-judge preferences do not correlate with concrete measures of safety, world knowledge, and instruction following; (2) LLM-judges have powerful implicit biases, prioritizing style over factuality and safety; and (3) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of post-training, and not the PO stage, has the greatest impact on alignment, with data scaling and prompt diversity as the driving factors.

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing knowledge from resource-intensive large models to smaller ones. Various strategies exist, some relying on the text generated by the teacher model and optionally utilizing his logits to enhance learning. However, these methods based on logits often require both teacher and student models to share the same tokenizer, limiting their applicability across different LLM families. In this paper, we introduce Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) loss, grounded in optimal transport, to address this limitation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ULD loss in enabling distillation across models with different architectures and tokenizers, paving the way to a more widespread use of distillation techniques.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

The traditional path planning techniques like DRL models typically trained for a given configuration of the starting point and target positions, these models only perform well when these conditions are satisfied. In this paper, we proposed a novel path planning framework that embeds Large Language Models to empower mobile robots with the capability of dynamically interpreting natural language commands and autonomously generating efficient, collision-free navigation paths. The proposed framework uses LLMs to translate high-level user inputs into actionable waypoints while dynamically adjusting paths in response to obstacles. We experimentally evaluated our proposed LLM-based approach across three different environments of progressive complexity, showing the robustness of our approach with llama3.1 model that outperformed other LLM models in path planning time, waypoint generation success rate, and collision avoidance. This underlines the promising contribution of LLMs for enhancing the capability of mobile robots, especially when their operation involves complex decisions in large and complex environments. Our framework has provided safer, more reliable navigation systems and opened a new direction for the future research.

However, their high expressive power makes it difficult to control outputs based on specific business instructions. In response, benchmarks focusing on the controllability of LLMs have been developed, but several issues remain: (1) They primarily cover major languages like English and Chinese, neglecting low-resource languages like Japanese; (2) Current benchmarks employ task-specific evaluation metrics, lacking a unified framework for selecting models based on controllability across different use cases. To address these challenges, this research introduces LCTG Bench, the first Japanese benchmark for evaluating the controllability of LLMs. LCTG Bench provides a unified framework for assessing control performance, enabling users to select the most suitable model for their use cases based on controllability.

This paper delves into the challenges of sustainable growth of cloud LLM inference, emphasizing extended amortization of CPU embodied over an increased lifespan. Given the reliability risks of silicon aging, we propose an aging-aware CPU core management technique to delay CPU aging effects, allowing the cluster operator to safely increase CPU life. Our technique exploits CPU underutilization patterns that we uncover in cloud LLM inference by halting aging in unused cores and even-outing aging in active cores via selective deep idling and aging-aware inference task allocation. Through extensive simulations using real-world Azure inference traces and an extended LLM cluster simulator from Microsoft, we show superior performance of our technique over existing methods with an estimated 37.67\% reduction in yearly embodied carbon emissions through p99 performance of managing CPU aging effects, a 77\% reduction in CPU underutilization, and less than 10\% impact to the inference service quality.</p></details> |  |

However, metrics like Krippendorff's $\alpha$ and Randolph's $\kappa$ were originally designed to measure the reliability of human labeling, thus make assumptions about typical human labeling behavior, and these assumptions may not be applicable to machine generated labels. In this paper, we show how *relying on a single aggregate correlation score* can obscure fundamental differences between human labels and those from automatic evaluation, including LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the proportion of samples with variation or uncertainty in human assigned labels is relatively high, machine labels (generated by automatic evaluation methods) may superficially appear to have similar or better correlation with the human majority label compared to the human-to-human (HH) correlation. This can create the illusion that labels from automatic evaluation approximates the human majority label. However, as the proportion of samples with consistent human labels increases, the correlation between machine and human labels fall well below HH correlation. Based on these findings, we first propose stratifying data by human label uncertainty to provide a more robust analysis of automatic evaluation performance. Second, recognizing that uncertainty and variation are inherent in perception-based human evaluations, such as those involving attitudes or preferences, we introduce a new metric - binned Jensen-Shannon Divergence for perception for such scenarios to better measure the effectiveness of automatic evaluations. We present visualization techniques -- perception charts, to contextualize correlation measures appropriately.

Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks. However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.</p></details> |  |

LLMs continue to be vulnerable to external threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, prior works tend to focus on performing white-box attacks, overlooking black-box settings. In this work, we propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack Tree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under black-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced stealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal that implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher attack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service response latency by over 250 $\times \uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage.

While research has largely focused on developing specialized graph LLMs through task-specific instruction tuning, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs solely through prompt design remains surprisingly absent. Without such a carefully crafted evaluation benchmark, most if not all, tailored graph LLMs are compared against general LLMs using simplistic queries (e.g., zero-shot reasoning with LLaMA), which can potentially camouflage many advantages as well as unexpected predicaments of them. To achieve more general evaluations and unveil the true potential of LLMs for graph tasks, we introduce Graph In-context Learning (GraphICL) Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark comprising novel prompt templates designed to capture graph structure and handle limited label knowledge. Our systematic evaluation shows that general-purpose LLMs equipped with our GraphICL outperform state-of-the-art specialized graph LLMs and graph neural network models in resource-constrained settings and out-of-domain tasks. These findings highlight the significant potential of prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on graph learning tasks without training and offer a strong baseline for advancing research in graph LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, as goal-oriented learning, which emphasizes efficiently achieving specific objectives, becomes increasingly important in professional contexts, existing ITSs often struggle to deliver this type of targeted learning experience. In this paper, we propose GenMentor, an LLM-powered multi-agent framework designed to deliver goal-oriented, personalized learning within ITS. GenMentor begins by accurately mapping learners' goals to required skills using a fine-tuned LLM trained on a custom goal-to-skill dataset. After identifying the skill gap, it schedules an efficient learning path using an evolving optimization approach, driven by a comprehensive and dynamic profile of learners' multifaceted status. Additionally, GenMentor tailors learning content with an exploration-drafting-integration mechanism to align with individual learner needs. Extensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate GenMentor's effectiveness in learning guidance and content quality. Furthermore, we have deployed it in practice and also implemented it as an application. Practical human study with professional learners further highlights its effectiveness in goal alignment and resource targeting, leading to enhanced personalization.

To address this issue, we propose a novel intuitive framework that, at its very core, performs MHA compression through a multi-head tensorisation process and the Tucker decomposition. This enables both higher-dimensional structured denoising and compression of the MHA weights, by enforcing a shared higher-dimensional subspace across the weights of the multiple attention heads. We demonstrate that this approach consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across multiple benchmark datasets, and for both encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, while achieving compression rates of up to $\sim 250$ times in the MHA weights, all without requiring any additional data, training, or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing FFN-only-based denoising techniques to achieve further improvements in LLM reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |

Current jailbreak methods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose challenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate semantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most existing approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs.In this paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking attack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking attack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series of customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted templates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search for any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel question-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts that maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length. Additionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect genuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs and compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For proprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs achieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively, exceeding existing baselines by more than 60\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can maintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of jailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack success rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates transferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |

Mental health professionals then examined the resulting conversation logs to uncover potential benefits and pitfalls. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based CR approach has the capability to adhere to core CR protocols, prompt Socratic questioning, and provide empathetic validation. However, issues of power imbalances, advice-giving, misunderstood cues, and excessive positivity reveal deeper challenges, including the potential to erode therapeutic rapport and ethical concerns.

To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines.

This study addresses this opportunity by investigating the integration of LLM-based AI into real-time classroom debates. Over four weeks, 22 students in a Design History course participated in three rounds of debates with support from ChatGPT. The findings reveal how learners prompted the AI to offer insights, collaboratively processed its outputs, and divided labor in team-AI interactions. The study also surfaces key advantages of AI usage, reducing social anxiety, breaking communication barriers, and providing scaffolding for novices, alongside risks, such as information overload and cognitive dependency, which could limit learners' autonomy.

This study introduces ValueActionLens, an evaluation framework to assess the alignment between LLMs' stated values and their value-informed actions. The framework encompasses the generation of a dataset comprising 14.8k value-informed actions across twelve cultures and eleven social topics, and two tasks to evaluate how well LLMs' stated value inclinations and value-informed actions align across three different alignment measures. Extensive experiments reveal that the alignment between LLMs' stated values and actions is sub-optimal, varying significantly across scenarios and models. Analysis of misaligned results identifies potential harms from certain value-action gaps. To predict the value-action gaps, we also uncover that leveraging reasoned explanations improves performance. These findings underscore the risks of relying solely on the LLMs' stated values to predict their behaviors and emphasize the importance of context-aware evaluations of LLM values and value-action gaps.</p></details> |  |

This study explores a large-scale data synthesis approach to equip LLMs with character generalization capabilities. We begin by synthesizing large-scale character profiles using personas from Persona Hub and then explore two strategies: response rewriting and response generation, to create character-aligned instructional responses. To validate the effectiveness of our synthetic instruction tuning data for character generalization, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the LLaMA-3 8B model. Our best-performing model strengthens the original LLaMA-3 8B Instruct model and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o models on role-playing dialogue. We release our synthetic characters and instruction-tuning dialogues to support public research.</p></details> |  |

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We refer to them as code-related benchmarks. However, there are no systematic guidelines by which such a benchmark should be developed to ensure its quality, reliability, and reproducibility. We propose How2Bench, which is comprised of a 55- 55-criteria checklist as a set of guidelines to govern the development of code-related benchmarks comprehensively. Using HOW2BENCH, we profiled 274 benchmarks released within the past decade and found concerning issues. Nearly 70% of the benchmarks did not take measures for data quality assurance; over 10% did not even open source or only partially open source. Many highly cited benchmarks have loopholes, including duplicated samples, incorrect reference codes/tests/prompts, and unremoved sensitive/confidential information. Finally, we conducted a human study involving 49 participants, which revealed significant gaps in awareness of the importance of data quality, reproducibility, and transparency.</p></details> | 42 pages |

However, their global applicability remains questionable due to unexplored biases across socio-demographic and geographic contexts. This study examines how LLMs perform across diverse populations by analyzing public surveys from Chile and the United States, focusing on predictive accuracy and fairness metrics. The results show performance disparities, with LLM consistently outperforming on U.S. datasets. This bias originates from the U.S.-centric training data, remaining evident after accounting for socio-demographic differences. In the U.S., political identity and race significantly influence prediction accuracy, while in Chile, gender, education, and religious affiliation play more pronounced roles. Our study presents a novel framework for measuring socio-demographic biases in LLMs, offering a path toward ensuring fairer and more equitable model performance across diverse socio-cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

SLoPe improves the accuracy of sparsely pretrained models by adding low-rank adapters in the final 1% iterations of pretraining without adding significant overheads to the model pretraining and inference. In addition, SLoPe uses a double-pruned backward pass formulation that prunes the transposed weight matrix using N:M sparsity structures to enable an accelerated sparse backward pass. SLoPe accelerates the training and inference of models with billions of parameters up to $1.25\times$ and $1.54\times$ respectively (OPT-33B and OPT-66B) while reducing their memory usage by up to $0.63\times$ and $0.61\times$ for training and inference respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR2025</p></details> |

By evaluating raw and LLM-corrected transcriptions of accented English in these regions, we assess the potential and limitations of LLMs to address challenges related to accents and medical terminology in ASR. Our findings highlight significant disparities in ASR accuracy across regions and identify specific conditions under which LLM corrections are most effective.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing & generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for automating code review, existing solutions face significant limitations in precision and practicality. This paper presents BitsAI-CR, an innovative framework that enhances code review through a two-stage approach combining RuleChecker for initial issue detection and ReviewFilter for precision verification. The system is built upon a comprehensive taxonomy of review rules and implements a data flywheel mechanism that enables continuous performance improvement through structured feedback and evaluation metrics.

In addition, the inherent complexity of the biomedical knowledge hierarchy significantly hampers efforts to bridge this gap.Can LLMs themselves play a pivotal role in overcoming this limitation? Motivated by this question, we investigate this challenge in the present study.We propose a framework that automates the distillation of high-quality textual training data from the extensive scientific literature. Our approach self-evaluates and generates questions that are more closely aligned with the biomedical domain, guided by the biomedical knowledge hierarchy through medical subject headings (MeSH). This comprehensive framework establishes an automated workflow, thereby eliminating the need for manual intervention. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the impact of our framework-generated data on downstream language models of varying sizes. Our approach substantially improves question-answering tasks compared to pre-trained models from the life sciences domain and powerful close-source models represented by GPT-4.

However, due to the limitations of context window size and the computational costs associated with Large Language Models (LLMs), current approaches primarily truncate user history by only considering the textual information of items from the most recent interactions in the input prompt. This truncation fails to fully capture the long-term behavioral patterns of users. To address this, we propose a multi-grained patching framework -- PatchRec. It compresses the textual tokens of an item title into a compact item patch, and further compresses multiple item patches into a denser session patch, with earlier interactions being compressed to a greater degree. The framework consists of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with item-level compression patterns, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which teaches LLMs to model sequences at multiple granularities. Through this simple yet effective approach, empirical results demonstrate that PatchRec outperforms existing methods, achieving significant performance gains with fewer tokens fed to the LLM. Specifically, PatchRec shows up to a 32% improvement in HR@20 on the Goodreads dataset over uncompressed baseline, while using only 7% of the tokens. This multi-grained sequence modeling paradigm, with an adjustable compression ratio, enables LLMs to be efficiently deployed in real-world recommendation systems that handle extremely long user behavior sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods often struggle to balance complex document relationships with precise information retrieval. In this paper, we introduce Contextualized Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CG-RAG), a novel framework that integrates sparse and dense retrieval signals within graph structures to enhance retrieval efficiency and subsequently improve generation quality for research question answering. First, we propose a contextual graph representation for citation graphs, effectively capturing both explicit and implicit connections within and across documents. Next, we introduce Lexical-Semantic Graph Retrieval (LeSeGR), which seamlessly integrates sparse and dense retrieval signals with graph encoding. It bridges the gap between lexical precision and semantic understanding in citation graph retrieval, demonstrating generalizability to existing graph retrieval and hybrid retrieval methods. Finally, we present a context-aware generation strategy that utilizes the retrieved graph-structured information to generate precise and contextually enriched responses using large language models (LLMs). Extensive experiments on research question answering benchmarks across multiple domains demonstrate that our CG-RAG framework significantly outperforms RAG methods combined with various state-of-the-art retrieval approaches, delivering superior retrieval accuracy and generation quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM application development. Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).</p></details> | 37 pages, 19 figures |

To help OSS identify vulnerability fix commits, several automated approaches are developed. However, existing approaches like VulFixMiner and CoLeFunDa, focus solely on code changes, neglecting essential context from development artifacts. Tools like Vulcurator, which integrates issue reports, fail to leverage semantic associations between different development artifacts (e.g., pull requests and history vulnerability fixes). Moreover, they miss vulnerability fixes in tangled commits and lack explanations, limiting practical use. Hence to address those limitations, we propose LLM4VFD, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to improve the accuracy of vulnerability fix detection. LLM4VFD comprises three components: (1) Code Change Intention, which analyzes commit summaries, purposes, and implications using Chain-of-Thought reasoning; (2) Development Artifact, which incorporates context from related issue reports and pull requests; (3) Historical Vulnerability, which retrieves similar past vulnerability fixes to enrich context. More importantly, on top of the prediction, LLM4VFD also provides a detailed analysis and explanation to help security experts understand the rationale behind the decision. We evaluated LLM4VFD against state-of-the-art techniques, including Pre-trained Language Model-based approaches and vanilla LLMs, using a newly collected dataset, BigVulFixes. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4VFD significantly outperforms the best-performed existing approach by 68.1%--145.4%. Furthermore, We conducted a user study with security experts, showing that the analysis generated by LLM4VFD improves the efficiency of vulnerability fix identification.</p></details> | Accepted in FSE 2025 |

Evidence in prior work seems to indicate yes, as pretrained models repeatedly demonstrate the ability to adapt to new language structures and vocabularies. However, this line of research typically considers languages that are present within common pretraining datasets, or otherwise share notable similarities with these seen languages. In contrast, in this work we attempt to measure models' language understanding capacity while circumventing the risk of dataset recall. We parameterize large families of language tasks recognized by deterministic finite automata (DFAs), and can thus sample novel language reasoning problems to fairly evaulate LLMs regardless of training data. We find that, even in the strikingly simple setting of 3-state DFAs, LLMs underperform unparameterized ngram models on both language recognition and synthesis tasks. These results suggest that LLMs struggle to match the ability of basic language models in recognizing and reasoning over languages that are sufficiently distinct from the ones they see at training time, underscoring the distinction between learning individual languages and possessing a general theory of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on almost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To help the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the prompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the selected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer, which is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the selected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated probability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in the response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer depends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide the reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a wide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more confident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This occurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is that this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the selected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and the reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated probabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in order to use them in evaluation procedures. Interestingly, the same behavior has been observed in humans, for whom explaining an answer increases confidence in its correctness.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing such datasets to uncover underlying events typically requires complex statistical methods and substantial domain expertise. A notable example, and the primary data focus of this paper, is the global synthetic dataset from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) -- a global hub of human trafficking data containing over 200,000 anonymized records spanning from 2002 to 2022, with numerous categorical features for each record. In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable method for analyzing and extracting significant categorical feature interactions, and querying large language models (LLMs) to generate data-driven insights that explain these interactions. Our approach begins with a binarization step for categorical features using one-hot encoding, followed by the computation of graph covariance at each time. This graph covariance quantifies temporal changes in dependence structures within categorical data and is established as a consistent dependence measure under the Bernoulli distribution. We use this measure to identify significant feature pairs, such as those with the most frequent trends over time or those exhibiting sudden spikes in dependence at specific moments. These extracted feature pairs, along with their timestamps, are subsequently passed to an LLM tasked with generating potential explanations of the underlying events driving these dependence changes. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulations, and its application to the CTDC dataset reveals meaningful feature pairs and potential data stories underlying the observed feature interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages main + 6 pages appendix</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our real-world studies reveal that over 60% of user requests to LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for knowledge sharing among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past responses leads to large quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce EchoLM, an in-context caching system that leverages historical requests as examples to guide response generation, enabling selective offloading of requests to more efficient LLMs. However, enabling this real-time knowledge transfer leads to intricate tradeoffs between response quality, latency, and system throughput at scale. For a new request, EchoLM identifies similar, high-utility examples and efficiently prepends them to the input for better response. At scale, EchoLM adaptively routes requests to LLMs of varying capabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. EchoLM employs a cost-aware cache replay mechanism to improve example quality and coverage offline, maximizing cache utility and runtime efficiency. Evaluations on millions of open-source requests demonstrate that EchoLM has a throughput improvement of 1.4-5.9x while reducing latency by 28-71% without hurting response quality on average.</p></details> |  |

Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.</p></details> |  |

These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.</p></details> |  |

However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.</p></details> |  |

Classical work on preference elicitation focuses on query-based techniques inspired from proper learning--often via proxies that interface between bidders and an auction mechanism--to incrementally learn bidder preferences as needed to compute efficient allocations. Although such elicitation mechanisms enjoy theoretical query efficiency, the amount of communication required may still be too cognitively taxing in practice. We propose a family of efficient LLM-based proxy designs for eliciting preferences from bidders using natural language. Our proposed mechanism combines LLM pipelines and DNF-proper-learning techniques to quickly approximate preferences when communication is limited. To validate our approach, we create a testing sandbox for elicitation mechanisms that communicate in natural language. In our experiments, our most promising LLM proxy design reaches approximately efficient outcomes with five times fewer queries than classical proper learning based elicitation mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges. CliMB-DC promises to empower domain experts from diverse domains -- healthcare, finance, social sciences and more -- to actively participate in driving real-world impact using ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Savel...</summary><p>Saveliev, Liu & Seedat contributed equally</p></details> |

Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</p></details> |  |

In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities.

However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems</p></details> |  |

Model-based visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in addressing these challenges but still faces notable limitations, particularly in handling sparse rewards and complex visual features in long-horizon environments. To address these limitations, we propose the Recognize-Sense-Plan-Act (RSPA) pipeline for long-horizon tasks and further introduce RoboHorizon, an LLM-assisted multi-view world model tailored for long-horizon robotic manipulation. In RoboHorizon, pre-trained LLMs generate dense reward structures for multi-stage sub-tasks based on task language instructions, enabling robots to better recognize long-horizon tasks. Keyframe discovery is then integrated into the multi-view masked autoencoder (MAE) architecture to enhance the robot's ability to sense critical task sequences, strengthening its multi-stage perception of long-horizon processes. Leveraging these dense rewards and multi-view representations, a robotic world model is constructed to efficiently plan long-horizon tasks, enabling the robot to reliably act through RL algorithms. Experiments on two representative benchmarks, RLBench and FurnitureBench, show that RoboHorizon outperforms state-of-the-art visual model-based RL methods, achieving a 23.35% improvement in task success rates on RLBench's 4 short-horizon tasks and a 29.23% improvement on 6 long-horizon tasks from RLBench and 3 furniture assembly tasks from FurnitureBench.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional methods for boundary value test input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all potential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or highly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test inputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through prompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based test input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage, comparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional boundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and limitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting common boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain areas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This research provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing, underscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated testing methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.</p></details> | preprint |

However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.</p></details> |  |

In response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection, explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation, and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for other human-centric fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

FireRedASR comprises two variants: FireRedASR-LLM: Designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and to enable seamless end-to-end speech interaction. It adopts an Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework leveraging large language model (LLM) capabilities. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-LLM (8.3B parameters) achieves an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 3.05%, surpassing the latest SOTA of 3.33% with an 8.4% relative CER reduction (CERR).

FireRedASR-AED: Designed to balance high performance and computational efficiency and to serve as an effective speech representation module in LLM-based speech models. It utilizes an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder (AED) architecture. On public Mandarin benchmarks, FireRedASR-AED (1.1B parameters) achieves an average CER of 3.18%, slightly worse than FireRedASR-LLM but still outperforming the latest SOTA model with over 12B parameters.

While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital. The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR'25), Singapore, Apr 2025</p></details> |

Recent research suggests using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the annotation process, reducing these costs while maintaining data quality. LLMs have shown promising results in annotating downstream tasks like hate speech detection and political framing. Building on the success in these areas, this study investigates whether LLMs are viable for annotating the complex task of media bias detection and whether a downstream media bias classifier can be trained on such data. We create annolexical, the first large-scale dataset for media bias classification with over 48000 synthetically annotated examples. Our classifier, fine-tuned on this dataset, surpasses all of the annotator LLMs by 5-9 percent in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and performs close to or outperforms the model trained on human-labeled data when evaluated on two media bias benchmark datasets (BABE and BASIL). This study demonstrates how our approach significantly reduces the cost of dataset creation in the media bias domain and, by extension, the development of classifiers, while our subsequent behavioral stress-testing reveals some of its current limitations and trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

While recent work has explored using LLM-generated data for fine-tuning, its impact on cross-domain generalization remains poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis revealing that fine-tuning with LLM-generated data not only improves target task performance but also reduces out-of-domain (OOD) degradation compared to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Through analyzing the data sequence in tasks of various domains, we demonstrate that this enhanced OOD robustness stems from a reduced prevalence of high perplexity tokens in LLM-generated sequences. Following this hypothesis we showed that masking high perplexity tokens in ground truth training data also achieves similar OOD preservation comparable to using LLM-generated data. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and scales, including Gemma2-2B, Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B, corroborate the consistency of our findings. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first mechanistic explanation for the superior OOD robustness conferred by LLM-generated training data, offering valuable insights for developing more robust fine-tuning strategies.</p></details> |  |

Balancing fairness and efficiency is critical for managing diverse client workloads with varying prefix patterns. Unfortunately, existing fair scheduling algorithms for LLM serving, such as Virtual Token Counter (VTC), fail to take prefix locality into consideration and thus suffer from poor performance. On the other hand, locality-aware scheduling algorithms in existing LLM serving frameworks tend to maximize the prefix cache hit rate without considering fair sharing among clients. This paper introduces the first locality-aware fair scheduling algorithm, Deficit Longest Prefix Match (DLPM), which can maintain a high degree of prefix locality with a fairness guarantee. We also introduce a novel algorithm, Double Deficit LPM (D$^2$LPM), extending DLPM for the distributed setup that can find a balance point among fairness, locality, and load-balancing. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of DLPM and D$^2$LPM in ensuring fairness while maintaining high throughput (up to 2.87$\times$ higher than VTC) and low per-client (up to 7.18$\times$ lower than state-of-the-art distributed LLM serving system) latency.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems face significant limitations, including the need for large datasets in few-shot learning methods, a lack of personalized and actionable feedback, and an overemphasis on benchmark performance rather than student experience. To address these challenges, we propose a Zero-Shot Large Language Model (LLM)-Based Automated Assignment Grading (AAG) system. This framework leverages prompt engineering to evaluate both computational and explanatory student responses without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The AAG system delivers tailored feedback that highlights individual strengths and areas for improvement, thereby enhancing student learning outcomes. Our study demonstrates the system's effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including survey responses from higher education students that indicate significant improvements in motivation, understanding, and preparedness compared to traditional grading methods. The results validate the AAG system's potential to transform educational assessment by prioritizing learning experiences and providing scalable, high-quality feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by main NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v3)** | 2025-01-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.12334v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

Recent research has proposed replacing SiLU with ReLU to induce significant activation sparsity and showed no downstream task accuracy degradation through fine tuning. However, taking full advantage of it required training a predictor to estimate this sparsity. In this paper, we introduce SparseInfer, a simple, light weight, and training free predictor for activation sparsity of ReLU field LLMs, in which activation sparsity is predicted by comparing only the sign bits of inputs and weights. To compensate for possible prediction inaccuracy, an adaptive tuning of the predictor's conservativeness is enabled, which can also serve as a control knob for optimizing LLM inference. The proposed method achieves approximately faster inference speed over the state of the art, with negligible accuracy loss of within 1%p.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose two novel methods to effectively utilize LLMs for low-resource text summarization: 1) MixSumm, an LLM-based data augmentation regime that synthesizes high-quality documents (short and long) for few-shot text summarization, and 2) PPSL, a prompt-based pseudolabeling strategy for sample-efficient semi-supervised text summarization. Specifically, MixSumm leverages the open-source LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate new documents by mixing topical information derived from a small seed set, and PPSL leverages the LLaMA-3-70b-Instruct model to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a semi-supervised learning setup. We evaluate our methods on the TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed datasets and use L-Eval, a LLaMA-3-based evaluation metric, and ROUGE scores to measure the quality of generated summaries. Our experiments on extractive and abstractive summarization show that MixSumm and PPSL achieve competitive ROUGE scores as a fully supervised method with 5% of the labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress.

At the core of these agents, an LLM must plan, execute, and respond using external tools, APIs, and custom functions. Research on tool calling has gathered momentum, but evaluation benchmarks and datasets representing the complexity of the tasks have lagged behind. In this work, we focus on one such complexity, nested sequencing, with the goal of extending existing benchmarks and evaluation. Specifically, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL contains 1800+ nested sequences where all the function calls are executable. Experimental results on multiple models and settings show that the best-performing model on the dataset has a full sequence match accuracy of 25% and win-rate of 34% necessitating a large scope for improvement in the nested sequencing aspect of function calling. Our analysis of these results provides possible future research directions for the community, in addition to a benchmark to track progress.

However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify.

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

The impact of longer contexts on mathematical reasoning remains under-explored. This study pioneers the investigation of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), which refers to the ability of LLMs to solve MWPs with extended narratives. We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs featuring lengthy narratives, and propose two novel metrics to evaluate the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in tackling these problems. Our analysis of existing zero-shot prompting techniques with proprietary LLMs along with open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these issues, we propose tailored approaches for different categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, we introduce a new instructional prompt designed to mitigate the impact of long contexts. For open-source LLMs, we develop a novel auxiliary task for fine-tuning to enhance CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing improved performance on E-GSM. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis to differentiate the effects of semantic understanding and reasoning efficacy, showing that our methods improves the latter. We also establish the generalizability of our methods across several other MWP benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs and offer practical solutions correspondingly, paving the way for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional methods necessitate text-based queries and manual subgraph explorations, often resulting in time-consuming processes. EICopilot, deployed as a chatbot via Baidu Enterprise Search, improves this landscape by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language queries. This solution automatically generates and executes Gremlin scripts, providing efficient summaries of complex enterprise relationships. Distinct feature a data pre-processing pipeline that compiles and annotates representative queries into a vector database of examples for In-context learning (ICL), a comprehensive reasoning pipeline combining Chain-of-Thought with ICL to enhance Gremlin script generation for knowledge graph search and exploration, and a novel query masking strategy that improves intent recognition for heightened script accuracy. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of EICopilot, including speed and accuracy, over baseline methods, with the \emph{Full Mask} variant achieving a syntax error rate reduction to as low as 10.00% and an execution correctness of up to 82.14%.

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |

Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality.

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was withdrawn due to a dispute among the authors regarding the content of the article</p></details> |

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images. Our method clearly outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page is available at: https://ygswu.github.io/NeuroPump.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

In response to these challenges, we propose a novel Color Balance Prior \textbf{Guided} \textbf{Hyb}rid \textbf{Sens}e \textbf{U}nderwater \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration framework (\textbf{GuidedHybSensUIR}). This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs. Extensive experiments underscores that our VarFormer outperforms existing multi-task image restoration methods across various restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project.

In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet.

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.20008v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention.

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17778v2)** | 2024-12-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.17778v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

While recent diffusion-based restoration methods, which leverage generative priors from text-to-image models, have made progress in recovering more realistic details, they still encounter "generative capability deactivation" when applied to out-of-distribution real-world data. To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Res-Captioner significantly enhances the generalization abilities of diffusion-based restoration models, while remaining fully plug-and-play.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), we propose ReF-LDM, an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our model integrates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, to leverage the reference images during the generation process. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling our LDM-based model to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces.

State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |

However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications.

To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/loraapage/</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/gendegpage/</p></details> |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

However, in real-world scenarios, images often suffer from combinations of multiple degradation factors. Existing multiple-in-one IR models encounter challenges related to degradation diversity and prompt singularity when addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-in-one IR model that can effectively restore images with both single and mixed degradations. To address degradation diversity, we design a Local Dynamic Optimization (LDO) module which dynamically processes degraded areas of varying types and granularities. To tackle the prompt singularity issue, we develop an efficient Conditional Feature Embedding (CFE) module that guides the decoder in leveraging degradation-type-related features, significantly improving the model's performance in mixed degradation restoration scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new dataset containing both single and mixed degradation elements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance not only on mixed degradation tasks but also on classic single-task restoration benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Unsupervised Underwater Neural Radiance Field U2NeRF, a transformer-based architecture that learns to render and restore novel views conditioned on multi-view geometry simultaneously. Due to the absence of supervision, we attempt to implicitly bake restoring capabilities onto the NeRF pipeline and disentangle the predicted color into several components - scene radiance, direct transmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light, and when combined reconstruct the underwater image in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we release an Underwater View Synthesis UVS dataset consisting of 12 underwater scenes, containing both synthetically-generated and real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, U2NeRF outperforms several baselines by as much LPIPS 11%, UIQM 5%, UCIQE 4% (on average) and showcases improved rendering and restoration capabilities.

Unlike Retinex-based methods, our approach utilizes two color spaces - LAB and YUV - to efficiently separate and process color information, by leveraging the separation of luminance from chromatic components in color images. In addition, our model incorporates the Transformer architecture to comprehensively understand image content while maintaining computational efficiency. To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, achieving more natural color restoration and a balanced brightness distribution.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Specifically, our method achieves PSNR scores of 29.22 on the Raindrop dataset, 30.76 on the Rain dataset, and 29.56 on the Snow100K dataset.

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.</p></details> |  |

Four generative models, including a standard GAN, a WGAN-GP, a U-net diffusion model, and a diffusion-GAN were assessed based on their ability to replicate spatial and statistical characteristics of windstorms. Different models have distinct strengths and limitations. The standard GAN displayed broader variability and limited alignment on the PCA dimensions. The WGAN-GP had a more balanced performance but occasionally misrepresented extreme events. The U-net diffusion model produced high-quality spatial patterns but consistently underestimated windstorm intensities. The diffusion-GAN performed better than the other models in general but overestimated extremes. An ensemble approach combining the strengths of these models could potentially improve their overall reliability. This study provides a foundation for such generative models in meteorological research and could potentially be applied in windstorm analysis and risk assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns.

We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.</p></details> | Preprint, 10 pages |

Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47). Our proposed solution is not only efficient but also compact in terms of the number of parameters required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7(L+\beta)^2L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)}(d+m_2(\mu))^{2(d+1)})$ time with $m_2(\mu)$ the second order moment of $\mu$. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from an $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R, L, \alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{LR^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</p></details> |  |

This enhances the alignment of our model with the objects in the input image without using external supervision. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in object discovery and image generation tasks across multiple datasets, including those with real images.

Our approach progressively generates textures that are consistent across multiple viewpoints with a depth-aware inpainting diffusion model, in an optimized sequence of viewpoints determined by an automatic view selection algorithm. A significant feature of our method is its remarkable efficiency, achieving a full texture generation within an end-to-end runtime of just 3.07 seconds on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, significantly outperforming existing methods. Such an acceleration is achieved by optimizations in the diffusion model and a specialized backprojection method. Moreover, our method reduces the artifacts in the backprojection phase, by selectively masking out non-frontal faces, and internal faces of open-surfaced objects. Experimental results demonstrate that Make-A-Texture matches or exceeds the quality of other state-of-the-art methods. Our work significantly improves the applicability and practicality of texture generation models for real-world 3D content creation, including interactive creation and text-guided texture editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025 Webpage: https://mukosame.github.io/make-a-texture/ Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ctqdx1uaj0</p></details> |

At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</p></details> | 58 pages, 20 figures |

Despite the discovery of thousands of inscriptions, a vast expanse of OBS remains undeciphered, casting a veil of mystery over this ancient language. The emergence of modern AI technologies presents a novel frontier for OBS decipherment, challenging traditional NLP methods that rely heavily on large textual corpora, a luxury not afforded by historical languages. This paper introduces a novel approach by adopting image generation techniques, specifically through the development of Oracle Bone Script Decipher (OBSD). Utilizing a conditional diffusion-based strategy, OBSD generates vital clues for decipherment, charting a new course for AI-assisted analysis of ancient languages. To validate its efficacy, extensive experiments were conducted on an oracle bone script dataset, with quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of OBSD.

We formulate this problem as an image inpainting task, allowing for more user control over the placement of mirrors during the generation process. To enable this, we create SynMirror, a large-scale dataset of diverse synthetic scenes with objects placed in front of mirrors. SynMirror contains around 198k samples rendered from 66k unique 3D objects, along with their associated depth maps, normal maps and instance-wise segmentation masks, to capture relevant geometric properties of the scene. Using this dataset, we propose a novel depth-conditioned inpainting method called MirrorFusion, which generates high-quality, realistic, shape and appearance-aware reflections of real-world objects. MirrorFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SynMirror, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully tackle the challenging problem of generating controlled and faithful mirror reflections of an object in a scene using diffusion-based models.

Recent advances in generative models, including diffusion models and geometric deep learning, have demonstrated promise in optimizing ligand generation. However, the scarcity of high-quality protein-ligand complex data and the inherent challenges in aligning generated ligands with target proteins limit the effectiveness of these methods. We propose BoKDiff, a novel framework that enhances ligand generation by combining multi-objective optimization and Best-of-K alignment methodologies. Built upon the DecompDiff model, BoKDiff generates diverse candidates and ranks them using a weighted evaluation of molecular properties such as QED, SA, and docking scores. To address alignment challenges, we introduce a method that relocates the center of mass of generated ligands to their docking poses, enabling accurate sub-component extraction. Additionally, we integrate a Best-of-N (BoN) sampling approach, which selects the optimal ligand from multiple generated candidates without requiring fine-tuning. BoN achieves exceptional results, with QED values exceeding 0.6, SA scores above 0.75, and a success rate surpassing 35%, demonstrating its efficiency and practicality. BoKDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, including a -8.58 average Vina docking score and a 26% success rate in molecule generation. This study is the first to apply Best-of-K alignment and Best-of-N sampling to SBDD, highlighting their potential to bridge generative modeling with practical drug discovery requirements.

For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves competitive sampling times while running on consumer-grade CPUs.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation.</p></details> |  |

With the limitation of privacy and safety in practice, the generative capability concerning NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts is undesirable, e.g., producing sexually explicit photos, and licensed images. The concept erasure task for T2I diffusion models has attracted considerable attention and requires an effective and efficient method. To achieve this goal, we propose a CE-SDWV framework, which removes the target concepts (e.g., NSFW concepts) of T2I diffusion models in the text semantic space by only adjusting the text condition tokens and does not need to re-train the original T2I diffusion model's weights. Specifically, our framework first builds a target concept-related word vocabulary to enhance the representation of the target concepts within the text semantic space, and then utilizes an adaptive semantic component suppression strategy to ablate the target concept-related semantic information in the text condition tokens. To further adapt the above text condition tokens to the original image semantic space, we propose an end-to-end gradient-orthogonal token optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on I2P and UnlearnCanvas benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

However, these studies fail to consider the impact of noisy samples in the training data, which results in diminished generalization capabilities and lower accuracy. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, this paper reveals that current DRO-based graph recommendation methods assign greater weight to noise distribution, leading to model parameter learning being dominated by it. When the model overly focuses on fitting noise samples in the training data, it may learn irrelevant or meaningless features that cannot be generalized to OOD data. To address this challenge, we design a Distributionally Robust Graph model for OOD recommendation (DRGO). Specifically, our method first employs a simple and effective diffusion paradigm to alleviate the noisy effect in the latent space. Additionally, an entropy regularization term is introduced in the DRO objective function to avoid extreme sample weights in the worst-case distribution. Finally, we provide a theoretical proof of the generalization error bound of DRGO as well as a theoretical analysis of how our approach mitigates noisy sample effects, which helps to better understand the proposed framework from a theoretical perspective. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework against three typical distribution shifts, and the results demonstrate its superiority in both independently and identically distributed distributions (IID) and OOD.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by WWW'25</p></details> |

The trained LoRA matrix can be integrated with the base model through addition or negation operation to improve performance on downstream tasks. However, the unauthorized use of LoRAs to generate harmful content highlights the need for effective mechanisms to trace their usage. A natural solution is to embed watermarks into LoRAs to detect unauthorized misuse. However, existing methods struggle when multiple LoRAs are combined or negation operation is applied, as these can significantly degrade watermark performance. In this paper, we introduce LoRAGuard, a novel black-box watermarking technique for detecting unauthorized misuse of LoRAs. To support both addition and negation operations, we propose the Yin-Yang watermark technique, where the Yin watermark is verified during negation operation and the Yang watermark during addition operation. Additionally, we propose a shadow-model-based watermark training approach that significantly improves effectiveness in scenarios involving multiple integrated LoRAs. Extensive experiments on both language and diffusion models show that LoRAGuard achieves nearly 100% watermark verification success and demonstrates strong effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Item is Worth a Prompt: Versatile Image Editing with Disentangled Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04880v4)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2403.04880v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We further observe that the stated sparsity pattern varies among different channels and evolves across time steps. To support this quantization and sparsity scheme, we present a novel diffusion model accelerator featuring a heterogeneous mixed-precision dense-sparse architecture, channel-last address mapping, and a time-step-aware sparsity detector for efficient handling of the sparsity pattern. Our 4-bit quantization technique demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing 4-bit methods.

The zero-shot generation of various visual content using a pretrained image diffusion model has been explored mainly in two directions. First, Diffusion Synchronization-performing reverse diffusion processes jointly across different projected spaces while synchronizing them in the target space-generates high-quality outputs when enough conditioning is provided, but it struggles in its absence. Second, Score Distillation Sampling-gradually updating the target space data through gradient descent-results in better coherence but often lacks detail. In this paper, we reveal for the first time the interconnection between these two methods while highlighting their differences. To this end, we propose StochSync, a novel approach that combines the strengths of both, enabling effective performance with weak conditioning. Our experiments demonstrate that StochSync provides the best performance in 360{\deg} panorama generation (where image conditioning is not given), outperforming previous finetuning-based methods, and also delivers comparable results in 3D mesh texturing (where depth conditioning is provided) with previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://stochsync.github.io/ (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

DSMs capture detailed elevations of natural and manmade features, crucial for applications like urban planning, vegetation studies, and 3D reconstruction. However, DSMs derived from stereo satellite imagery often contain voids or missing data due to occlusions, shadows, and lowsignal areas. Previous studies have primarily focused on void filling for digital elevation models (DEMs) and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs), employing methods such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation. While effective for simpler terrains, these approaches often fail to handle the intricate structures present in DSMs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dfilled, a guided DSM void filling method that leverages optical remote sensing images through edge-enhancing diffusion. Dfilled repurposes deep anisotropic diffusion models, which originally designed for super-resolution tasks, to inpaint DSMs. Additionally, we utilize Perlin noise to create inpainting masks that mimic natural void patterns in DSMs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dfilled surpasses traditional interpolation methods and deep learning approaches in DSM void filling tasks. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the method's ability to manage complex features and deliver accurate, visually coherent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> |

Yet, current methodologies predominantly depend on finetuned Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which face two critical limitations: (1) Finetuning imposes prohibitive computational overhead and long-term maintenance costs. (2) Finetuning narrows the pretrained knowledge distribution of MLLMs, reducing their adaptability to novel scenarios. These issues are exacerbated by the inherently dynamic nature of real-world I-TIR systems, where queries and image databases evolve in complexity and diversity, often deviating from static training distributions. To overcome these constraints, we propose Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a paradigm-shifting framework that bypasses MLLM finetuning entirely. DAR synergizes Large Language Model (LLM)-guided query refinement with Diffusion Model (DM)-based visual synthesis to create contextually enriched intermediate representations. This dual-modality approach deciphers nuanced user intent more holistically, enabling precise alignment between textual queries and visually relevant images. Rigorous evaluations across four benchmarks reveal DAR's dual strengths: (1) Matches state-of-the-art finetuned I-TIR models on straightforward queries without task-specific training. (2) Scalable Generalization: Surpasses finetuned baselines by 7.61% in Hits@10 (top-10 accuracy) under multi-turn conversational complexity, demonstrating robustness to intricate, distributionally shifted interactions. By eliminating finetuning dependencies and leveraging generative-augmented representations, DAR establishes a new trajectory for efficient, adaptive, and scalable cross-modal retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their potential, existing diffusion models struggle with inefficiencies as they map Gaussian noise to real point clouds, overlooking the geometric information inherent in sparse point clouds. To address these inefficiencies, we propose PUFM, a flow matching approach to directly map sparse point clouds to their high-fidelity dense counterparts. Our method first employs midpoint interpolation to sparse point clouds, resolving the density mismatch between sparse and dense point clouds. Since point clouds are unordered representations, we introduce a pre-alignment method based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) optimization to ensure coherent interpolation between sparse and dense point clouds, which enables a more stable learning path in flow matching. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior upsampling quality but with fewer sampling steps. Further experiments on ScanNet and KITTI also show that our approach generalizes well on RGB-D point clouds and LiDAR point clouds, making it more practical for real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Consequently, deepfake detection has become a pressing issue in today's world. While some existing methods focus on forgery features from either a local or global perspective, they often overlook the complementary nature of these features. Other approaches attempt to incorporate both local and global features but rely on simplistic strategies, such as cropping, which fail to capture the intricate relationships between local features. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that effectively combines local spatial-frequency domain features with global frequency domain information, capturing detailed and holistic forgery traces. Specifically, our method uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and sliding windows to tile forged features and leverages attention mechanisms to extract local spatial-frequency domain information. Simultaneously, the phase component of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is integrated with attention mechanisms to extract global frequency domain information, complementing the local features and ensuring the integrity of forgery detection. Comprehensive evaluations on open-world datasets generated by 34 distinct generative models demonstrate a significant improvement of 2.9% over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | under review |

While pruning strategies are well studied for discriminative models like those used in classification, little research has gone into their application to generative models. Generative models aim to estimate the underlying distribution of the data, so presumably they should benefit from larger datasets. In this work we aim to shed light on the accuracy of this statement, specifically answer the question of whether data pruning for generative diffusion models could have a positive impact. Contrary to intuition, we show that eliminating redundant or noisy data in large datasets is beneficial particularly when done strategically. We experiment with several pruning methods including recent-state-of-art methods, and evaluate over CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. We demonstrate that a simple clustering method outperforms other sophisticated and computationally demanding methods. We further exhibit how we can leverage clustering to balance skewed datasets in an unsupervised manner to allow fair sampling for underrepresented populations in the data distribution, which is a crucial problem in generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, under challenging physical conditions, this traditional coding and transmission paradigm often results in unrealistic reconstructions with perceptible blurring and aliasing artifacts, despite the inclusion of perceptual or adversarial losses for optimizing. This issue primarily stems from the receiver's limited knowledge about the underlying data manifold and the use of deterministic decoding mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces DiffCom, a novel end-to-end generative communication paradigm that utilizes off-the-shelf generative priors and probabilistic diffusion models for decoding, thereby improving perceptual quality without heavily relying on bandwidth costs and received signal quality. Unlike traditional systems that rely on deterministic decoders optimized solely for distortion metrics, our DiffCom leverages raw channel-received signal as a fine-grained condition to guide stochastic posterior sampling. Our approach ensures that reconstructions remain on the manifold of real data with a novel confirming constraint, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the generated outcomes. Furthermore, DiffCom incorporates a blind posterior sampling technique to address scenarios with unknown forward transmission characteristics. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that DiffCom not only produces realistic reconstructions with details faithful to the original data but also achieves superior robustness against diverse wireless transmission degradations. Collectively, these advancements establish DiffCom as a new benchmark in designing generative communication systems that offer enhanced robustness and generalization superiorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. We divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: the unconditional score function and the guided term. We design the MAP-based guided term estimation method, while the unconditional score function is approximated by an existing score network. To estimate the guided term, we base on the assumption that the space of clean natural images is inherently smooth, and introduce a MAP estimate of the $t$-th latent variable. We then substitute this estimation into the expression of the inverse problem and obtain the approximation of the guided term. We evaluate our method extensively on super-resolution, inpainting, and denoising tasks, and demonstrate comparable performance to DDRM, DMPS, DPS and $\Pi$GDM.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

To achieve effective speedup, the choice of the coarse propagator in the algorithm is vital. In this work, we investigate the use of {optimized} coarse propagators. Building upon the error estimation framework, we present a systematic procedure for constructing coarse propagators that enjoy desirable stability and consistent order. Additionally, we provide preliminary mathematical guarantees for the resulting parareal algorithm. Numerical experiments on a variety of settings, e.g., linear diffusion model, Allen-Cahn model, and viscous Burgers model, show that the optimizing procedure can significantly improve parallel efficiency when compared with the more ad hoc choice of some conventional and widely used coarse propagators.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Among the various conditions of motion generation, text can describe motion details elaborately and is easy to acquire, making text-to-motion(T2M) generation important. State-of-the-art T2M techniques mainly leverage diffusion models to generate motions with text prompts as guidance, tackling the many-to-many nature of T2M tasks. However, existing T2M approaches face challenges, given the gap between the natural language domain and the physical domain, making it difficult to generate motions fully consistent with the texts. We leverage kinematic phrases(KP), an intermediate representation that bridges these two modalities, to solve this. Our proposed method, KETA, decomposes the given text into several decomposed texts via a language model. It trains an aligner to align decomposed texts with the KP segments extracted from the generated motions. Thus, it's possible to restrict the behaviors for diffusion-based T2M models. During the training stage, we deploy the text-KP alignment loss as an auxiliary goal to supervise the models. During the inference stage, we refine our generated motions for multiple rounds in our decoder structure, where we compute the text-KP distance as the guidance signal in each new round. Experiments demonstrate that KETA achieves up to 1.19x, 2.34x better R precision and FID value on both backbones of the base model, motion diffusion model. Compared to a wide range of T2M generation models. KETA achieves either the best or the second-best performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Yet, aligning these models with user's intentions still involves a laborious trial-and-error process, and this challenging alignment problem has attracted considerable attention from the research community. In this work, instead of relying on fine-grained linguistic analyses of prompts, human annotation, or auxiliary vision-language models, we use Mutual Information (MI) to guide model alignment. In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.</p></details> | to appear at ICLR25 |

Traditional methods are often specialized for specific correspondence types, geometric, semantic, or temporal, whereas humans naturally identify alignments across these domains. Inspired by this flexibility, we propose MATCHA, a unified feature model designed to ``rule them all'', establishing robust correspondences across diverse matching tasks. Building on insights that diffusion model features can encode multiple correspondence types, MATCHA augments this capacity by dynamically fusing high-level semantic and low-level geometric features through an attention-based module, creating expressive, versatile, and robust features. Additionally, MATCHA integrates object-level features from DINOv2 to further boost generalization, enabling a single feature capable of matching anything. Extensive experiments validate that MATCHA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across geometric, semantic, and temporal matching tasks, setting a new foundation for a unified approach for the fundamental correspondence problem in computer vision. To the best of our knowledge, MATCHA is the first approach that is able to effectively tackle diverse matching tasks with a single unified feature.</p></details> |  |

Existing works focus on the bottleneck layer (h-space) of Stable Diffusion's U-Net or leverage the cross-attention, self-attention, or decoding layers. Our model, SkipInject takes advantage of U-Net's skip connections. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our methods state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined context consistency, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent context consistency, we propose a novel training-free method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed "One-Prompt-One-Story" (1Prompt1Story). Our approach 1Prompt1Story concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: Singular-Value Reweighting and Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we review recent advances in DMAD research. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis.

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

However, control-to-image generation, akin to ControlNet, remains largely unexplored within AR models. Although a natural approach, inspired by advancements in Large Language Models, is to tokenize control images into tokens and prefill them into the autoregressive model before decoding image tokens, it still falls short in generation quality compared to ControlNet and suffers from inefficiency. To this end, we introduce ControlAR, an efficient and effective framework for integrating spatial controls into autoregressive image generation models. Firstly, we explore control encoding for AR models and propose a lightweight control encoder to transform spatial inputs (e.g., canny edges or depth maps) into control tokens. Then ControlAR exploits the conditional decoding method to generate the next image token conditioned on the per-token fusion between control and image tokens, similar to positional encodings. Compared to prefilling tokens, using conditional decoding significantly strengthens the control capability of AR models but also maintains the model's efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed ControlAR surprisingly empowers AR models with arbitrary-resolution image generation via conditional decoding and specific controls. Extensive experiments can demonstrate the controllability of the proposed ControlAR for the autoregressive control-to-image generation across diverse inputs, including edges, depths, and segmentation masks. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that ControlAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art controllable diffusion models, e.g., ControlNet++.

As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.</p></details> |  |

Though there has been a plethora of algorithms proposed for personalized supervised learning, discovering the structure of local data through personalized unsupervised learning is less explored. We initiate a systematic study of such personalized unsupervised learning by developing algorithms based on optimization criteria inspired by a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework. We develop adaptive algorithms that discover the balance between using limited local data and collaborative information. We do this in the context of two unsupervised learning tasks: personalized dimensionality reduction and personalized diffusion models. We develop convergence analyses for our adaptive algorithms which illustrate the dependence on problem parameters (e.g., heterogeneity, local sample size). We also develop a theoretical framework for personalized diffusion models, which shows the benefits of collaboration even under heterogeneity. We finally evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effective sample amplification for personalized tasks, induced through collaboration, despite data heterogeneity.</p></details> |  |

However, all current generative approaches are limited to unfolding a fixed set of observables, making them unable to perform full-event unfolding in the variable dimensional environment of collider data. A novel modification to the variational latent diffusion model (VLD) approach to generative unfolding is presented, which allows for unfolding of high- and variable-dimensional feature spaces.

Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng.

However, the training of consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\times64$ datasets show that our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\times$ smaller networks.

In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs.

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

To address this limitation, in this work, we explore the integration of generative artificial intelligence techniques with physics-based simulators to enhance ADS system-level testing. Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing.</p></details> |  |

They are trained by denoising a Markovian process which gradually adds noise to the input. We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models. Through this unified framework, DART sets a new benchmark for scalable, high-quality image synthesis.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.</p></details> |  |

However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

However, performing non-rigid transformations, such as changing the pose of objects or image-based conditioning, remains challenging. Maintaining object identity during these edits is difficult, and current methods often fall short of the precision needed for industrial applications, where consistency is critical. Additionally, fine-tuning diffusion models requires custom training data, which is not always accessible in real-world scenarios. This work introduces FashionRepose, a training-free pipeline for non-rigid pose editing specifically designed for the fashion industry. The approach integrates off-the-shelf models to adjust poses of long-sleeve garments, maintaining identity and branding attributes. FashionRepose uses a zero-shot approach to perform these edits in near real-time, eliminating the need for specialized training. consistent image editing. The solution holds potential for applications in the fashion industry and other fields demanding identity preservation in image editing.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  |

Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\%.

To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D 1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D 1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 3D Generation</p></details> |

Existing methods for detecting AI-generated images primarily focus on specific forgery clues, which are often tailored to particular generative models like GANs or diffusion models. These approaches struggle to generalize across architectures. Building on the observation that generative images often exhibit local anomalies, such as excessive smoothness, blurred textures, and unnatural pixel variations in small regions, we propose the localized discrepancy representation network (LDR-Net), a novel approach for detecting AI-generated images. LDR-Net captures smoothing artifacts and texture irregularities, which are common but often overlooked. It integrates two complementary modules: local gradient autocorrelation (LGA) which models local smoothing anomalies to detect smoothing anomalies, and local variation pattern (LVP) which captures unnatural regularities by modeling the complexity of image patterns. By merging LGA and LVP features, a comprehensive representation of localized discrepancies can be provided. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting generated images and exhibits satisfactory generalization across unseen generative models. The code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |

However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |

However, the surge of data traffic brought by intelligent applications puts pressure on the resource utilization and energy consumption of the future networks. With efficient content understanding capabilities, semantic communication holds significant potential for reducing data transmission in intelligent applications. In this article, resource allocation driven by large models in semantic-aware networks is investigated. Specifically, a semantic-aware communication network architecture based on scene graph models and multimodal pre-trained models is designed to achieve efficient data transmission. On the basis of the proposed network architecture, an intelligent resource allocation scheme in semantic-aware network is proposed to further enhance resource utilization efficiency. In the resource allocation scheme, the semantic transmission quality is adopted as an evaluation metric and the impact of wireless channel fading on semantic transmission is analyzed. To maximize the semantic transmission quality for multiple users, a diffusion model-based decision-making scheme is designed to address the power allocation problem in semantic-aware networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed large-model-driven network architecture and resource allocation scheme achieve high-quality semantic transmission.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Reconstruction with Conditioned Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Brain MRIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04215v2)** | 2025-01-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2312.04215v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of supervised models to clinical screening tasks is challenging due to the need for annotated data for each considered pathology. Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is an alternative approach that aims to identify any anomaly as an outlier from a healthy training distribution. A prevalent strategy for UAD in brain MRI involves using generative models to learn the reconstruction of healthy brain anatomy for a given input image. As these models should fail to reconstruct unhealthy structures, the reconstruction errors indicate anomalies. However, a significant challenge is to balance the accurate reconstruction of healthy anatomy and the undesired replication of abnormal structures. While diffusion models have shown promising results with detailed and accurate reconstructions, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics, resulting in false positives. We propose conditioning the denoising process of diffusion models with additional information derived from a latent representation of the input image. We demonstrate that this conditioning allows for accurate and local adaptation to the general input intensity distribution while avoiding the replication of unhealthy structures. We compare the novel approach to different state-of-the-art methods and for different data sets. Our results show substantial improvements in the segmentation performance, with the Dice score improved by 11.9%, 20.0%, and 44.6%, for the BraTS, ATLAS and MSLUB data sets, respectively, while maintaining competitive performance on the WMH data set. Furthermore, our results indicate effective domain adaptation across different MRI acquisitions and simulated contrasts, an important attribute for general anomaly detection methods.

Our study further reveals that the monotonic fall phase of Kullback-Leibler divergence begins when the training dataset size reaches the dimension of the data points. Along the way, we provide a mathematically precise definition of memorization to non-memorization transition when only finite number of data points are available. It is shown that the simplified model also features this transition during the monotonic fall phase of the aforementioned Kullback-Leibler divergence. For large-scale practical diffusion models, we explain why higher number of diffusion steps enhance production quality based on the theoretical arguments presented before. In addition, we show that higher diffusion steps does not necessarily help in reducing memorization. These two facts combined suggests existence of an optimal number of diffusion steps for finite number of training samples.</p></details> | 31 pages |

It has been shown that additional visual cues can further improve performance. Given that speech communication involves audio, visual, and linguistic modalities, it is natural to expect another performance boost by incorporating linguistic information. However, bridging the modality gaps to efficiently incorporate linguistic information, along with audio and visual modalities during knowledge transfer, is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modality learning framework for SE. In the model framework, a state-of-the-art diffusion Model backbone is utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE) modeling where both audio and visual information are directly captured by microphones and video cameras. Based on this AVSE, the linguistic modality employs a PLM to transfer linguistic knowledge to the visual acoustic modality through a process termed Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer (CMKT) during AVSE model training. After the model is trained, it is supposed that linguistic knowledge is encoded in the feature processing of the AVSE model by the CMKT, and the PLM will not be involved during inference stage. We carry out SE experiments to evaluate the proposed model framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed AVSE system significantly enhances speech quality and reduces generative artifacts, such as phonetic confusion compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our visualization results demonstrate that our Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer method further improves the generated speech quality of our AVSE system. These findings not only suggest that Diffusion Model-based techniques hold promise for advancing the state-of-the-art in AVSE but also justify the effectiveness of incorporating linguistic information to improve the performance of Diffusion-based AVSE systems.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional diffusion models directly denoise the entire image from noisy inputs, disregarding the hierarchical structure present in visual signals. This method is computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution image generation. Signal processing often leverages hierarchical decompositions; for instance, Fourier analysis decomposes signals by frequency, while wavelet analysis captures localized frequency components, reflecting both spatial and frequency information simultaneously. Inspired by these principles, we propose a multiscale diffusion framework that generates hierarchical visual representations, which are subsequently integrated to form the final output. The diffusion model target, whether raw RGB pixels or latent features from a Variational Autoencoder, s divided into multiple components that each capture distinct spatial levels. The low-resolution component contains the primary informative signal, while higher-resolution components add high-frequency details, such as texture. This approach divides image generation into two stages: producing a low-resolution base signal, followed by a high-resolution residual signal. Both stages can be effectively modeled using simpler, lightweight transformer architectures compared to full-resolution generation. This decomposition is conceptually similar to wavelet decomposition but offers a more streamlined and intuitive design. Our method, termed MSF(short for Multi-Scale Factorization), achieves an FID of 2.2 and an IS of 255.4 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, reducing computational costs by 50% compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their training generally requires huge computational resources and large-scale datasets. To solve these, recent studies empower DMs with the advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique and propose retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). By incorporating rich knowledge from an auxiliary database, RAG enhances diffusion models' generation and generalization ability while significantly reducing model parameters. Despite the great success, RAG may introduce novel security issues that warrant further investigation. In this paper, we reveal that the RDM is susceptible to backdoor attacks by proposing a multimodal contrastive attack approach named BadRDM. Our framework fully considers RAG's characteristics and is devised to manipulate the retrieved items for given text triggers, thereby further controlling the generated contents. Specifically, we first insert a tiny portion of images into the retrieval database as target toxicity surrogates. Subsequently, a malicious variant of contrastive learning is adopted to inject backdoors into the retriever, which builds shortcuts from triggers to the toxicity surrogates. Furthermore, we enhance the attacks through novel entropy-based selection and generative augmentation strategies that can derive better toxicity surrogates. Extensive experiments on two mainstream tasks demonstrate the proposed BadRDM achieves outstanding attack effects while preserving the model's benign utility.</p></details> |  |

However, adversarial training necessitates additional training, while adversarial purification suffers from low time efficiency. More critically, current defenses are designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against the recently proposed unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient adversarial defense method that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our defense is inspired by the observation that adversarial attacks are typically located near the decision boundary and are sensitive to pixel changes. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing to mitigate adversarial modifications. Additionally, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly recover images. These approaches do not require additional training and are computationally efficient without calculating gradients. Extensive experiments against both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks demonstrate that our defense method outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

This paper introduces \textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables.

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture.

Due to combinatorial complexity, observing all combinations of basic elements in the training set is infeasible, which leads to an essential yet understudied problem of zero-shot generalization to states that are unseen combinations of previously seen elements. In this work, we first formalize this problem and then demonstrate how existing value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle due to unreliable value predictions in unseen states. We argue that this problem cannot be addressed with exploration alone, but requires more expressive and generalizable models. We demonstrate that behavior cloning with a conditioned diffusion model trained on expert trajectory generalizes better to states formed by new combinations of seen elements than traditional RL methods. Through experiments in maze, driving, and multiagent environments, we show that conditioned diffusion models outperform traditional RL techniques and highlight the broad applicability of our problem formulation.</p></details> |  |

To this end, randomized smoothing provides theoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial perturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for randomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making predictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small perturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a significant computational overhead during inference compared to classical methods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the diffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent space. Specifically, we use instance discrimination to achieve consistent representations along the trajectories by aligning temporally adjacent points. After fine-tuning based on the learned representations, our model enables implicit denoising-then-classification via a single prediction, substantially reducing inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during inference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of diffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on average, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by 85$\times$ on average.

Trained on large datasets, they capture expressive image priors that have been used for tasks like inpainting, depth, and (surface) normal prediction. However, these models are typically trained for one specific task, e.g., a separate model for each of color, depth, and normal prediction. Such models do not leverage the intrinsic correlation between appearance and geometry, often leading to inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose using a novel image diffusion prior that jointly encodes appearance and geometry. We introduce a diffusion model Orchid, comprising a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode color, depth, and surface normals to a latent space, and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for generating these joint latents. Orchid directly generates photo-realistic color images, relative depth, and surface normals from user-provided text, and can be used to create image-aligned partial 3D scenes seamlessly. It can also perform image-conditioned tasks like joint monocular depth and normal prediction and is competitive in accuracy to state-of-the-art methods designed for those tasks alone. Lastly, our model learns a joint prior that can be used zero-shot as a regularizer for many inverse problems that entangle appearance and geometry. For example, we demonstrate its effectiveness in color-depth-normal inpainting, showcasing its applicability to problems in 3D generation from sparse views.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://orchid3d.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Robust Body Composition Analysis by Generating 3D CT Volumes from Limited 2D Slices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13071v1)** | 2025-01-22 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13071v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Body composition analysis provides valuable insights into aging, disease progression, and overall health conditions. Due to concerns of radiation exposure, two-dimensional (2D) single-slice computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used repeatedly for body composition analysis. However, this approach introduces significant spatial variability that can impact the accuracy and robustness of the analysis. To mitigate this issue and facilitate body composition analysis, this paper presents a novel method to generate 3D CT volumes from limited number of 2D slices using a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our approach first maps 2D slices into a latent representation space using a variational autoencoder. An LDM is then trained to capture the 3D context of a stack of these latent representations. To accurately interpolate intermediateslices and construct a full 3D volume, we utilize body part regression to determine the spatial location and distance between the acquired slices. Experiments on both in-house and public 3D abdominal CT datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances body composition analysis compared to traditional 2D-based analysis, with a reduced error rate from 23.3% to 15.2%.</p></details> |  |

However, most research chest CT imaging is focused solely on the lungs due to considerations of cost and radiation dose. This restricted field of view (FOV) in the acquired images poses challenges to comprehensive analysis and hinders the ability to gain insights into the impact of lung diseases on other organs. To address this, we propose SCOPE (Spatial Coverage Optimization with Prior Encoding), a novel approach to capture the inter-organ relationships from CT images and extend the FOV of chest CT images. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode 2D axial CT slices individually, then stacks the latent representations of the VAE to form a 3D context for training a latent diffusion model. Once trained, our approach extends the FOV of CT images in the z-direction by generating new axial slices in a zero-shot manner. We evaluated our approach on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset, and results suggest that it effectively extends the FOV to include the liver and kidneys, which are not completely covered in the original NLST data acquisition. Quantitative results on a held-out whole-body dataset demonstrate that the generated slices exhibit high fidelity with acquired data, achieving an SSIM of 0.81.</p></details> |  |

Depending on the use case, model performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However, estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical because it requires retraining on many training data subsets corresponding to different contributors and rerunning inference. We introduce a method to efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks. Our results empirically demonstrate that our framework can identify important data contributors across models' global properties, outperforming existing attribution methods for diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at https://vismin.net/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024.

Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. Moreover, we show that with careful coefficient design, the convergence rate improves to $O(k/T)$, where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target data distribution. This highlights the ability of DDPM to automatically adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures, a common feature of natural image distributions. These results are achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process.</p></details> | <details><summary>add n...</summary><p>add new results demonstrating the adaptivity of the DDPM sampler to unknown low-dimensional structures</p></details> |

Focusing on two mainstream samplers -- the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) -- and assuming accurate score estimates, we prove that their iteration complexities are no greater than the order of $k/\varepsilon$ (up to some log factor), where $\varepsilon$ is the precision in total variation distance and $k$ is some intrinsic dimension of the target distribution. Our results are applicable to a broad family of target distributions without requiring smoothness or log-concavity assumptions. Further, we develop a lower bound that suggests the (near) necessity of the coefficients introduced by Ho et al.(2020) and Song et al.(2020) in facilitating low-dimensional adaptation. Our findings provide the first rigorous evidence for the adaptivity of the DDIM-type samplers to unknown low-dimensional structure, and improve over the state-of-the-art DDPM theory regarding total variation convergence.</p></details> |  |

Previous motion diffusion models lack explicit modeling of the word-level text-motion correspondence and good explainability, hence restricting their fine-grained editing ability. To address this issue, we propose an attention-based motion diffusion model, namely MotionCLR, with CLeaR modeling of attention mechanisms. Technically, MotionCLR models the in-modality and cross-modality interactions with self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. More specifically, the self-attention mechanism aims to measure the sequential similarity between frames and impacts the order of motion features. By contrast, the cross-attention mechanism works to find the fine-grained word-sequence correspondence and activate the corresponding timesteps in the motion sequence. Based on these key properties, we develop a versatile set of simple yet effective motion editing methods via manipulating attention maps, such as motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, and example-based motion generation, etc. For further verification of the explainability of the attention mechanism, we additionally explore the potential of action-counting and grounded motion generation ability via attention maps. Our experimental results show that our method enjoys good generation and editing ability with good explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated MotionCLR technical report</p></details> |

Previous methods encountered challenges in concurrently handling static editing and dynamic generation, while also struggling to achieve fidelity in object appearance and scene lighting. In this work, we introduce \textbf{OMG3D}, a novel framework that integrates the precise geometric control with the generative power of diffusion models, thus achieving significant enhancements in visual performance. Our framework first converts 2D objects into 3D, enabling user-directed modifications and lifelike motions at the geometric level. To address texture realism, we propose CustomRefiner, a texture refinement module that pre-train a customized diffusion model, aligning the details and style of coarse renderings of 3D rough model with the original image, further refine the texture. Additionally, we introduce IllumiCombiner, a lighting processing module that estimates and corrects background lighting to match human visual perception, resulting in more realistic shadow effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding visual performance of our approach in both static and dynamic scenarios. Remarkably, all these steps can be done using one NVIDIA 3090.

This systematic review, following PRISMA guidelines and using the PICO model, comprehensively evaluates the literature from 2014 to 2024 on the generation of sCT images for radiation therapy planning in oncology. A total of 35 relevant studies were identified and analyzed, revealing the prevalence of deep learning approaches in the generation of sCT. This review comprehensively covers synthetic CT generation based on CBCT and proton-based studies. Some of the commonly employed architectures explored are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), transformers, and diffusion models. Evaluation metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) consistently demonstrate the comparability of sCT images with gold-standard planning CTs (pCT), indicating their potential to improve treatment precision and patient outcomes. Challenges such as field-of-view (FOV) disparities and integration into clinical workflows are discussed, along with recommendations for future research and standardization efforts. In general, the findings underscore the promising role of sCT-based approaches in personalized treatment planning and adaptive radiation therapy, with potential implications for improved oncology treatment delivery and patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 Figures, Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences</p></details> |

Traditional segmentation methods often struggle to accurately locate such cracks, leading to inefficiencies in maintenance and repair processes. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based model with a cross-conditional encoder-decoder, named CrossDiff, which is the first to introduce the diffusion probabilistic model for the crack segmentation task. Specifically, CrossDiff integrates a cross-encoder and a cross-decoder into the diffusion model to constitute a cross-shaped diffusion model structure. The cross-encoder enhances the ability to retain crack details and the cross-decoder helps extract the semantic features of cracks. As a result, CrossDiff can better handle slender cracks. Extensive experiments were conducted on five challenging crack datasets including CFD, CrackTree200, DeepCrack, GAPs384, and Rissbilder. The results demonstrate that the proposed CrossDiff model achieves impressive performance, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods by 8.0% in terms of both Dice score and IoU. The code will be open-source soon.</p></details> |  |

However, missing MR modalities pose significant challenges for tasks like brain tumor segmentation, especially in deep learning-based segmentation, as each modality provides complementary information crucial for improving accuracy. A promising solution is missing data imputation, where absent modalities are generated from available ones. While generative models have been widely used for this purpose, most state-of-the-art approaches are limited to single or dual target translations, lacking the adaptability to generate missing modalities based on varying input configurations. To address this, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Modality Diffusion Network (AMM-Diff), a novel diffusion-based generative model capable of handling any number of input modalities and generating the missing ones. We designed an Image-Frequency Fusion Network (IFFN) that learns a unified feature representation through a self-supervised pretext task across the full input modalities and their selected high-frequency Fourier components. The proposed diffusion model leverages this representation, encapsulating prior knowledge of the complete modalities, and combines it with an adaptive reconstruction strategy to achieve missing modality completion. Experimental results on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Various guidance strategies have been introduced to steer the generative process toward outputs that are more likely to satisfy the planning objectives. These strategies avoid the need for model retraining but do not provide any guarantee that the generated outputs will satisfy the desired planning objectives. To address this limitation, we introduce certified guidance, an approach that modifies a generative model, without retraining it, into a new model guaranteed to satisfy a given specification with probability one. We focus on Signal Temporal Logic specifications, which are rich enough to describe nontrivial planning tasks. Our approach leverages neural network verification techniques to systematically explore the latent spaces of the generative models, identifying latent regions that are certifiably correct with respect to the STL property of interest. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on four planning benchmarks using GANs and diffusion models. Our results confirm that certified guidance produces generative models that are always correct, unlike existing guidance methods that are not certified.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, accepted at AAMAS 25 conference</p></details> |

However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images. On the other hand, the internet hosts vast instructional videos (e.g., online geometry courses) that are widely used by humans to learn foundational subjects, yet these valuable resources remain underexplored in VLM training. In this paper, we introduce a high-quality \textbf{multimodal textbook} corpus with richer foundational knowledge for VLM pretraining. It collects over 2.5 years of instructional videos, totaling 22,000 class hours. We first use an LLM-proposed taxonomy to systematically gather instructional videos. Then we progressively extract and refine visual (keyframes), audio (ASR), and textual knowledge (OCR) from the videos, and organize as an image-text interleaved corpus based on temporal order. Compared to its counterparts, our video-centric textbook offers more coherent context, richer knowledge, and better image-text alignment. Experiments demonstrate its superb pretraining performance, particularly in knowledge- and reasoning-intensive tasks like ScienceQA and MathVista. Moreover, VLMs pre-trained on our textbook exhibit outstanding interleaved context awareness, leveraging visual and textual cues in their few-shot context for task solving. Our code are available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multimodal_textbook.</p></details> | Under review |

Unsupervised segmentation is promising to avoid human annotations while the performance is often limited. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised segmentation approach that leverages the capabilities of foundation models, and it consists of three main steps: (1) A vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) is employed to obtain image-level pseudo-labels for training a classification network. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is then employed to extract Regions of Interest (ROIs), where an adaptive masking-based data augmentation is used to enhance ROI identification.(2) The ROIs are used to generate bounding box and point prompts for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain segmentation pseudo-labels. (3) A 3D segmentation network is trained with the SAM-derived pseudo-labels, where low-quality pseudo-labels are filtered out in a self-learning process based on the similarity between the SAM's output and the network's prediction. Evaluation on the BraTS2020 dataset demonstrates that our approach obtained an average Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 85.60%, outperforming five state-of-the-art unsupervised segmentation methods by more than 10 percentage points. Besides, our approach outperforms directly using SAM for zero-shot inference, and its performance is close to fully supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>22st ...</summary><p>22st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025)</p></details> |

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  |

This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the use of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs to align visual and textual features, for acquiring fine-grained and domain-invariant representations in generalizable person re-identification. The adaptation of CLIP to the task presents two primary challenges: learning more fine-grained features to enhance discriminative ability, and learning more domain-invariant features to improve the model's generalization capabilities. To mitigate the first challenge thereby enhance the ability to learn fine-grained features, a three-stage strategy is proposed to boost the accuracy of text descriptions. Initially, the image encoder is trained to effectively adapt to person re-identification tasks. In the second stage, the features extracted by the image encoder are used to generate textual descriptions (i.e., prompts) for each image. Finally, the text encoder with the learned prompts is employed to guide the training of the final image encoder. To enhance the model's generalization capabilities to unseen domains, a bidirectional guiding method is introduced to learn domain-invariant image features. Specifically, domain-invariant and domain-relevant prompts are generated, and both positive (pulling together image features and domain-invariant prompts) and negative (pushing apart image features and domain-relevant prompts) views are used to train the image encoder. Collectively, these strategies contribute to the development of an innovative CLIP-based framework for learning fine-grained generalized features in person re-identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TIFS</p></details> |

We first introduce a method for detecting driver reactions through speed and sound anomaly detection, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. For hazard detection, we employ a set of heuristic rules as weak classifiers, which are combined using an ensemble method. This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards. Our method achieved the highest scores in the Challenge on Out-of-Label in Autonomous Driving, demonstrating its effectiveness across all three tasks.

Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

However, the reality is that current LVLMs (Large Vision Language Models) can hardly even accurately copy a geometric figure, let alone truly understand the complex inherent logic and spatial relationships within geometric shapes. We believe accurate copying (strong perception) is the first step to visual o1. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of "slow perception" (SP), which guides the model to gradually perceive basic point-line combinations, as our humans, reconstruct complex geometric structures progressively. There are two-fold stages in SP: a) perception decomposition. Perception is not instantaneous. In this stage, complex geometric figures are broken down into basic simple units to unify geometry representation. b) perception flow, which acknowledges that accurately tracing a line is not an easy task. This stage aims to avoid "long visual jumps" in regressing line segments by using a proposed "perceptual ruler" to trace each line stroke-by-stroke. Surprisingly, such a human-like perception manner enjoys an inference time scaling law -- the slower, the better. Researchers strive to speed up the model's perception in the past, but we slow it down again, allowing the model to read the image step-by-step and carefully.</p></details> |  |

Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing unsupervised methods for maritime object classification often struggle with the long-tail data distributions in both object categories and weather conditions. In this paper, we construct a dataset named AIMO produced by large-scale generative models with diverse weather conditions and balanced object categories, and collect a dataset named RMO with real-world images where long-tail issue exists. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach that leverages AIMO (source domain) to address the problem of limited labeled data, unbalanced distribution and domain shift in RMO (target domain), and enhance the generalization of source features with the Vision-Language Models such as CLIP. Experimental results shows that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracy, particularly for samples within rare object categories and weather conditions.

While significant progress has been made in text and meme modalities, video-based hate speech detection remains under-explored, hindered by a lack of annotated datasets and the high cost of video annotation. This gap is particularly problematic given the growing reliance on large models, which demand substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, we leverage meme datasets as both a substitution and an augmentation strategy for training hateful video detection models. Our approach introduces a human-assisted reannotation pipeline to align meme dataset labels with video datasets, ensuring consistency with minimal labeling effort. Using two state-of-the-art vision-language models, we demonstrate that meme data can substitute for video data in resource-scarce scenarios and augment video datasets to achieve further performance gains.

However, scientific data often exists in both visual and textual modalities. Vision language models (VLMs) address this by incorporating a pretrained vision backbone for processing images and a cross-modal projector that adapts image tokens into the LLM dimensional space, thereby providing richer multimodal comprehension. Nevertheless, off-the-shelf VLMs show limited capabilities in handling domain-specific data and are prone to hallucinations. We developed intelligent assistants finetuned from LLaVA models to enhance multimodal understanding in low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT)-a benign approach used in the treatment of cancer-related illnesses. Using multilingual data from 42,673 articles, we devise complex reasoning and detailed description tasks for visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks.

Early research in this area was primarily based on horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), but as more diverse RS datasets have become available, tasks involving oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and segmentation masks have emerged. In practical applications, different targets require different grounding types: HBB can localize an object's position, OBB provides its orientation, and mask depicts its shape. However, existing specialized methods are typically tailored to a single type of RS visual grounding task and are hard to generalize across tasks. In contrast, large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit powerful multi-task learning capabilities but struggle to handle dense prediction tasks like segmentation. This paper proposes GeoGround, a novel framework that unifies support for HBB, OBB, and mask RS visual grounding tasks, allowing flexible output selection. Rather than customizing the architecture of VLM, our work aims to elegantly support pixel-level visual grounding output through the Text-Mask technique. We define prompt-assisted and geometry-guided learning to enhance consistency across different signals. To support model training, we present refGeo, a large-scale RS visual instruction-following dataset containing 161k image-text pairs. Experimental results show that GeoGround demonstrates strong performance across four RS visual grounding tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks.

We fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs (2B-8B parameters) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and validate them on multiple out-of-domain (OD) scenarios from our proposed benchmark. Our findings reveal that coherent sentence-based outputs outperform tuple formats, particularly in OD scenarios with large domain gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate that scaling numeric tokens during loss computation enhances numerical approximation capabilities, further improving performance on spatial and measurement tasks. These results highlight the importance of output format design, loss scaling strategies, and robust generalization techniques in enhancing the training and fine-tuning of VLMs, particularly for tasks requiring precise spatial approximations and strong OD generalization.</p></details> | 8 Pages |

An important type is object hallucination, where LVLMs generate objects that are inconsistent with the images shown to the model. Existing works typically attempt to quantify object hallucinations by detecting and measuring the fraction of hallucinated objects in generated captions. Additionally, more recent work also measures object hallucinations by directly querying the LVLM with binary questions about the presence of likely hallucinated objects based on object statistics like top-k frequent objects and top-k co-occurring objects. In this paper, we present Context-Aware Object Similarities (CAOS), a novel approach for evaluating object hallucination in LVLMs using object statistics as well as the generated captions. CAOS uniquely integrates object statistics with semantic relationships between objects in captions and ground-truth data. Moreover, existing approaches usually only detect and measure hallucinations belonging to a predetermined set of in-domain objects (typically the set of all ground-truth objects for the training dataset) and ignore generated objects that are not part of this set, leading to under-evaluation. To address this, we further employ language model--based object recognition to detect potentially out-of-domain hallucinated objects and use an ensemble of LVLMs for verifying the presence of such objects in the query image. CAOS also examines the sequential dynamics of object generation, shedding light on how the order of object appearance influences hallucinations, and employs word embedding models to analyze the semantic reasons behind hallucinations. CAOS aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the hallucination tendencies of LVLMs by providing a systematic framework to identify and interpret object hallucinations.</p></details> |  |

For downstream few shot classification tasks, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) VLM has gained much popularity in the computer vision community. PEFT methods like prompt tuning and linear adapter have been studied for fine-tuning VLM while low rank adaptation (LoRA) algorithm has rarely been considered for few shot fine-tuning VLM. The main obstacle to use LoRA for few shot fine-tuning is the catastrophic forgetting problem. Because the visual language alignment knowledge is important for the generality in few shot learning, whereas low rank adaptation interferes with the most informative direction of the pretrained weight matrix. We propose the complementary subspace low rank adaptation (Comp-LoRA) method to regularize the catastrophic forgetting problem in few shot VLM finetuning. In detail, we optimize the low rank matrix in the complementary subspace, thus preserving the general vision language alignment ability of VLM when learning the novel few shot information. We conduct comparison experiments of the proposed Comp-LoRA method and other PEFT methods on fine-tuning VLM for few shot classification. And we also present the suppression on the catastrophic forgetting problem of our proposed method against directly applying LoRA to VLM. The results show that the proposed method surpasses the baseline method by about +1.0\% Top-1 accuracy and preserves the VLM zero-shot performance over the baseline method by about +1.3\% Top-1 accuracy.</p></details> | Preprint version |

We investigate the impact of fine-tuning VLMs on VTT datasets to enhance description accuracy, contextual relevance, and linguistic consistency. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning substantially improves the model's ability to produce more detailed and domain-aligned text, bridging the gap between generic VLM tasks and the specialized needs of VTT. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model outperforms baseline VLMs across various evaluation metrics, underscoring the importance of domain-specific tuning for complex VTT tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, excessively long multimodal inputs lead to oversized Key-Value (KV) caches, resulting in significant memory consumption and I/O bottlenecks. Previous KV quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) may alleviate these issues but overlook the attention saliency differences of multimodal tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we investigate the attention-aware token saliency patterns in VLM and propose AKVQ-VL. AKVQ-VL leverages the proposed Text-Salient Attention (TSA) and Pivot-Token-Salient Attention (PSA) patterns to adaptively allocate bit budgets. Moreover, achieving extremely low-bit quantization requires effectively addressing outliers in KV tensors. AKVQ-VL utilizes the Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) to construct outlier-free KV caches, thereby reducing quantization difficulty. Evaluations of 2-bit quantization on 12 long-context and multimodal tasks demonstrate that AKVQ-VL maintains or even improves accuracy, outperforming LLM-oriented methods. AKVQ-VL can reduce peak memory usage by 2.13x, support up to 3.25x larger batch sizes and 2.46x throughput.</p></details> |  |

Diagrams are a typical example of a visual language depicting complex concepts and their relationships in the form of an image. The symbolic nature of diagrams presents significant challenges for building models capable of understanding them. Recent studies suggest that Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can even tackle complex reasoning tasks involving diagrams. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by developing a comprehensive test suite to evaluate the diagram comprehension capability of LVLMs. Our test suite uses a variety of questions focused on concept entities and their relationships over a set of synthetic as well as real diagrams across domains to evaluate the recognition and reasoning abilities of models. Our evaluation of LVLMs shows that while they can accurately identify and reason about entities, their ability to understand relationships is notably limited. Further testing reveals that the decent performance on diagram understanding largely stems from leveraging their background knowledge as shortcuts to identify and reason about the relational information. Thus, we conclude that LVLMs have a limited capability for genuine diagram understanding, and their impressive performance in diagram reasoning is an illusion emanating from other confounding factors, such as the background knowledge in the models.</p></details> |  |

In brief, our method uses self-supervised fine-tuning and relies on a point-wise (MI) estimation between prompts and images to create a synthetic fine-tuning set for improving model alignment. Our analysis indicates that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art, yet it only requires the pre-trained denoising network of the T2I model itself to estimate MI, and a simple fine-tuning strategy that improves alignment while maintaining image quality.</p></details> | to appear at ICLR25 |

Given an arbitrary set of textual queries, image pixels are assigned the closest query in feature space. However, this works well when a user exhaustively lists all possible visual concepts in an image, which contrast against each other for the assignment. This corresponds to the current evaluation setup in the literature which relies on having access to a list of in-domain relevant concepts, typically classes of a benchmark dataset. Here, we consider the more challenging (and realistic) scenario of segmenting a single concept, given a textual prompt and nothing else. To achieve good results, besides contrasting with the generic $\textit{background}$ text, we propose two different approaches to automatically generate, at test time, textual contrastive concepts that are query-specific. We do so by leveraging the distribution of text in the VLM's training set or crafted LLM prompts. We also propose a metric designed to evaluate this scenario and show the relevance of our approach to commonly used datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, adoption in remote sensing remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of paired image-text data. To bridge this gap, synthetic caption generation has gained interest, traditionally relying on rule-based methods that use metadata or bounding boxes. While these approaches provide some description, they often lack the depth needed to capture complex wide-area scenes. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for generating more descriptive captions, yet they can produce generic outputs and are prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose a new method to enhance vision-language datasets for remote sensing by integrating maps as external data sources, enabling the generation of detailed, context-rich captions. Additionally, we present methods to measure and mitigate hallucinations in LLM-generated text. We introduce fMoW-mm, a multimodal dataset incorporating satellite imagery, maps, metadata, and text annotations. We demonstrate its effectiveness for automatic target recognition in few-shot settings, achieving superior performance compared to other vision-language remote sensing datasets.</p></details> |  |

For example, K-12 educators using digital learning platforms may need to examine and provide feedback across many images of students' math work. To assess the potential of VLMs to support educators in settings like this one, we introduce DrawEduMath, an English-language dataset of 2,030 images of students' handwritten responses to K-12 math problems. Teachers provided detailed annotations, including free-form descriptions of each image and 11,661 question-answer (QA) pairs. These annotations capture a wealth of pedagogical insights, ranging from students' problem-solving strategies to the composition of their drawings, diagrams, and writing. We evaluate VLMs on teachers' QA pairs, as well as 44,362 synthetic QA pairs derived from teachers' descriptions using language models (LMs). We show that even state-of-the-art VLMs leave much room for improvement on DrawEduMath questions. We also find that synthetic QAs, though imperfect, can yield similar model rankings as teacher-written QAs.

However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations.

However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation.

In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 24 advanced open-source LVLMs and 2 close-source LVLMs are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released at \url{https://github.com/Robin-WZQ/Dysca}.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Analyzing Model Size, Data Composition, and Multilinguality in Vision-Language Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13223v2)** | 2025-01-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13223v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large scale vision language models become increasingly central to modern AI applications, understanding and mitigating social biases in these systems has never been more critical. We investigate how dataset composition, model size, and multilingual training affect gender and racial bias in a popular VLM, CLIP, and its open source variants. In particular, we systematically evaluate models trained on varying dataset scales and architectures, as well as multilingual versions encompassing English along with Persian, Turkish, and Finnish,languages with minimal gender marking. To assess social perception bias, we measure the zero-shot performance on face images featuring socially charged terms rooted in the psychological constructs of communion and agency, and demographic labeling bias using both the FairFace and PATA datasets. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, while larger training datasets can mitigate some biases, they may also introduce or amplify others when the data composition is imbalanced. Second, although increasing model size generally improves performance, it does not consistently reduce bias and can, in certain cases, exacerbate it. Finally, while multilingual training broadens linguistic coverage, it does not inherently neutralize bias and can transfer or intensify inequities across languages. Taken together, these results highlight the necessity of inclusive, carefully curated training data to foster fairness rather than relying solely on model scaling or language expansion. We provide a systematic evaluation for vision language bias across diverse demographics, underscoring the urgent need for intentional bias mitigation strategies in next-generation AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing partitioning methods uniformly process sub-images, resulting in suboptimal image understanding. In this work, we reveal that the sub-images with higher semantic relevance to the entire image encapsulate richer visual information for preserving the model's visual understanding ability. Therefore, we propose the Global Semantic-guided Weight Allocator (GSWA) module, which dynamically allocates weights to sub-images based on their relative information density, emulating human visual attention mechanisms. This approach enables the model to focus on more informative regions, overcoming the limitations of uniform treatment. We integrate GSWA into the InternVL2-2B framework to create SleighVL, a lightweight yet high-performing model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SleighVL outperforms models with comparable parameters and remains competitive with larger models. Our work provides a promising direction for more efficient and contextually aware high-resolution image processing in LVLMs, advancing multimodal system development.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures and tables</p></details> |

Tarsier2 achieves significant advancements through three key upgrades: (1) Scaling pre-training data from 11M to 40M video-text pairs, enriching both volume and diversity; (2) Performing fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning; (3) Using model-based sampling to automatically construct preference data and applying DPO training for optimization. Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8% over GPT-4o and 5.8% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods like FASTV and VTW have achieved notable results in reducing redundant visual tokens, but these approaches focus on pruning tokens in a single forward pass without systematically analyzing the redundancy of visual tokens throughout the entire generation process. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy tailored for VLMs, namedDynamic Rate (DyRate), which progressively adjusts the compression rate during generation. Our analysis of the distribution of attention reveals that the importance of visual tokens decreases throughout the generation process, inspiring us to adopt a more aggressive compression rate. By integrating a lightweight predictor based on attention distribution, our approach enables flexible adjustment of pruning rates based on the attention distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational demands but also maintains the quality of responses.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for tuning VLMs in semi-supervised setups struggle with the negative impact of the miscalibrated VLMs on pseudo-labelling, and the accumulation of noisy pseudo-labels. SelfPrompt addresses these challenges by introducing a cluster-guided pseudo-labelling method that improves pseudo-label accuracy, and a confidence-aware semi-supervised learning module that maximizes the utilization of unlabelled data by combining supervised learning and weakly-supervised learning. Additionally, we investigate our method in an active semi-supervised learning setup, where the labelled set is strategically selected to ensure the best utilization of a limited labelling budget. To this end, we propose a weakly-supervised sampling technique that selects a diverse and representative labelled set, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods to enhance their performance. We conduct extensive evaluations across 13 datasets, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art performances with average improvements of 6.23% in standard semi-supervised learning, 6.25% in active semi-supervised learning, and 4.9% in base-to-novel generalization, using a 2-shot setup. Furthermore, SelfPrompt shows excellent generalization in single-shot settings, achieving an average improvement of 11.78%.</p></details> |  |

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 main conference track</p></details> |

Recent approaches have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align textual and visual modalities. These methods typically employ prompt engineering, parameter-tuning, and modality fusion to generate rich textual prototypes that serve as class prototypes for CZSL. However, the modality gap results in textual prototypes being unable to fully capture the optimal representations of all class prototypes, particularly those with fine-grained features, which can be directly obtained from the visual modality. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Prototype Joint Learning framework for the CZSL task. Our approach, based on VLMs, introduces prototypes in both the textual and visual modalities. The textual prototype is optimized to capture broad conceptual information, aiding the model's generalization across unseen compositions. Meanwhile, the visual prototype is used to mitigate the classification errors caused by the modality gap and capture fine-grained details to distinguish images with similar appearances. To effectively optimize these prototypes, we design specialized decomposition modules and a joint learning strategy that enrich the features from both modalities. These prototypes not only capture key category information during training but also serve as crucial reference targets during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the closed-world setting and competitive performance in the open-world setting across three publicly available CZSL benchmarks. These findings validate the effectiveness of our method in advancing compositional generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, these training-based methods are prone to domain shifts and require high computational costs, which hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, unlike previous works, we propose a training-Free Zero-shot temporal Action Detection (FreeZAD) method, leveraging existing vision-language (ViL) models to directly classify and localize unseen activities within untrimmed videos without any additional fine-tuning or adaptation. We mitigate the need for explicit temporal modeling and reliance on pseudo-label quality by designing the LOGarithmic decay weighted Outer-Inner-Contrastive Score (LogOIC) and frequency-based Actionness Calibration. Furthermore, we introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy using Prototype-Centric Sampling (PCS) to expand FreeZAD, enabling ViL models to adapt more effectively for ZSTAD. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods while requiring only 1/13 of the runtime. When equipped with TTA, the enhanced method further narrows the gap with fully supervised methods.</p></details> |  |

The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we assess the performance of VLMs on the challenging Bongard Openworld Problems benchmark, which involves reasoning over natural images. We propose and evaluate three human-inspired paradigms: holistic analysis (global context processing), deductive rule learning (explicit rule derivation and application), and componential analysis (structured decomposition of images into components). Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o and Gemini, not only surpass human benchmarks but also excel in structured reasoning tasks, with componential analysis proving especially effective. However, ablation studies reveal key challenges, such as handling synthetic images, making fine-grained distinctions, and interpreting nuanced contextual information. These insights underscore the need for further advancements in model robustness and generalization, while highlighting the transformative potential of structured reasoning approaches in enhancing VLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

While existing research has explored white-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box scenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for achieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across driving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD). It first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level reasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring the perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain. Building on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic adaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level risky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current driving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we validate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles powered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the vehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches. Finally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial visual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in this critical domain. Our codes and dataset will be available after paper's acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI-2025 as an oral presentation</p></details> |

Our approach enables the autonomous transport of dispersed particles through a series of shaping and pushing actions using robotically-controlled tools. Achieving this advanced manipulation capability presents two key challenges: high-level task planning and trajectory execution. For task planning, we leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable primitive actions such as tool affordance grasping and non-prehensile particle pushing. For trajectory execution, we represent the evolving particle aggregate's contour using truncated Fourier series, providing efficient parametrization of its closed shape. We adaptively compute trajectory waypoints based on group cohesion and the geometric centroid of the aggregate, accounting for its spatial distribution and collective motion. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in actively shaping and manipulating multi-particle aggregates while maintaining high system cohesion.</p></details> |  |

Running VLMs on edge devices has become a challenge for their widespread application. There are several efficient VLM efforts, but they often sacrifice linguistic capabilities to enhance multimodal abilities, or require extensive training. To address this quandary,we introduce the innovative framework of Efficient Vision Language Models with Elastic Visual Experts (Eve). By strategically incorporating adaptable visual expertise at multiple stages of training, Eve strikes a balance between preserving linguistic abilities and augmenting multimodal capabilities. This balanced approach results in a versatile model with only 1.8B parameters that delivers significant improvements in both multimodal and linguistic tasks. Notably, in configurations below 3B parameters, Eve distinctly outperforms in language benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art results 68.87% in VLM Benchmarks.

When applied to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), existing VR approaches follow the same pipeline used in vision models (e.g., ResNet, ViT), where ground-truth class labels are inserted into fixed text templates to guide the optimization of VR patterns. This label-based approach, however, overlooks the rich information and diverse attribute-guided textual representations that CLIP can exploit, which may lead to the misclassification of samples. In this paper, we propose Attribute-based Visual Reprogramming (AttrVR) for CLIP, utilizing descriptive attributes (DesAttrs) and distinctive attributes (DistAttrs), which respectively represent common and unique feature descriptions for different classes. Besides, as images of the same class may reflect different attributes after VR, AttrVR iteratively refines patterns using the $k$-nearest DesAttrs and DistAttrs for each image sample, enabling more dynamic and sample-specific optimization. Theoretically, AttrVR is shown to reduce intra-class variance and increase inter-class separation. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in 12 downstream tasks for both ViT-based and ResNet-based CLIP. The success of AttrVR facilitates more effective integration of VR from unimodal vision models into vision-language models.

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

This paper aims to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Although previous studies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversarial learning or test-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these works identifies two critical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when it is explicitly disclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotations during debiasing process. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome these limitations simultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasing method called SANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attribute information from CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions. Experimental results show that SANER, which does not require attribute annotations and preserves original information for attribute-specific descriptions, demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existing methods. Additionally, we observe that SANER does not require retraining CLIP from scratch with the original dataset. Moreover, the debiased model can be directly applied to the text-to-image generation model by simply replacing the text encoder.</p></details> |  |

This complexity and diversity in SGG leads to underrepresentation, where parts of triplet labels are rare or even unseen during training, resulting in imprecise predictions. To tackle this, we propose integrating the pretrained Vision-language Models to enhance representation. However, due to the gap between pretraining and SGG, direct inference of pretrained VLMs on SGG leads to severe bias, which stems from the imbalanced predicates distribution in the pretraining language set. To alleviate the bias, we introduce a novel LM Estimation to approximate the unattainable predicates distribution. Finally, we ensemble the debiased VLMs with SGG models to enhance the representation, where we design a certainty-aware indicator to score each sample and dynamically adjust the ensemble weights. Our training-free method effectively addresses the predicates bias in pretrained VLMs, enhances SGG's representation, and significantly improve the performance.</p></details> |  |

Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention. his separation of responsibilities setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions due to anchoring bias, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained. As a remedy, we introduce learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which - rather than taking control from the human expert - the machine provides guidance useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. In order to ensure guidance is interpretable} and task-specific, we develop SLOG, an approach for turning any vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback. Our empirical evaluation highlights the promise of \method on a challenging, real-world medical diagnosis task.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches have explored patent figure classification for only a single aspect and for aspects with a limited number of concepts. In recent years, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown tremendous performance across numerous computer vision downstream tasks, however, they remain unexplored for patent figure classification. Our work explores the efficacy of LVLMs in patent figure visual question answering (VQA) and classification, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. For this purpose, we introduce new datasets, PatFigVQA and PatFigCLS, for fine-tuning and evaluation regarding multiple aspects of patent figures~(i.e., type, projection, patent class, and objects). For a computational-effective handling of a large number of classes using LVLM, we propose a novel tournament-style classification strategy that leverages a series of multiple-choice questions. Experimental results and comparisons of multiple classification approaches based on LVLMs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in few-shot settings show the feasibility of the proposed approaches.</p></details> |  |

While hand-crafted or template-based prompts are generally applicable to a wider range of unseen classes, they tend to perform poorly in downstream tasks (i.e., seen classes). Learnable soft prompts, on the other hand, often perform well in downstream tasks but lack generalizability. Additionally, prior research has predominantly concentrated on the textual modality, with very few studies attempting to explore the prompt's generalization potential from the visual modality. Keeping these limitations in mind, we investigate how to prompt tuning to obtain both a competitive downstream performance and generalization. The study shows that by treating soft and hand-crafted prompts as dual views of the textual modality, and maximizing their mutual information, we can better ensemble task-specific and general semantic information. Moreover, to generate more expressive prompts, the study introduces a class-wise augmentation from the visual modality, resulting in significant robustness to a wider range of unseen classes. Extensive evaluations on several benchmarks report that the proposed approach achieves competitive results in terms of both task-specific performance and general abilities.</p></details> | in progress |

However, semantic structural visual hallucinations involving perceptually severe defects remain a concern, especially in the domain of non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) such as cartoons and pixelization-style character. To detect these hallucinations in NPR, We propose a novel semantic structural hallucination detection system using Vision-Language Model (VLM). Our approach is to leverage the emerging capability of large language model, in-context learning which denotes that VLM has seen some examples by user for specific downstream task, here hallucination detection. Based on in-context learning, we introduce pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) which improve the overall performance of VLM by further inputting visual data beyond prompts, RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. Within selected two VLMs, GPT-4v, Gemini pro vision, our proposed PA-ICVL improves the hallucination detection with 50% to 78%, 57% to 80%, respectively. This research advances a capability of TTI models toward real-world applications by mitigating visual hallucinations via in-context visual learning, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains. In addition, it showcase how users can boost the downstream-specialized capability of open VLM by harnessing additional conditions. We collect synthetic cartoon-hallucination dataset with TTI models, this dataset and final tuned VLM will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025, Project page: https://gh-bumsookim.github.io/Cartoon-Hallucinations-Detection/</p></details> |

Given their reliance on classification objectives, traditional WSOL methods like class activation mapping focus on the most discriminative object parts, often missing the full spatial extent. In contrast, recent WSOL methods based on vision-language models like CLIP require ground truth classes or external classifiers to produce a localization map, limiting their deployment in downstream tasks. Moreover, methods like GenPromp attempt to address these issues but introduce considerable complexity due to their reliance on conditional denoising processes and intricate prompt learning. This paper introduces Text Distillation for Localization (TeD-Loc), an approach that directly distills knowledge from CLIP text embeddings into the model backbone and produces patch-level localization. Multiple instance learning of these image patches allows for accurate localization and classification using one model without requiring external classifiers. Such integration of textual and visual modalities addresses the longstanding challenge of achieving accurate localization and classification concurrently, as WSOL methods in the literature typically converge at different epochs. Extensive experiments show that leveraging text embeddings and localization cues provides a cost-effective WSOL model. TeD-Loc improves Top-1 LOC accuracy over state-of-the-art models by about 5% on both CUB and ILSVRC datasets, while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to GenPromp.</p></details> |  |

However, improperly positioned or designed virtual content can be detrimental to task performance, as it can impair users' ability to accurately interpret real-world information. In this paper we examine two types of task-detrimental virtual content: obstruction attacks, in which virtual content prevents users from seeing real-world objects, and information manipulation attacks, in which virtual content interferes with users' ability to accurately interpret real-world information. We provide a mathematical framework to characterize these attacks and create a custom open-source dataset for attack evaluation. To address these attacks, we introduce ViDDAR (Vision language model-based Task-Detrimental content Detector for Augmented Reality), a comprehensive full-reference system that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and advanced deep learning techniques to monitor and evaluate virtual content in AR environments, employing a user-edge-cloud architecture to balance performance with low latency. To the best of our knowledge, ViDDAR is the first system to employ VLMs for detecting task-detrimental content in AR settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ViDDAR effectively understands complex scenes and detects task-detrimental content, achieving up to 92.15% obstruction detection accuracy with a detection latency of 533 ms, and an 82.46% information manipulation content detection accuracy with a latency of 9.62 s.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? Could Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a solution for the automated evaluation of AR-generated scenes? In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of three state-of-the-art commercial VLMs -- GPT, Gemini, and Claude -- in identifying and describing AR scenes. For this purpose, we use DiverseAR, the first AR dataset specifically designed to assess VLMs' ability to analyze virtual content across a wide range of AR scene complexities. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are generally capable of perceiving and describing AR scenes, achieving a True Positive Rate (TPR) of up to 93\% for perception and 71\% for description. While they excel at identifying obvious virtual objects, such as a glowing apple, they struggle when faced with seamlessly integrated content, such as a virtual pot with realistic shadows. Our results highlight both the strengths and the limitations of VLMs in understanding AR scenarios. We identify key factors affecting VLM performance, including virtual content placement, rendering quality, and physical plausibility. This study underscores the potential of VLMs as tools for evaluating the quality of AR experiences.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data.

However, the manual generation of unstructured medical reports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generated radiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate report generation. In this study we have evaluated different combinations of multimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the image encoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

However, these models frequently exhibit hallucination behavior, where they generate descriptions containing objects or details absent in the input image. Our work investigates this phenomenon by analyzing attention patterns across transformer layers and heads, revealing that hallucinations often stem from progressive degradation of visual grounding in deeper layers. We propose a novel attention modification approach that combines selective token emphasis and head-specific modulation to maintain visual grounding throughout the generation process. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a dual-stream token selection mechanism that identifies and prioritizes both locally informative and spatially significant visual tokens, and (2) an attention head-specific modulation strategy that differentially amplifies visual information processing based on measured visual sensitivity of individual attention heads. Through extensive experimentation on the MSCOCO dataset, we demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining comparable task performance. Our analysis reveals that selectively modulating tokens across attention heads with varying levels of visual sensitivity can significantly improve visual grounding without requiring model retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p></details> |  |

The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates how AI can improve game testing by developing and experimenting with an AI-assisted workflow that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models for defect detection. Through an experiment involving 800 test cases and 276 participants of varying backgrounds, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI assistance under four conditions: with or without AI support, and with or without detailed knowledge of defects and design documentation. The results indicate that AI assistance significantly improves defect identification performance, particularly when paired with detailed knowledge.

Existing methods often leverage language information from vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance OOD detection by improving confidence estimation through rich class-wise text information. However, when building OOD detection score upon on in-distribution (ID) text-image affinity, existing works either focus on each ID class or whole ID label sets, overlooking inherent ID classes' connection. We find that the semantic information across different ID classes is beneficial for effective OOD detection. We thus investigate the ability of image-text comprehension among different semantic-related ID labels in VLMs and propose a novel post-hoc strategy called SimLabel. SimLabel enhances the separability between ID and OOD samples by establishing a more robust image-class similarity metric that considers consistency over a set of similar class labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SimLabel on various zero-shot OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model is also extended to various VLM-backbones, demonstrating its good generalization ability.

The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in particular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to detect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context disinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document, neglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that are not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task of validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency~(LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news articles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting strategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images crawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of entity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results show the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification, showing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence images.

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

However, applying the CLIP inference in zero-shot classification, particularly for medical image diagnosis, faces challenges due to: 1) the inadequacy of representing image classes solely with single category names; 2) the modal gap between the visual and text spaces generated by CLIP encoders. Despite attempts to enrich disease descriptions with large language models, the lack of class-specific knowledge often leads to poor performance. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that existing proxy learning methods for zero-shot image classification on natural image datasets exhibit instability when applied to medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Knowledge Proxy Learning (KPL) to mine knowledge from CLIP. KPL is designed to leverage CLIP's multimodal understandings for medical image classification through Text Proxy Optimization and Multimodal Proxy Learning. Specifically, KPL retrieves image-relevant knowledge descriptions from the constructed knowledge-enhanced base to enrich semantic text proxies. It then harnesses input images and these descriptions, encoded via CLIP, to stably generate multimodal proxies that boost the zero-shot classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on both medical and natural image datasets demonstrate that KPL enables effective zero-shot image classification, outperforming all baselines. These findings highlight the great potential in this paradigm of mining knowledge from CLIP for medical image classification and broader areas.</p></details> | AAAI(Oral) |

Models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLama can use images to understand and analyze complex visual scenes. 3D objects and shapes are the basic building blocks of the world, recognizing them is a fundamental part of human perception. The goal of this work is to test whether LVLMs truly understand 3D shapes by testing the models ability to identify and match objects of the exact same 3D shapes but with different orientations and materials/textures. A large number of test images were created using CGI with a huge number of highly diverse objects, materials, and scenes. The results of this test show that the ability of such models to match 3D shapes is significantly below humans but much higher than random guesses. Suggesting that the models have gained some abstract understanding of 3D shapes but still trail far beyond humans in this task. Mainly it seems that the models can easily identify the same object with a different orientation as well as matching identical 3D shapes of the same orientation but with different materials and textures. However, when both the object material and orientation are changed, all models perform poorly relative to humans. Code and benchmark are available.</p></details> |  |

To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://ybendou.github.io/ProKeR</p></details> |

Despite this advancement, the safety of LVLMs remains adequately underexplored, with a potential overreliance on the safety assurances purported by their underlying LLMs. In this paper, we propose FigStep, a straightforward yet effective black-box jailbreak algorithm against LVLMs. Instead of feeding textual harmful instructions directly, FigStep converts the prohibited content into images through typography to bypass the safety alignment. The experimental results indicate that FigStep can achieve an average attack success rate of 82.50% on six promising open-source LVLMs. Not merely to demonstrate the efficacy of FigStep, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and analyze the distribution of the semantic embeddings to uncover that the reason behind the success of FigStep is the deficiency of safety alignment for visual embeddings. Moreover, we compare FigStep with five text-only jailbreaks and four image-based jailbreaks to demonstrate the superiority of FigStep, i.e., negligible attack costs and better attack performance. Above all, our work reveals that current LVLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which highlights the necessity of novel cross-modality safety alignment techniques.

In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that PyPE consistently improves the general capabilities of VLMs across various sizes.

As a first-step towards a space foundation model, we programmatically augment three extraterrestrial databases with fine-grained language annotations inspired by the sensory reasoning necessary to e.g., identify a site of scientific interest on Mars, building a synthetic dataset of visual-question-answer and visual instruction-following tuples. We fine-tune a pre-trained LLaVA 13B checkpoint on our augmented dataset to adapt a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to the visual semantic features in an extraterrestrial environment, demonstrating FMs as a tool for specialization and enhancing a VLM's zero-shot performance on unseen task types in comparison to state-of-the-art VLMs. Ablation studies show that fine-tuning the language backbone and vision-language adapter in concert is key to facilitate adaption while a small percentage, e.g., 20%, of the pre-training data can be used to safeguard against catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Aerospace Conference, 23 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We develop a novel approach that incorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with numerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series data. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how this approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.</p></details> |  |

Built from 3.4K original videos-expanded to over 17K tampered clips spanning 19 video tasks. MVTamperBench challenges models to detect manipulations in spatial and temporal coherence. We evaluate 45 recent MLLMs from 15+ model families, revealing substantial variability in resilience across tampering types and showing that larger parameter counts do not necessarily guarantee robustness. MVTamperBench sets a new benchmark for developing tamper-resilient MLLM in safety-critical applications, including detecting clickbait, preventing harmful content distribution, and enforcing policies on media platforms.

However, the excessive computational complexity limits the widespread use of these models in practical applications. We argue that one main bottleneck in computational complexity is caused by the involvement of redundant vision sequences in model computation. This is inspired by a reassessment of the efficiency of vision and language information transmission in the language decoder of LVLMs. Then, we propose a novel hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism called Hierarchical Vision injection for Mixture Attention (HiMix). In HiMix, only the language sequence undergoes full forward propagation, while the vision sequence interacts with the language at specific stages within each language decoder layer. It is striking that our approach significantly reduces computational complexity with minimal performance loss. Specifically, HiMix achieves a 10x reduction in the computational cost of the language decoder across multiple LVLM models while maintaining comparable performance. This highlights the advantages of our method, and we hope our research brings new perspectives to the field of vision-language understanding.

However, existing methods mostly seek a direct mapping function from visual data to the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which is contradictory to the mechanism of practical subjective evaluation. To address this, we propose a novel language-driven PCQA method named CLIP-PCQA. Considering that human beings prefer to describe visual quality using discrete quality descriptions (e.g., "excellent" and "poor") rather than specific scores, we adopt a retrieval-based mapping strategy to simulate the process of subjective assessment. More specifically, based on the philosophy of CLIP, we calculate the cosine similarity between the visual features and multiple textual features corresponding to different quality descriptions, in which process an effective contrastive loss and learnable prompts are introduced to enhance the feature extraction. Meanwhile, given the personal limitations and bias in subjective experiments, we further covert the feature similarities into probabilities and consider the Opinion Score Distribution (OSD) rather than a single MOS as the final target. Experimental results show that our CLIP-PCQA outperforms other State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> |  |

Without proper safeguards, however, VLMs may give harmful advice (e.g. how to self-harm) or encourage unsafe behaviours (e.g. to consume drugs). Despite these clear hazards, little work so far has evaluated VLM safety and the novel risks created by multimodal inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MSTS, a Multimodal Safety Test Suite for VLMs. MSTS comprises 400 test prompts across 40 fine-grained hazard categories. Each test prompt consists of a text and an image that only in combination reveal their full unsafe meaning. With MSTS, we find clear safety issues in several open VLMs. We also find some VLMs to be safe by accident, meaning that they are safe because they fail to understand even simple test prompts. We translate MSTS into ten languages, showing non-English prompts to increase the rate of unsafe model responses. We also show models to be safer when tested with text only rather than multimodal prompts. Finally, we explore the automation of VLM safety assessments, finding even the best safety classifiers to be lacking.</p></details> | under review |

Leveraging significant advancements in 3D generation from a single image, this paper proposes a novel method to mitigate HoOA in LVLMs. This method utilizes multiview images sampled from generated 3D representations as visual prompts for LVLMs, thereby providing more visual information from other viewpoints. Furthermore, we observe the input order of multiple multiview images significantly affects the performance of LVLMs. Consequently, we have devised Multiview Image Augmented VLM (MIAVLM), incorporating a Multiview Attributes Perceiver (MAP) submodule capable of simultaneously eliminating the influence of input image order and aligning visual information from multiview images with Large Language Models (LLMs). Besides, we designed and employed negative instructions to mitigate LVLMs' bias towards ``Yes" responses.

However, current LVLMs primarily rely on visual features extracted from the final layers of the vision encoder, overlooking the complementary information available in shallower layers. While recent approaches have explored the use of multilayer visual features in LVLMs, they tend to be task-agnostic and fail to examine the dependencies of hierarchical visual features on specific tasks. To address these gaps, we systematically investigate the contributions of visual features from different encoder layers using 18 benchmarks spanning 6 task categories. Our findings reveal that multilayer features provide complementary strengths with varying task dependencies, and uniform fusion leads to suboptimal performance. Building on these insights, we propose the instruction-guided vision aggregator, a module that dynamically integrates multi-layer visual features based on textual instructions, without increasing the number of visual tokens. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of the aggregator's behavior highlights the dominance of mid-to-high-level features in semantic-rich tasks and the critical role of low-level features in fine-grained perception.</p></details> |  |

However, the decision logic of these frameworks is often not transparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand, interpret or explain their behavior. This limitation hinders trust in machine learning systems and causes a general reluctance towards their adoption in practical applications, particularly in mission-critical domains like healthcare and autonomous driving. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques facilitate the explainability or interpretability of machine learning models, enabling users to discern the basis of the decision and possibly avert undesirable behavior. This comprehensive survey details the advancements of explainable AI methods, from inherently interpretable models to modern approaches for achieving interpretability of various black box models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we review explainable AI techniques that leverage LLM and vision-language model (VLM) frameworks to automate or improve the explainability of other machine learning models. The use of LLM and VLM as interpretability methods particularly enables high-level, semantically meaningful explanations of model decisions and behavior. Throughout the paper, we highlight the scientific principles, strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art methods and outline different areas of improvement. Where appropriate, we also present qualitative and quantitative comparison results of various methods to show how they compare.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention as a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from constructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in responses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data construction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We identify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the constructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO. Theoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by the presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference policy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically summarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address hallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment (OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct hallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised responses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO achieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B: 13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared to the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been effective in zero-shot tasks by leveraging their general knowledge from large-scale datasets. Recent studies demonstrate that transformer-based models with class-wise queries can effectively address zero-shot multi-label classification. However, poor utilization of the relationship between seen and unseen attributes makes the model lack generalizability. Additionally, attribute classification generally involves many attributes, making maintaining the model's scalability difficult. To address these issues, we propose Super-class guided transFormer (SugaFormer), a novel framework that leverages super-classes to enhance scalability and generalizability for zero-shot attribute classification. SugaFormer employs Super-class Query Initialization (SQI) to reduce the number of queries, utilizing common semantic information from super-classes, and incorporates Multi-context Decoding (MD) to handle diverse visual cues. To strengthen generalizability, we introduce two knowledge transfer strategies that utilize VLMs. During training, Super-class guided Consistency Regularization (SCR) aligns model's features with VLMs using super-class guided prompts, and during inference, Zero-shot Retrieval-based Score Enhancement (ZRSE) refines predictions for unseen attributes.

While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations.

Augmented Reality (AR) head worn devices can uniquely improve the user experience of solving procedural day-to-day tasks by providing egocentric multimodal (audio and video) observational capabilities to AI Agents. Such AR capabilities can help AI Agents see and listen to actions that users take which can relate to multimodal capabilities of human users. Existing AI Agents, either Large Language Models (LLMs) or Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reactive in nature, which means that models cannot take an action without reading or listening to the human user's prompts. Proactivity of AI Agents on the other hand can help the human user detect and correct any mistakes in agent observed tasks, encourage users when they do tasks correctly or simply engage in conversation with the user - akin to a human teaching or assisting a user. Our proposed YET to Intervene (YETI) multimodal agent focuses on the research question of identifying circumstances that may require the agent to intervene proactively. This allows the agent to understand when it can intervene in a conversation with human users that can help the user correct mistakes on tasks, like cooking, using AR. Our YETI Agent learns scene understanding signals based on interpretable notions of Structural Similarity (SSIM) on consecutive video frames. We also define the alignment signal which the AI Agent can learn to identify if the video frames corresponding to the user's actions on the task are consistent with expected actions. These signals are used by our AI Agent to determine when it should proactively intervene. We compare our results on the instances of proactive intervention in the HoloAssist multimodal benchmark for an expert agent guiding a user to complete procedural tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recent works proposed to utilize Large Language Models and pre-trained Vision-Language Models to automate the training of CBMs, making it more scalable and automated. However, existing approaches still fall short in two aspects: First, the concepts predicted by CBL often mismatch the input image, raising doubts about the faithfulness of interpretation. Second, it has been shown that concept values encode unintended information: even a set of random concepts could achieve comparable test accuracy to state-of-the-art CBMs. To address these critical limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework called Vision-Language-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (VLG-CBM) to enable faithful interpretability with the benefits of boosted performance. Our method leverages off-the-shelf open-domain grounded object detectors to provide visually grounded concept annotation, which largely enhances the faithfulness of concept prediction while further improving the model performance. In addition, we propose a new metric called Number of Effective Concepts (NEC) to control the information leakage and provide better interpretability. Extensive evaluations across five standard benchmarks show that our method, VLG-CBM, outperforms existing methods by at least 4.27% and up to 51.09% on Accuracy at NEC=5 (denoted as ANEC-5), and by at least 0.45% and up to 29.78% on average accuracy (denoted as ANEC-avg), while preserving both faithfulness and interpretability of the learned concepts as demonstrated in extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, due to the complexity of deployment environments or the prevalence of ambiguous-condition objects, the practical application of robotics still faces many challenges, leading to frequent errors. Traditional methods and some LLM-based approaches, although improved, still require substantial human intervention and struggle with autonomous error correction in complex scenarios.In this work, we propose RoboReflect, a novel framework leveraging large vision-language models (LVLMs) to enable self-reflection and autonomous error correction in robotic grasping tasks. RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved.The corrected strategies are saved in a memory for future task reference.We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories.Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques using GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's ability to adapt and correct errors independently. These findings underscore the critical importance of autonomous selfreflection in robotic systems while effectively addressing the challenges posed by ambiguous environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Adaptive Vision-Language Fine-tuning with Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment (HiCA), a novel framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for medical image analysis. HiCA introduces a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, combining domain-specific pretraining and hierarchical contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations at multiple levels. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, Chest X-ray and Breast Ultrasound, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. Further analyses demonstrate the robustness, generalizability, and interpretability of our method, with substantial improvements in performance compared to existing baselines. Our work highlights the potential of hierarchical contrastive strategies in adapting LVLMs to the unique challenges of medical imaging tasks.</p></details> |  |

These technologies have the potential to revolutionize traditional workflows by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and safety in construction management. Ground robots equipped with advanced vision systems could automate tasks such as monitoring mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) systems. The present research evaluates the applicability of open-vocabulary vision-language models compared to fine-tuned, lightweight, closed-set object detectors for detecting MEP components using a mobile ground robotic platform. A dataset collected with cameras mounted on a ground robot was manually annotated and analyzed to compare model performance. The results demonstrate that, despite the versatility of vision-language models, fine-tuned lightweight models still largely outperform them in specialized environments and for domain-specific tasks.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

However, unlike traditional web applications, HTML5 <canvas> applications render objects onto the <canvas> bitmap without representing them in the Document Object Model (DOM). Mismatches between the expected and actual visual output of the <canvas> bitmap are termed visual bugs. Due to the visual-centric nature of <canvas> applications, visual bugs are important to detect because such bugs can render a <canvas> application useless. As we showed in prior work, Asset-Based graphics can provide the ground truth for a visual test oracle. However, many <canvas> applications procedurally generate their graphics. In this paper, we investigate how to detect visual bugs in <canvas> applications that use Procedural graphics as well. In particular, we explore the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically detect visual bugs. Instead of defining an exact visual test oracle, information about the application's expected functionality (the context) can be provided with the screenshot as input to the VLM. To evaluate this approach, we constructed a dataset containing 80 bug-injected screenshots across four visual bug types (Layout, Rendering, Appearance, and State) plus 20 bug-free screenshots from 20 <canvas> applications. We ran experiments with a state-of-the-art VLM using several combinations of text and image context to describe each application's expected functionality. Our results show that by providing the application README(s), a description of visual bug types, and a bug-free screenshot as context, VLMs can be leveraged to detect visual bugs with up to 100% per-application accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal</p></details> |

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city. To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required. In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description. To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations. The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders. The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches. Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks. Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding. To this end, we compiled 38 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 101 different target conditions and 288,307 images. We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data. Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them. We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories. When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes. Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a wide margin larger-scale generalist image-language models and retina domain-specific self-supervised networks, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing.

Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition.

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
