| **[Terrain Classification Enhanced with Uncertainty for Space Exploration Robots from Proprioceptive Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03241v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Terrain Classification is an essential task in space exploration, where unpredictable environments are difficult to observe using only exteroceptive sensors such as vision. Implementing Neural Network classifiers can have high performance but can be deemed untrustworthy as they lack transparency, which makes them unreliable for taking high-stakes decisions during mission planning. We address this by proposing Neural Networks with Uncertainty Quantification in Terrain Classification. We enable our Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Dropout, DropConnect, and Flipout in time series-capable architectures using only proprioceptive data as input. We use Bayesian Optimization with Hyperband for efficient hyperparameter optimization to find optimal models for trustworthy terrain classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Multiple-Resolution Tokenization for Time Series Forecasting with an Application to Pricing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03185v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a transformer architecture for time series forecasting with a focus on time series tokenisation and apply it to a real-world prediction problem from the pricing domain. Our architecture aims to learn effective representations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The model contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series patching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for time-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series information, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the increased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real world prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer. On the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the selected existing deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fredformer: Frequency Debiased Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09009v4)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer model has shown leading performance in time series forecasting. Nevertheless, in some complex scenarios, it tends to learn low-frequency features in the data and overlook high-frequency features, showing a frequency bias. This bias prevents the model from accurately capturing important high-frequency data features. In this paper, we undertook empirical analyses to understand this bias and discovered that frequency bias results from the model disproportionately focusing on frequency features with higher energy. Based on our analysis, we formulate this bias and propose Fredformer, a Transformer-based framework designed to mitigate frequency bias by learning features equally across different frequency bands. This approach prevents the model from overlooking lower amplitude features important for accurate forecasting. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which can outperform other baselines in different real-world time-series datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight variant of the Fredformer with an attention matrix approximation, which achieves comparable performance but with much fewer parameters and lower computation costs. The code is available at: https://github.com/chenzRG/Fredformer</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGKDD2024</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks Against Time-Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02870v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing time-series data that may contain personal information, particularly in the medical field, presents serious privacy concerns. Sensitive health data from patients is often used to train machine-learning models for diagnostics and ongoing care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable decisions on whether to use a model in production, share it with third parties, or deploy it in patients homes. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been thoroughly studied in this context. We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical data applications.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[A Self-Supervised Task for Fault Detection in Satellite Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02861v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the space sector, due to environmental conditions and restricted accessibility, robust fault detection methods are imperative for ensuring mission success and safeguarding valuable assets. This work proposes a novel approach leveraging Physics-Informed Real NVP neural networks, renowned for their ability to model complex and high-dimensional distributions, augmented with a self-supervised task based on sensors' data permutation. It focuses on enhancing fault detection within the satellite multivariate time series. The experiments involve various configurations, including pre-training with self-supervision, multi-task learning, and standalone self-supervised training. Results indicate significant performance improvements across all settings. In particular, employing only the self-supervised loss yields the best overall results, suggesting its efficacy in guiding the network to extract relevant features for fault detection. This study presents a promising direction for improving fault detection in space systems and warrants further exploration in other datasets and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPAIC...</summary><p>SPAICE: AI in and for Space, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Large Scale Hierarchical Industrial Demand Time-Series Forecasting incorporating Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02657v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical time-series forecasting (HTSF) is an important problem for many real-world business applications where the goal is to simultaneously forecast multiple time-series that are related to each other via a hierarchical relation. Recent works, however, do not address two important challenges that are typically observed in many demand forecasting applications at large companies. First, many time-series at lower levels of the hierarchy have high sparsity i.e., they have a significant number of zeros. Most HTSF methods do not address this varying sparsity across the hierarchy. Further, they do not scale well to the large size of the real-world hierarchy typically unseen in benchmarks used in literature. We resolve both these challenges by proposing HAILS, a novel probabilistic hierarchical model that enables accurate and calibrated probabilistic forecasts across the hierarchy by adaptively modeling sparse and dense time-series with different distributional assumptions and reconciling them to adhere to hierarchical constraints. We show the scalability and effectiveness of our methods by evaluating them against real-world demand forecasting datasets. We deploy HAILS at a large chemical manufacturing company for a product demand forecasting application with over ten thousand products and observe a significant 8.5\% improvement in forecast accuracy and 23% better improvement for sparse time-series. The enhanced accuracy and scalability make HAILS a valuable tool for improved business planning and customer experience.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2024 |
| **[Learning Graph Structures and Uncertainty for Accurate and Calibrated Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02641v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-variate time series forecasting is an important problem with a wide range of applications. Recent works model the relations between time-series as graphs and have shown that propagating information over the relation graph can improve time series forecasting. However, in many cases, relational information is not available or is noisy and reliable. Moreover, most works ignore the underlying uncertainty of time-series both for structure learning and deriving the forecasts resulting in the structure not capturing the uncertainty resulting in forecast distributions with poor uncertainty estimates. We tackle this challenge and introduce STOIC, that leverages stochastic correlations between time-series to learn underlying structure between time-series and to provide well-calibrated and accurate forecasts. Over a wide-range of benchmark datasets STOIC provides around 16% more accurate and 14% better-calibrated forecasts. STOIC also shows better adaptation to noise in data during inference and captures important and useful relational information in various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inclu...</summary><p>Included reference to codebase.

| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

SiamTST integrates a Siamese network with attention, channel-independent patching, and normalization techniques to achieve superior performance. Evaluated on a real-world industrial telecommunication dataset, SiamTST demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy over existing methods. Notably, a simple linear network also shows competitive performance, achieving the second-best results, just behind SiamTST.

The data structure supports local operations, including the insertion and deletion of an item and the cutting and concatenating of lists, each in time $O(\log n + k)$, in which $n$ counts the critical items and $k$ the changes in the augmented persistence diagram. To achieve this, we design a tailor-made tree structure with an unconventional representation, referred to as banana tree, which may be useful in its own right.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected the statement and proof of Theorem 5.2; added a missing edge-case to the anti-cancellation algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Improved Genetic Algorithm Based on Greedy and Simulated Annealing Ideas for Vascular Robot Ordering Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19484v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a comprehensive approach for optimizing the acquisition, utilization, and maintenance of ABLVR vascular robots in healthcare settings. Medical robotics, particularly in vascular treatments, necessitates precise resource allocation and optimization due to the complex nature of robot and operator maintenance. Traditional heuristic methods, though intuitive, often fail to achieve global optimization. To address these challenges, this research introduces a novel strategy, combining mathematical modeling, a hybrid genetic algorithm, and ARIMA time series forecasting. Considering the dynamic healthcare environment, our approach includes a robust resource allocation model for robotic vessels and operators. We incorporate the unique requirements of the adaptive learning process for operators and the maintenance needs of robotic components. The hybrid genetic algorithm, integrating simulated annealing and greedy approaches, efficiently solves the optimization problem. Additionally, ARIMA time series forecasting predicts the demand for vascular robots, further enhancing the adaptability of our strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of optimization, transparency, and convergence speed from other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Automated Knowledge Graph Learning in Industrial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02106v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial processes generate vast amounts of time series data, yet extracting meaningful relationships and insights remains challenging. This paper introduces a framework for automated knowledge graph learning from time series data, specifically tailored for industrial applications. Our framework addresses the complexities inherent in industrial datasets, transforming them into knowledge graphs that improve decision-making, process optimization, and knowledge discovery. Additionally, it employs Granger causality to identify key attributes that can inform the design of predictive models. To illustrate the practical utility of our approach, we also present a motivating use case demonstrating the benefits of our framework in a real-world industrial scenario. Further, we demonstrate how the automated conversion of time series data into knowledge graphs can identify causal influences or dependencies between important process parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavior Forests: Real-Time Discovery of Dynamic Behavior for Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02008v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Driving Systems (ADS) development relies on utilizing real-world vehicle data. The volume of data generated by modern vehicles presents transmission, storage, and computational challenges. Focusing on Dynamic Behavior (DB) offers a promising approach to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information for ADS functionalities, thereby reducing data. Time series pattern recognition is beneficial for this task as it can analyze the temporal context of vehicle driving behavior. However, existing state-of-the-art methods often lack the adaptability to identify variable-length patterns or provide analytical descriptions of discovered patterns. This contribution proposes a Behavior Forest framework for real-time data selection by constructing a Behavior Graph during vehicle operation, facilitating analytical descriptions without pre-training. The method demonstrates its performance using a synthetically generated and electrocardiogram data set. An automotive time series data set is used to evaluate the data reduction capabilities, in which this method discarded 96.01% of the incoming data stream, while relevant DB remain included.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI for Synthetic Data Across Multiple Medical Modalities: A Systematic Review of Recent Developments and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00116v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of generative models (GANs, VAEs, DMs, and LLMs) used to synthesize various medical data types, including imaging (dermoscopic, mammographic, ultrasound, CT, MRI, and X-ray), text, time-series, and tabular data (EHR). Unlike previous narrowly focused reviews, our study encompasses a broad array of medical data modalities and explores various generative models. Our search strategy queries databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and ArXiv, focusing on recent works from January 2021 to November 2023, excluding reviews and perspectives. This period emphasizes recent advancements beyond GANs, which have been extensively covered previously. The survey reveals insights from three key aspects: (1) Synthesis applications and purpose of synthesis, (2) generation techniques, and (3) evaluation methods. It highlights clinically valid synthesis applications, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data to tackle diverse clinical requirements. While conditional models incorporating class labels, segmentation masks and image translations are prevalent, there is a gap in utilizing prior clinical knowledge and patient-specific context, suggesting a need for more personalized synthesis approaches and emphasizing the importance of tailoring generative approaches to the unique characteristics of medical data. Additionally, there is a significant gap in using synthetic data beyond augmentation, such as for validation and evaluation of downstream medical AI models. The survey uncovers that the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies tailored to medical images is a barrier to clinical application, underscoring the need for in-depth evaluation approaches, benchmarking, and comparative studies to promote openness and collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Distributed Network Digital Twin Systems Against Model Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01917v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of 5G and beyond, the increasing complexity of wireless networks necessitates innovative frameworks for efficient management and deployment. Digital twins (DTs), embodying real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and enhanced decision-making capabilities, stand out as a promising solution in this context. Within a time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital counterparts, encapsulated by integrated vertical and horizontal twinning phases, this study investigates the security challenges in distributed network DT systems, which potentially undermine the reliability of subsequent network applications such as wireless traffic forecasting. Specifically, we consider a minimal-knowledge scenario for all attackers, in that they do not have access to network data and other specialized knowledge, yet can interact with previous iterations of server-level models. In this context, we spotlight a novel fake traffic injection attack designed to compromise a distributed network DT system for wireless traffic prediction. In response, we then propose a defense mechanism, termed global-local inconsistency detection (GLID), to counteract various model poisoning threats. GLID strategically removes abnormal model parameters that deviate beyond a particular percentile range, thereby fortifying the security of network twinning process. Through extensive experiments on real-world wireless traffic datasets, our experimental evaluations show that both our attack and defense strategies significantly outperform existing baselines, highlighting the importance of security measures in the design and implementation of DTs for 5G and beyond network systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internet of Things Journal (IoT-J). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.14389</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Trust Dynamics with Dynamic SEM in Human-AI Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01752v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans' trust in AI constitutes a pivotal element in fostering a synergistic relationship between humans and AI. This is particularly significant in the context of systems that leverage AI technology, such as autonomous driving systems and human-robot interaction. Trust facilitates appropriate utilization of these systems, thereby optimizing their potential benefits. If humans over-trust or under-trust an AI, serious problems such as misuse and accidents occur. To prevent over/under-trust, it is necessary to predict trust dynamics. However, trust is an internal state of humans and hard to directly observe. Therefore, we propose a prediction model for trust dynamics using dynamic structure equation modeling, which extends SEM that can handle time-series data. A path diagram, which shows causalities between variables, is developed in an exploratory way and the resultant path diagram is optimized for effective path structures. Over/under-trust was predicted with 90\% accuracy in a drone simulator task,, and it was predicted with 99\% accuracy in an autonomous driving task. These results show that our proposed method outperformed the conventional method including an auto regression family.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalization and Approximation Capacities of Neural Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16791v4)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) are a state-of-the-art tool for supervised learning with irregularly sampled time series (Kidger, 2020). However, no theoretical analysis of their performance has been provided yet, and it remains unclear in particular how the irregularity of the time series affects their predictions. By merging the rich theory of controlled differential equations (CDE) and Lipschitz-based measures of the complexity of deep neural nets, we take a first step towards the theoretical understanding of NCDE. Our first result is a generalization bound for this class of predictors that depends on the regularity of the time series data. In a second time, we leverage the continuity of the flow of CDEs to provide a detailed analysis of both the sampling-induced bias and the approximation bias. Regarding this last result, we show how classical approximation results on neural nets may transfer to NCDEs. Our theoretical results are validated through a series of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

| **[Topo4D: Topology-Preserving Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity 4D Head Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00440v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D head capture aims to generate dynamic topological meshes and corresponding texture maps from videos, which is widely utilized in movies and games for its ability to simulate facial muscle movements and recover dynamic textures in pore-squeezing. The industry often adopts the method involving multi-view stereo and non-rigid alignment. However, this approach is prone to errors and heavily reliant on time-consuming manual processing by artists. To simplify this process, we propose Topo4D, a novel framework for automatic geometry and texture generation, which optimizes densely aligned 4D heads and 8K texture maps directly from calibrated multi-view time-series images. Specifically, we first represent the time-series faces as a set of dynamic 3D Gaussians with fixed topology in which the Gaussian centers are bound to the mesh vertices. Afterward, we perform alternative geometry and texture optimization frame-by-frame for high-quality geometry and texture learning while maintaining temporal topology stability. Finally, we can extract dynamic facial meshes in regular wiring arrangement and high-fidelity textures with pore-level details from the learned Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than the current SOTA face reconstruction methods both in the quality of meshes and textures.

| **[Deep Learning Models for Flapping Fin Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Control System Gait Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01222v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The last few decades have led to the rise of research focused on propulsion and control systems for bio-inspired unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), which provide more maneuverable alternatives to traditional UUVs in underwater missions. Recent work has explored the use of time-series neural network surrogate models to predict thrust and power from vehicle design and fin kinematics. We develop a search-based inverse model that leverages kinematics-to-thrust and kinematics-to-power neural network models for control system design. Our inverse model finds a set of fin kinematics with the multi-objective goal of reaching a target thrust under power constraints while creating a smooth kinematics transition between flapping cycles. We demonstrate how a control system integrating this inverse model can make online, cycle-to-cycle adjustments to prioritize different system objectives, with improvements in increasing thrust generation or reducing power consumption of any given movement upwards of 0.5 N and 3.0 W in a range of 2.2 N and 9.0 W. As propulsive efficiency is of utmost importance for flapping-fin UUVs in order to extend their range and endurance for essential operations but lacks prior research, we develop a non-dimensional figure of merit (FOM), derived from measures of propulsive efficiency, that is able to evaluate different fin designs and kinematics, and allow for comparison with other bio-inspired platforms. We use the developed FOM to analyze optimal gaits and compare the performance between different fin materials, providing a better understanding of how fin materials affect thrust generation and propulsive efficiency and allowing us to inform control systems and weight for efficiency on the developed inverse gait-selector model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 20 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.14135</p></details> |

| **[HGNET: A Hierarchical Feature Guided Network for Occupancy Flow Field Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01097v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the motion of multiple traffic participants has always been one of the most challenging tasks in autonomous driving. The recently proposed occupancy flow field prediction method has shown to be a more effective and scalable representation compared to general trajectory prediction methods. However, in complex multi-agent traffic scenarios, it remains difficult to model the interactions among various factors and the dependencies among prediction outputs at different time steps. In view of this, we propose a transformer-based hierarchical feature guided network (HGNET), which can efficiently extract features of agents and map information from visual and vectorized inputs, modeling multimodal interaction relationships. Second, we design the Feature-Guided Attention (FGAT) module to leverage the potential guiding effects between different prediction targets, thereby improving prediction accuracy. Additionally, to enhance the temporal consistency and causal relationships of the predictions, we propose a Time Series Memory framework to learn the conditional distribution models of the prediction outputs at future time steps from multivariate time series. The results demonstrate that our model exhibits competitive performance, which ranks 3rd in the 2024 Waymo Occupancy and Flow Prediction Challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revitalizing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learnable Decomposition with Inter-Series Dependencies and Intra-Series Variations Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12694v4)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting multivariate time series is crucial, demanding precise modeling of intricate patterns, including inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations. Distinctive trend characteristics in each time series pose challenges, and existing methods, relying on basic moving average kernels, may struggle with the non-linear structure and complex trends in real-world data. Given that, we introduce a learnable decomposition strategy to capture dynamic trend information more reasonably. Additionally, we propose a dual attention module tailored to capture inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations simultaneously for better time series forecasting, which is implemented by channel-wise self-attention and autoregressive self-attention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across eight open-source datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. Through the comparison results, our Leddam (LEarnable Decomposition and Dual Attention Module) not only demonstrates significant advancements in predictive performance, but also the proposed decomposition strategy can be plugged into other methods with a large performance-boosting, from 11.87% to 48.56% MSE error degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARLP: Time-series Forecasting Control for Agricultural Managed Aquifer Recharge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01005v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid decline in groundwater around the world poses a significant challenge to sustainable agriculture. To address this issue, agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) is proposed to recharge the aquifer by artificially flooding agricultural lands using surface water. Ag-MAR requires a carefully selected flooding schedule to avoid affecting the oxygen absorption of crop roots. However, current Ag-MAR scheduling does not take into account complex environmental factors such as weather and soil oxygen, resulting in crop damage and insufficient recharging amounts. This paper proposes MARLP, the first end-to-end data-driven control system for Ag-MAR. We first formulate Ag-MAR as an optimization problem. To that end, we analyze four-year in-field datasets, which reveal the multi-periodicity feature of the soil oxygen level trends and the opportunity to use external weather forecasts and flooding proposals as exogenous clues for soil oxygen prediction. Then, we design a two-stage forecasting framework. In the first stage, it extracts both the cross-variate dependency and the periodic patterns from historical data to conduct preliminary forecasting. In the second stage, it uses weather-soil and flooding-soil causality to facilitate an accurate prediction of soil oxygen levels. Finally, we conduct model predictive control (MPC) for Ag-MAR flooding. To address the challenge of large action spaces, we devise a heuristic planning module to reduce the number of flooding proposals to enable the search for optimal solutions. Real-world experiments show that MARLP reduces the oxygen deficit ratio by 86.8% while improving the recharging amount in unit time by 35.8%, compared with the previous four years.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[FAITH: Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13300v3)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as industrial equipment maintenance, meteorology, energy consumption, traffic flow and financial investment. However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs.

| **[Background-aware Multi-source Fusion Financial Trend Forecasting Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00904v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock prices, as an economic indicator, reflect changes in economic development and market conditions. Traditional stock price prediction models often only consider time-series data and are limited by the mechanisms of the models themselves. Some deep learning models have high computational costs, depend on a large amount of high-quality data, and have poor interpretations, making it difficult to intuitively understand the driving factors behind the predictions. Some studies have used deep learning models to extract text features and combine them with price data to make joint predictions, but there are issues with dealing with information noise, accurate extraction of text sentiment, and how to efficiently fuse text and numerical data. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a background-aware multi-source fusion financial trend forecasting mechanism. The system leverages a large language model to extract key information from policy and stock review texts, utilizing the MacBERT model to generate feature vectors. These vectors are then integrated with stock price data to form comprehensive feature representations. These integrated features are input into a neural network comprising various deep learning architectures. By integrating multiple data sources, the system offers a holistic view of market dynamics. It harnesses the comprehensive analytical and interpretative capabilities of large language models, retaining deep semantic and sentiment information from policy texts to provide richer input features for stock trend prediction. Additionally, we compare the accuracy of six models (LSTM, BiLSTM, MogrifierLSTM, GRU, ST-LSTM, SwinLSTM). The results demonstrate that our system achieves generally better accuracy in predicting stock movements, attributed to the incorporation of large language model processing, policy information, and other influential features.</p></details> |  |

In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Role of Data Enrichment Approaches Towards Rare Event Analysis in Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01644v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare events are occurrences that take place with a significantly lower frequency than more common regular events. In manufacturing, predicting such events is particularly important, as they lead to unplanned downtime, shortening equipment lifespan, and high energy consumption. The occurrence of events is considered frequently-rare if observed in more than 10% of all instances, very-rare if it is 1-5%, moderately-rare if it is 5-10%, and extremely-rare if less than 1%. The rarity of events is inversely correlated with the maturity of a manufacturing industry. Typically, the rarity of events affects the multivariate data generated within a manufacturing process to be highly imbalanced, which leads to bias in predictive models. This paper evaluates the role of data enrichment techniques combined with supervised machine-learning techniques for rare event detection and prediction. To address the data scarcity, we use time series data augmentation and sampling methods to amplify the dataset with more multivariate features and data points while preserving the underlying time series patterns in the combined alterations. Imputation techniques are used in handling null values in datasets. Considering 15 learning models ranging from statistical learning to machine learning to deep learning methods, the best-performing model for the selected datasets is obtained and the efficacy of data enrichment is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, our results find that the enrichment procedure enhances up to 48% of F1 measure in rare failure event detection and prediction of supervised prediction models. We also conduct empirical and ablation experiments on the datasets to derive dataset-specific novel insights. Finally, we investigate the interpretability aspect of models for rare event prediction, considering multiple methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble methods do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a clean and neat set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed method works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and does not require parameter tuning under the most common setting. Through rigorous computational experiments, we offer statistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other rule extraction methods and effectively handles time series.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of EHRs in data-driven modeling faces challenges such as irregularly spaced multi-variate time series, issues of incompleteness, and data imbalance. Realizing the full data potential of EHRs hinges on the development of advanced analytical models. In this paper, we propose a novel Missingness-aware mUlti-branching Self-attention Encoder (MUSE-Net) to cope with the challenges in modeling longitudinal EHRs for data-driven disease prediction. The MUSE-Net leverages a multi-task Gaussian process (MGP) with missing value masks for data imputation, a multi-branching architecture to address the data imbalance problem, and a time-aware self-attention encoder to account for the irregularly spaced time interval in longitudinal EHRs. We evaluate the proposed MUSE-Net using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that our MUSE-Net outperforms existing methods that are widely used to investigate longitudinal signals.</p></details> |  |

Understanding forthcoming changes in these prices is essential for bolstering food security, particularly for nations at risk. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) previously developed sophisticated statistical frameworks for the proactive prediction of food commodity prices, aiding in the creation of global early warning systems. These frameworks utilize food security indicators to produce accurate forecasts, thereby facilitating preparations against potential food shortages. Our research builds on these foundations by integrating robust price security indicators with cutting-edge deep learning (DL) methodologies to reveal complex interdependencies. DL techniques examine intricate dynamics among diverse factors affecting food prices. Through sophisticated time-series forecasting models coupled with a classification model, our approach enhances existing models to better support communities worldwide in advancing their food security initiatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICS ...</summary><p>MICS 2024 1st Place Paper, MSOE AI-Club Research Group</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Diffusion Method: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Vibration Signal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07981v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful data generation capabilities in various research fields such as image generation. However, in the field of vibration signal generation, the criteria for evaluating the quality of the generated signal are different from that of image generation and there is a fundamental difference between them. At present, there is no research on the ability of diffusion model to generate vibration signal. In this paper, a Time Series Diffusion Method (TSDM) is proposed for vibration signal generation, leveraging the foundational principles of diffusion models. The TSDM uses an improved U-net architecture with attention block, ResBlock and TimeEmbedding to effectively segment and extract features from one-dimensional time series data. It operates based on forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes for time-series generation. Experimental validation is conducted using single-frequency, multi-frequency datasets, and bearing fault datasets. The results show that TSDM can accurately generate the single-frequency and multi-frequency features in the time series and retain the basic frequency features for the diffusion generation results of the bearing fault series. It is also found that the original DDPM could not generate high quality vibration signals, but the improved U-net in TSDM, which applied the combination of attention block and ResBlock, could effectively improve the quality of vibration signal generation. Finally, TSDM is applied to the small sample fault diagnosis of three public bearing fault datasets, and the results show that the accuracy of small sample fault diagnosis of the three datasets is improved by 32.380%, 18.355% and 9.298% at most, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Frequency Derivative Learning for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00502v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most time series are non-stationary, it is inevitable for models to face the distribution shift issue in time series forecasting. Existing solutions manipulate statistical measures (usually mean and std.) to adjust time series distribution. However, these operations can be theoretically seen as the transformation towards zero frequency component of the spectrum which cannot reveal full distribution information and would further lead to information utilization bottleneck in normalization, thus hindering forecasting performance. To address this problem, we propose to utilize the whole frequency spectrum to transform time series to make full use of data distribution from the frequency perspective. We present a deep frequency derivative learning framework, DERITS, for non-stationary time series forecasting. Specifically, DERITS is built upon a novel reversible transformation, namely Frequency Derivative Transformation (FDT) that makes signals derived in the frequency domain to acquire more stationary frequency representations. Then, we propose the Order-adaptive Fourier Convolution Network to conduct adaptive frequency filtering and learning. Furthermore, we organize DERITS as a parallel-stacked architecture for the multi-order derivation and fusion for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several datasets which show the consistent superiority in both time series forecasting and shift alleviation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

[Local and global trend Bayesian exponential smoothing models. International Journal of Forecasting, 2024.], a generalised exponential smoothing model was proposed that is able to capture strong trends and volatility in time series. This method achieved state-of-the-art performance in many forecasting tasks, but its fitting procedure, which is based on the NUTS sampler, is very computationally expensive. In this work, we propose several modifications to the original model, as well as a bespoke Gibbs sampler for posterior exploration; these changes improve sampling time by an order of magnitude, thus rendering the model much more practically relevant. The new model, and sampler, are evaluated on the M3 dataset and are shown to be competitive, or superior, in terms of accuracy to the original method, while being substantially faster to run.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowing When to Stop: Delay-Adaptive Spiking Neural Network Classifiers with Reliability Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11322v4)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process time-series data via internal event-driven neural dynamics. The energy consumption of an SNN depends on the number of spikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. Typically, decisions are produced after the entire input sequence has been processed. This results in latency and energy consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. However, as explored in recent work, SNNs can produce an early decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident'', adapting delay and energy consumption to the difficulty of each example. Existing techniques are based on heuristic measures of confidence that do not provide reliability guarantees, potentially exiting too early. In this paper, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping times. The approach, dubbed SpikeCP, leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP). It entails minimal complexity increase as compared to the underlying SNN, requiring only additional thresholding and counting operations at run time. SpikeCP is also extended to integrate a CP-aware training phase that targets delay performance. Variants of CP based on alternative confidence correction schemes, from Bonferroni to Simes, are explored, and extensive experiments are described using the MNIST-DVS data set, DVS128 Gesture dataset, and CIFAR-10 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Clustering with General State Space Models via Stochastic Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00429v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel method of model-based time series clustering with mixtures of general state space models (MSSMs). Each component of MSSMs is associated with each cluster. An advantage of the proposed method is that it enables the use of time series models appropriate to the specific time series. This not only improves clustering and prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of the estimated parameters. The parameters of the MSSMs are estimated using stochastic variational inference, a subtype of variational inference. The proposed method estimates the latent variables of an arbitrary state space model by using neural networks with a normalizing flow as a variational estimator. The number of clusters can be estimated using the Bayesian information criterion. In addition, to prevent MSSMs from converging to the local optimum, we propose several optimization tricks, including an additional penalty term called entropy annealing. Experiments on simulated datasets show that the proposed method is effective for clustering, parameter estimation, and estimating the number of clusters.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

GPs can handle complex, nonlinear dynamics but are computationally demanding, while LDSs offer efficient computation but lack the expressive power of GPs. To combine their benefits, we introduce a universal method that allows an LDS to mirror stationary temporal GPs. This state-space representation, known as the Markovian Gaussian Process (Markovian GP), leverages the flexibility of kernel functions while maintaining efficient linear computation. Unlike existing GP-LDS conversion methods, which require separability for most multi-output kernels, our approach works universally for single- and multi-output stationary temporal kernels. We evaluate our method by computing covariance, performing regression tasks, and applying it to a neuroscience application, demonstrating that our method provides an accurate state-space representation for stationary temporal GPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Prediction Delays in Time Series Forecasting: A Continuous GRU Approach with Derivative Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01622v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting has been an essential field in many different application areas, including economic analysis, meteorology, and so forth. The majority of time series forecasting models are trained using the mean squared error (MSE). However, this training based on MSE causes a limitation known as prediction delay. The prediction delay, which implies the ground-truth precedes the prediction, can cause serious problems in a variety of fields, e.g., finance and weather forecasting -- as a matter of fact, predictions succeeding ground-truth observations are not practically meaningful although their MSEs can be low. This paper proposes a new perspective on traditional time series forecasting tasks and introduces a new solution to mitigate the prediction delay. We introduce a continuous-time gated recurrent unit (GRU) based on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) which can supervise explicit time-derivatives. We generalize the GRU architecture in a continuous-time manner and minimize the prediction delay through our time-derivative regularization. Our method outperforms in metrics such as MSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Time Distortion Index (TDI). In addition, we demonstrate the low prediction delay of our method in a variety of datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2024 accepted paper</p></details> |

However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) for such non-intervention systems, along with its computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), to quantify causality. The IEE criterion theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. Demonstrations of performance showed the accuracy and robustness of IEE on benchmark simulated systems as well as real-world systems, including the neural connectomes of C. elegans, COVID-19 transmission networks in Japan, and regulatory networks surrounding key circadian genes.</p></details> |  |

In the current work, we have explored three variants of DDoS attacks, namely Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and TCP + ICMP flooding attacks, and developed a detection mechanism that runs on the companion computer of the UAV system. As a part of the detection mechanism, we have evaluated various machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, such as XGBoost, Isolation Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM), LSTM with attention, Bi-LSTM with attention, and Time Series Transformer (TST) in terms of various classification metrics. Our evaluation reveals that algorithms with attention mechanisms outperform their counterparts in general, and TST stands out as the most efficient model with a run time of 0.1 seconds. TST has demonstrated an F1 score of 0.999, 0.997, and 0.943 for TCP, ICMP, and TCP + ICMP flooding attacks respectively. In this work, we present the necessary steps required to build an on-board DDoS detection mechanism. Further, we also present the ablation study to identify the best TST hyperparameters for DDoS detection, and we have also underscored the advantage of adapting learnable positional embeddings in TST for DDoS detection with an improvement in F1 score from 0.94 to 0.99.</p></details> |  |

Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

The scene classification layer (SCL) inside the S2 product provides rich information for training, such as filtering images with high cloud coverage. However, there is more potential in this. We propose a technique to assess the clean optical coverage of a region, expressed by a SITS and calculated with the S2-based SCL data. With a manual threshold and specific labels in the SCL, the proposed technique assigns a percentage of spatial and temporal coverage across the time series and a high/low assessment. By evaluating the AI4EO challenge for Enhanced Agriculture, we show that the assessment is correlated to the predictive results of ML models. The classification results in a region with low spatial and temporal coverage is worse than in a region with high coverage.

Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which samples of future time series are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.</p></details> |  |

This data has become instrumental in analyzing the quality of manufacturing process and equipment. Engineers and data analysts, in particular, require extensive time-series data for seasonal cycle analysis. However, due to computational resource constraints, they are often limited to querying short-term data multiple times or resorting to the use of summarized data in which key patterns may be overlooked. This study proposes a novel solution to overcome these limitations; the advanced resolution-based pixel preemption data filtering (AR-PPF) algorithm. This technology allows for efficient visualization of time-series charts over long periods while significantly reducing the time required to retrieve data. We also demonstrates how this approach not only enhances the efficiency of data analysis but also ensures that key feature is not lost, thereby providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages, preprint, '24 Samsung Best Paper Awards</p></details> |

However, training models for SITS segmentation remains a challenging task due to the lack of abundant training data, which requires fine grained annotation. We propose S4 a new self-supervised pre-training approach that significantly reduces the requirement for labeled training data by utilizing two new insights: (a) Satellites capture images in different parts of the spectrum such as radio frequencies, and visible frequencies. (b) Satellite imagery is geo-registered allowing for fine-grained spatial alignment. We use these insights to formulate pre-training tasks in S4. We also curate m2s2-SITS, a large-scale dataset of unlabeled, spatially-aligned, multi-modal and geographic specific SITS that serves as representative pre-training data for S4. Finally, we evaluate S4 on multiple SITS segmentation datasets and demonstrate its efficacy against competing baselines while using limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 $\pm$ 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 $\pm$ 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.</p></details> |  |

Yet the prevailing assumption that transfer learning consistently outperforms training from scratch has never been systematically validated. In this study, we conduct the first extensive empirical study on the effectiveness of transfer learning in multi-label ECG classification, by investigating comparing the fine-tuning performance with that of training from scratch, covering a variety of ECG datasets and deep neural networks. We confirm that fine-tuning is the preferable choice for small downstream datasets; however, when the dataset is sufficiently large, training from scratch can achieve comparable performance, albeit requiring a longer training time to catch up. Furthermore, we find that transfer learning exhibits better compatibility with convolutional neural networks than with recurrent neural networks, which are the two most prevalent architectures for time-series ECG applications. Our results underscore the importance of transfer learning in ECG diagnosis, yet depending on the amount of available data, researchers may opt not to use it, considering the non-negligible cost associated with pre-training.</p></details> |  |

Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets.

| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see \url{https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm}).</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Disentanglement by Extracting Static Information From A Single Sequence Element](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18131v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental representation learning tasks is unsupervised sequential disentanglement, where latent codes of inputs are decomposed to a single static factor and a sequence of dynamic factors. To extract this latent information, existing methods condition the static and dynamic codes on the entire input sequence. Unfortunately, these models often suffer from information leakage, i.e., the dynamic vectors encode both static and dynamic information, or vice versa, leading to a non-disentangled representation. Attempts to alleviate this problem via reducing the dynamic dimension and auxiliary loss terms gain only partial success. Instead, we propose a novel and simple architecture that mitigates information leakage by offering a simple and effective subtraction inductive bias while conditioning on a single sample. Remarkably, the resulting variational framework is simpler in terms of required loss terms, hyperparameters, and data augmentation. We evaluate our method on multiple data-modality benchmarks including general time series, video, and audio, and we show beyond state-of-the-art results on generation and prediction tasks in comparison to several strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024; The first four authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Physiological Signals Representation Learning via Multiscale Contrasting for Depression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16968v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depression recognition based on physiological signals such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) has made considerable progress. However, most existing studies ignore the complementarity and semantic consistency of multimodal physiological signals under the same stimulation task in complex spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal physiological signals representation learning framework using Siamese architecture via multiscale contrasting for depression recognition (MRLMC). First, fNIRS and EEG are transformed into different but correlated data based on a time-domain data augmentation strategy. Then, we design a spatio-temporal contrasting module to learn the representation of fNIRS and EEG through weight-sharing multiscale spatio-temporal convolution. Furthermore, to enhance the learning of semantic representation associated with stimulation tasks, a semantic consistency contrast module is proposed, aiming to maximize the semantic similarity of fNIRS and EEG. Extensive experiments on publicly available and self-collected multimodal physiological signals datasets indicate that MRLMC outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, our proposed framework is capable of transferring to multimodal time series downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Changen2: Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Generative Change Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17998v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our understanding of the temporal dynamics of the Earth's surface has been advanced by deep vision models, which often require lots of labeled multi-temporal images for training. However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic, alleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a probabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a GPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time series of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled single-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing foundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific foundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability. Experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g., Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time series of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained models exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to 3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to fully supervised counterparts) and transferability across multiple types of change tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The enhanced extension of our ICCV 2023 (Changen)</p></details> |

This combination allows for a more comprehensive and flexible representation of sequential and temporal data. We demonstrate through studies that our SigKANs with learnable path signatures perform better than conventional methods across a range of function approximation challenges.

Traditional approaches assume a stationary causal graph, which can be adapted to nonstationary time series with time-dependent effects or heterogeneous noise. In this work we address nonstationarity via regime-dependent causal structures. We first establish identifiability for high-order Markov Switching Models, which provide the foundations for identifiable regime-dependent causal discovery. Our empirical studies demonstrate the scalability of our proposed approach for high-order regime-dependent structure estimation, and we illustrate its applicability on brain activity data.</p></details> | <details><summary>CI4TS...</summary><p>CI4TS Workshop @UAI2024</p></details> |

A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a \emph{non-conformity score function} that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. While prior work has gone into creating score functions that produce multi-model prediction regions, such regions are generally too complex for use in downstream planning and control problems. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized \emph{shape template functions} over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are \emph{multi-modal}, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and \emph{practical}, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to $68\%$ reduction in prediction region area compared to a circular baseline region.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to L4DC 2024. 14 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17627v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to ensure autonomous vehicles are safe for on-road deployment, simulation-based testing has become an integral complement to on-road testing. The rise in simulation testing and validation reflects a growing need to verify that AV behavior is consistent with desired outcomes even in edge case scenarios $-$ which may seldom or never appear in on-road testing data. This raises a critical question: to what extent are AV failures in simulation consistent with data collected from real-world testing? As a result of the gap between simulated and real sensor data (sim-to-real gap), failures in simulation can either be spurious (simulation- or simulator-specific issues) or relevant (safety-critical AV system issues). One possible method for validating if simulated time series failures are consistent with real world time series sensor data could involve retrieving instances of the failure scenario from a real-world time series dataset, in order to understand AV performance in these scenarios. Adopting this strategy, we propose a formal definition of what constitutes a match between a real-world labeled time series data item and a simulated scenario written from a fragment of the Scenic probabilistic programming language for simulation generation. With this definition of a match, we develop a querying algorithm that identifies the subset of a labeled time series dataset matching a given scenario. To allow this approach to be used to verify the safety of other cyber-physical systems (CPS), we present a definition and algorithm for matching scalable beyond the autonomous vehicles domain. Experiments demonstrate the precision and scalability of the algorithm for a set of challenging and uncommon time series scenarios identified from the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset. We include a full system implementation of the querying algorithm freely available for use across a wide range of CPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 6 figures, 5 algorithms.

This potential is currently hampered by a lack of comprehensible benchmarks for multivariate time series anomaly detection, especially for the challenging case of satellite telemetry. The European Space Agency Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in Satellite Telemetry (ESA-ADB) aims to address this challenge and establish a new standard in the domain. It is a result of close cooperation between spacecraft operations engineers from the European Space Agency (ESA) and machine learning experts. The newly introduced ESA Anomalies Dataset contains annotated real-life telemetry from three different ESA missions, out of which two are included in ESA-ADB.

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution satellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |

State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of >10 different anomalies.

This study aims to (i) develop machine learning models from accelerometer data to classify the main behaviours of pre-weaned calves and (ii) set up a digital tool for monitoring the behaviour of pre-weaned calves from the models' prediction. Thirty pre-weaned calves were equipped with a 3-D accelerometer attached to a neck-collar for two months and filmed simultaneously. The behaviours were annotated, resulting in 27.4 hours of observation aligned with the accelerometer data. The time-series were then split into 3 seconds windows. Two machine learning models were tuned using data from 80% of the calves: (i) a Random Forest model to classify between active and inactive behaviours using a set of 11 hand-craft features [model 1] and (ii) a RidgeClassifierCV model to classify between lying, running, drinking milk and other behaviours using ROCKET features [model 2]. The performance of the models was tested using data from the remaining 20% of the calves. Model 1 achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.92. Model 2 achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.84. Behavioural metrics such as daily activity ratio and episodes of running, lying, drinking milk, and other behaviours expressed over time were deduced from the predictions. All the development was finally embedded into a Python dashboard so that the individual calf metrics could be displayed directly from the raw accelerometer files.</p></details> |  |

However, this capability remains largely under explored within existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), hindering their capacity to learn the fundamental principles of how things operate and the intentions behind the observed subjects. To address this issue, we introduce the integration of future modeling into the existing learning frameworks of MLLMs. By utilizing the subject trajectory, a highly structured representation of a consecutive frame sequence, as a learning objective, we aim to bridge the gap between the past and the future. We propose two innovative methods to empower MLLMs with foresight minds, Foresight Pre-Training (FPT) and Foresight Instruction-Tuning (FIT), which are inspired by the modern learning paradigm of LLMs. Specifically, FPT jointly training various tasks centered on trajectories, enabling MLLMs to learn how to attend and predict entire trajectories from a given initial observation. Then, FIT requires MLLMs to first predict trajectories of related objects and then reason about potential future events based on them. Aided by FPT and FIT, we build a novel and unified MLLM named Merlin that supports multi-images input and analysis about potential actions of multiple objects for the future reasoning. Experimental results show Merlin powerful foresight minds with impressive performance on both future reasoning and visual comprehension tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024.

Humans have a self-awareness process that allows us to recognize what we don't know when faced with queries. Inspired by this, our paper investigates whether LLMs can estimate their own hallucination risk before response generation. We analyze the internal mechanisms of LLMs broadly both in terms of training data sources and across 15 diverse Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, spanning over 700 datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals two key insights: (1) LLM internal states indicate whether they have seen the query in training data or not; and (2) LLM internal states show they are likely to hallucinate or not regarding the query. Our study explores particular neurons, activation layers, and tokens that play a crucial role in the LLM perception of uncertainty and hallucination risk. By a probing estimator, we leverage LLM self-assessment, achieving an average hallucination estimation accuracy of 84.32\% at run time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evaluation as a Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03234v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When LLMs are deployed in sensitive, human-facing settings, it is crucial that they do not output unsafe, biased, or privacy-violating outputs. For this reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe prompts such as "Tell me how to build a bomb." We find that, despite these safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted, overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the importance of developing more robust alignment methods.

| **[Evaluating LLMs' Inherent Multi-hop Reasoning Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11924v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, their multi-step reasoning abilities on multiple evidence integration on Multi-hop QA tasks remain underexplored. LLMs sometimes generate answers that rely on internal memory rather than reasoning given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation quality of real reasoning abilities. The counterfactual QA task can separate internal memory from reasoning abilities, but focusing solely on final-QA performance without evaluating the multi-step reasoning process is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning abilities. Current Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are factual and annotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for multi-step reasoning evaluation, showing limitations due to potential data contamination in LLMs pre-training stage. To address this issue, we introduce the Inherent Reasoning Evaluation (IRE) method, a novel evaluation way that jointly evaluates the LLMs' chain-of-reasoning performance based on the first knowledge-edited counterfactual multi-hop QA data which involves editing the original Wikipedia passages, reducing data contamination risks. The IRE comprehensively assesses reasoning chains through sub-QA and final-QA evaluations. Our comparisons reveal significant performance gaps for several LLMs between Wikipedia-based benchmarks and IRE, deeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks. We believe that the IRE benchmark will enhance and facilitate trustworthy LLM evaluations.</p></details> |  |

While a wide body of work examines the impact of quantized LLMs on English tasks, none have examined the effect of quantization across languages. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantized multilingual LLMs, focusing on their performance across languages and at varying scales. We use automatic benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge methods, and human evaluation, finding that (1) harmful effects of quantization are apparent in human evaluation, and automatic metrics severely underestimate the detriment: a 1.7% average drop in Japanese across automatic tasks corresponds to a 16.0% drop reported by human evaluators on realistic prompts; (2) languages are disparately affected by quantization, with non-Latin script languages impacted worst; and (3) challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning degrade fastest. As the ability to serve low-compute models is critical for wide global adoption of NLP technologies, our results urge consideration of multilingual performance as a key evaluation criterion for efficient models.</p></details> |  |

One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data. This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%. We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Such tasks typically require multi-hop reasoning, i.e., match natural language utterance with instances in the environment. Previous methods leverage LLMs to incrementally build a reasoning path, where the LLMs either invoke tools or pick up schemas by step-by-step interacting with the environment. We propose Reasoning-Path-Editing (Readi), a novel framework where LLMs can efficiently and faithfully reason over structured environments. In Readi, LLMs initially generate a reasoning path given a query, and edit the path only when necessary. We instantiate the path on structured environments and provide feedback to edit the path if anything goes wrong. Experimental results on three KGQA and two TableQA datasets show the effectiveness of Readi, significantly surpassing previous LLM-based methods (by 9.1% Hit@1 on WebQSP, 12.4% on MQA-3H and 9.5% on WTQ), comparable with state-of-the-art fine-tuned methods (67% on CWQ and 74.7% on WebQSP) and substantially boosting the vanilla LLMs (by 14.9% on CWQ).

In addition, they allow users to interact with the design processes through natural language instructions, thus making hardware design more accessible to developers. However, effectively leveraging LLMs in hardware design necessitates providing domain-specific data during inference (e.g., through in-context learning), fine-tuning, or pre-training. Unfortunately, existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in hardware design tasks. To address this issue, we first propose a set of criteria for creating high-quality hardware datasets that can effectively enhance LLM-assisted hardware design. Based on these criteria, we propose a Multi-Grained-Verilog (MG-Verilog) dataset, which encompasses descriptions at various levels of detail and corresponding code samples. To benefit the broader hardware design community, we have developed an open-source infrastructure that facilitates easy access, integration, and extension of the dataset to meet specific project needs. Furthermore, to fully exploit the potential of the MG-Verilog dataset, which varies in complexity and detail, we introduce a balanced fine-tuning scheme. This scheme serves as a unique use case to leverage the diverse levels of detail provided by the dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dataset and fine-tuning scheme consistently improve the performance of LLMs in hardware design tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ISLAD 2024</p></details> |

This adaptive behavior, which we refer to as self-restraint, is non-trivial to teach since it depends on the internal knowledge of an LLM. By default, LLMs are trained to maximize the next token likelihood, which does not teach the model to modulate its answer based on its level of uncertainty. In order to learn self-restraint, we devise a utility function that can encourage the model to produce responses only when it is confident in them. This utility function can be used to score generation of different length and abstention. To optimize this function, we introduce ReSearch, a process of "self-reflection" consisting of iterative self-prompting and self-evaluation. We use the ReSearch algorithm to generate synthetic data on which we finetune our models. Compared to their original versions, our resulting models generate fewer \emph{hallucinations} overall at no additional inference cost, for both known and unknown topics, as the model learns to selectively restrain itself. In addition, our method elegantly incorporates the ability to abstain by augmenting the samples generated by the model during the search procedure with an answer expressing abstention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03157v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[LLMs' Classification Performance is Overclaimed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16203v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as "which of the following is correct?" This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks? In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Oracle Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12213v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary AI applications leverage large language models (LLMs) to harness their knowledge and reasoning abilities for natural language processing tasks. This approach shares similarities with the concept of oracle Turing machines (OTMs). To capture the broader potential of these computations, including those not yet realized, we propose an extension to OTMs: the LLM-oracle machine (LLM-OM), by employing a cluster of LLMs as the oracle. Each LLM acts as a black box, capable of answering queries within its expertise, albeit with a delay. We introduce four variants of the LLM-OM: basic, augmented, fault-avoidance, and $\epsilon$-fault. The first two are commonly observed in existing AI applications. The latter two are specifically designed to address the challenges of LLM hallucinations, biases, and inconsistencies, aiming to ensure reliable outcomes.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach the safety protocols of LLMs. To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated with safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts. However, malicious users often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs. To uncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale conversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to bypass the system's defenses. This task is highly challenging due to the immense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak prompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for identifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. We have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level. Group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in previous research and attack success rates. Conversation-level analysis facilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. Turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBiscuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBiscuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\"ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p></details> | Preprint |

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09834v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora, have shown effectiveness in generating code completions. However, in LLM-based code completion, LLMs may struggle to use correct and up-to-date Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) due to the rapid and continuous evolution of libraries. While existing studies have highlighted issues with predicting incorrect APIs, the specific problem of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we conducted the first evaluation study on deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion. This study involved seven advanced LLMs, 145 API mappings from eight popular Python libraries, and 28,125 completion prompts. The study results reveal the \textit{status quo} and \textit{root causes} of deprecated API usage in LLM-based code completion from the perspectives of \textit{model}, \textit{prompt}, and \textit{library}. Based on these findings, we propose two lightweight fixing approaches, \textsc{ReplaceAPI} and \textsc{InsertPrompt}, which can serve as baseline approaches for future research on mitigating deprecated API usage in LLM-based completion. Additionally, we provide implications for future research on integrating library evolution with LLM-driven software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Capabilities of LLMs for Code Change Related Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02824v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers deal with code-change-related tasks daily, e.g., reviewing code. Pre-trained code and code-change-oriented models have been adapted to help developers with such tasks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown their effectiveness in code-related tasks. However, existing LLMs for code focus on general code syntax and semantics rather than the differences between two code versions. Thus, it is an open question how LLMs perform on code-change-related tasks. To answer this question, we conduct an empirical study using \textgreater 1B parameters LLMs on three code-change-related tasks, i.e., code review generation, commit message generation, and just-in-time comment update, with in-context learning (ICL) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT, including LoRA and prefix-tuning). We observe that the performance of LLMs is poor without examples and generally improves with examples, but more examples do not always lead to better performance. LLMs tuned with LoRA have comparable performance to the state-of-the-art small pre-trained models. Larger models are not always better, but \textsc{Llama~2} and \textsc{Code~Llama} families are always the best. The best LLMs outperform small pre-trained models on the code changes that only modify comments and perform comparably on other code changes. We suggest future work should focus more on guiding LLMs to learn the knowledge specific to the changes related to code rather than comments for code-change-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposition for Enhancing Attention: Improving LLM-based Text-to-SQL through Workflow Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10671v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning of large-language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in the field of natural language processing, while extensive case studies reveal that the single-step chain-of-thought prompting approach faces challenges such as attention diffusion and inadequate performance in complex tasks like text-to-SQL. To improve the contextual learning capabilities of LLMs in text-to-SQL, a workflow paradigm method is proposed, aiming to enhance the attention and problem-solving scope of LLMs through decomposition. Specifically, the information determination module for eliminating redundant information and the brand-new prompt structure based on problem classification greatly enhance the model's attention. Additionally, the inclusion of self-correction and active learning modules greatly expands the problem-solving scope of LLMs, hence improving the upper limit of LLM-based approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods by a significant margin. About 2-3 percentage point improvements compared to the existing baseline on the Spider Dev, Spider-Realistic, and Bird Dev datasets and new SOTA results on the Spider Test dataset are achieved. Our code is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/FlyingFeather/DEA-SQL}.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the capabilities of code LLMs in various aspects, many benchmarks have been proposed (e.g., HumanEval and ClassEval). Code reasoning is one of the most essential abilities of code LLMs, but existing benchmarks for code reasoning are not sufficient. Typically, they focus on predicting the input and output of a program, ignoring the evaluation of the intermediate behavior during program execution, as well as the logical consistency (e.g., the model should not give the correct output if the prediction of execution path is wrong) when performing the reasoning. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely REval, for evaluating code reasoning abilities and consistency of code LLMs with program execution. We utilize existing code benchmarks and adapt them to new benchmarks within our framework. A large-scale empirical study is conducted and most LLMs show unsatisfactory performance on both Runtime Behavior Reasoning (i.e., an average accuracy of 44.4%) and Incremental Consistency Evaluation (i.e., an average IC score of 10.3). Evaluation results of current code LLMs reflect the urgent need for the community to strengthen the code reasoning capability of code LLMs. Our code, data, and \newname leaderboard are available at https://r-eval.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2025 and this is our preprint version.

However, it has also raised some safety concerns regarding data protection, as videos can be more easily annotated, even without authorization. This paper introduces Video Watermarking, a novel technique to protect videos from unauthorized annotations by such video-based LLMs, especially concerning the video content and description, in response to specific queries. By imperceptibly embedding watermarks into key video frames with multi-modal flow-based losses, our method preserves the viewing experience while preventing misuse by video-based LLMs. Extensive experiments show that Video Watermarking significantly reduces the comprehensibility of videos with various video-based LLMs, demonstrating both stealth and robustness. In essence, our method provides a solution for securing video content, ensuring its integrity and confidentiality in the face of evolving video-based LLMs technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.13507</p></details> |
| **[Model-Enhanced LLM-Driven VUI Testing of VPA Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02791v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The flourishing ecosystem centered around voice personal assistants (VPA), such as Amazon Alexa, has led to the booming of VPA apps. The largest app market Amazon skills store, for example, hosts over 200,000 apps. Despite their popularity, the open nature of app release and the easy accessibility of apps also raise significant concerns regarding security, privacy and quality. Consequently, various testing approaches have been proposed to systematically examine VPA app behaviors. To tackle the inherent lack of a visible user interface in the VPA app, two strategies are employed during testing, i.e., chatbot-style testing and model-based testing. The former often lacks effective guidance for expanding its search space, while the latter falls short in interpreting the semantics of conversations to construct precise and comprehensive behavior models for apps. In this work, we introduce Elevate, a model-enhanced large language model (LLM)-driven VUI testing framework. Elevate leverages LLMs' strong capability in natural language processing to compensate for semantic information loss during model-based VUI testing. It operates by prompting LLMs to extract states from VPA apps' outputs and generate context-related inputs. During the automatic interactions with the app, it incrementally constructs the behavior model, which facilitates the LLM in generating inputs that are highly likely to discover new states. Elevate bridges the LLM and the behavior model with innovative techniques such as encoding behavior model into prompts and selecting LLM-generated inputs based on the context relevance. Elevate is benchmarked on 4,000 real-world Alexa skills, against the state-of-the-art tester Vitas. It achieves 15% higher state space coverage compared to Vitas on all types of apps, and exhibits significant advancement in efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

In this work, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) underperform in this domain due to challenges in understanding case complexities and distinguishing between similar charges. To adapt LLMs for effective legal judgment prediction, we introduce the Ask-Discriminate-Predict (ADAPT) reasoning framework inspired by human judicial reasoning. ADAPT involves decomposing case facts, discriminating among potential charges, and predicting the final judgment. We further enhance LLMs through fine-tuning with multi-task synthetic trajectories to improve legal judgment prediction accuracy and efficiency under our ADAPT framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in legal judgment prediction, particularly when dealing with complex and confusing charges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Reward Models for LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13210v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure that large language model (LLM) responses are helpful and non-toxic, a reward model trained on human preference data is usually used. LLM responses with high rewards are then selected through best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling or the LLM is further optimized to produce responses with high rewards through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these processes are susceptible to reward overoptimization or `hacking', where responses receive high rewards due to imperfections in the reward model rather than true preference, particularly as prompts or responses deviate from the training data. To address these challenges, we propose to train a Bayesian reward model, which signals higher uncertainty further from the training data distribution. We trained Bayesian reward models using Laplace approximation on LoRA weights, and found that the resulting uncertainty estimates can effectively mitigate reward overoptimization in BoN sampling.</p></details> |  |

In the face of a shortage of mental health professionals and offline resources, online short-form video content has grown to serve as a crucial conduit for disseminating mental health help and resources. However, the ease of content creation and access also contributes to the spread of misinformation, posing risks to accurate diagnosis and treatment. Detecting and understanding engagement with such content is crucial to mitigating their harmful effects on public health. We perform the first quantitative study of the phenomenon using YouTube Shorts and Bitchute as the sites of study. We contribute MentalMisinfo, a novel labeled mental health misinformation (MHMisinfo) dataset of 739 videos (639 from Youtube and 100 from Bitchute) and 135372 comments in total, using an expert-driven annotation schema. We first found that few-shot in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) are effective in detecting MHMisinfo videos. Next, we discover distinct and potentially alarming linguistic patterns in how audiences engage with MHMisinfo videos through commentary on both video-sharing platforms. Across the two platforms, comments could exacerbate prevailing stigma with some groups showing heightened susceptibility to and alignment with MHMisinfo. We discuss technical and public health-driven adaptive solutions to tackling the "epidemic" of mental health misinformation online.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, in submission to ICWSM</p></details> |

This method effectively combines edge devices and LLMs to help elderly people in their daily activities, such as reminding them to take pills or handling emergencies like falls. The LLM-based edge device can also serve as an interface to interact with elderly people, especially with memory issue, assisting them in their daily lives. By deploying such a system, we believe that the smart sensing system can improve the quality of life for older people and provide more efficient protection</p></details> |  |

Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding Alignment in Multimodal LLMs: A Comprehensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02477v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment has become a crucial component in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains comparatively underexplored. Similar to language models, MLLMs for image understanding tasks encounter challenges like hallucination. In MLLMs, hallucination can occur not only by stating incorrect facts but also by producing responses that are inconsistent with the image content. A primary objective of alignment for MLLMs is to encourage these models to align responses more closely with image information. Recently, multiple works have introduced preference datasets for MLLMs and examined different alignment methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, due to variations in datasets, base model types, and alignment methods, it remains unclear which specific elements contribute most significantly to the reported improvements in these works. In this paper, we independently analyze each aspect of preference alignment in MLLMs. We start by categorizing the alignment algorithms into two groups, offline (such as DPO), and online (such as online-DPO), and show that combining offline and online methods can improve the performance of the model in certain scenarios. We review a variety of published multimodal preference datasets and discuss how the details of their construction impact model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a novel way of creating multimodal preference data called Bias-Driven Hallucination Sampling (BDHS) that needs neither additional annotation nor external models, and show that it can achieve competitive performance to previously published alignment work for multimodal models across a range of benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite widespread adoption, the vast majority of work to-date has focused on first-class citizen languages like English and Chinese. This captures a small fraction of the languages in the world, but also makes it unclear which aspects of current state-of-the-art research transfer to a multilingual setting. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study to achieve a new state-of-the-art in aligning multilingual LLMs. We introduce a novel, scalable method for generating high-quality multilingual feedback data to balance data coverage. We establish the benefits of cross-lingual transfer and increased dataset size in preference training. Our preference-trained model achieves a 54.4% win-rate against Aya 23 8B, the current state-of-the-art multilingual LLM in its parameter class, and a 69.5% win-rate or higher against widely used models like Gemma-1.1-7B-it, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3. As a result of our study, we expand the frontier of alignment techniques to 23 languages covering half of the world's population.</p></details> |  |

Typically, MLLMs adopt a simple MLP to preserve all visual contexts via one-to-one transformation. However, the visual tokens are redundant and can be considerably increased when dealing with high-resolution images, impairing the efficiency of MLLMs significantly. Some recent works have introduced resampler or abstractor to reduce the number of resulting visual tokens. Unfortunately, they fail to capture finer details and undermine the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. In this work, we propose a novel visual projector, which adopts a coarse-to-fine scheme to inject the enriched characteristics to generate the condensed visual tokens. In specific, we first interpolate the visual features as a low-resolution point query, providing the overall visual representation as the foundation. Then, we introduce a region-to-point injection module that utilizes high-resolution, multi-level region-based cues as fine-grained reference keys and values, allowing them to be fully absorbed within the corresponding local context region. This step effectively updates the coarse point query, transforming it into an enriched one for the subsequent LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach compresses the visual tokens by 75%~89%, while achieves comparable or even better performance across diverse benchmarks with significantly higher efficiency.

We propose Pelican -- a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification. Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates. These sub-claims consist of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph. We then use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools. Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification. We finally use reasoning abilities of LLM to verify the correctness of the the claim by considering the consistency and confidence of the (question, answer) pairs from each sub-claim. Our experiments reveal a drop in hallucination rate by $\sim$8%-32% across various baseline LVLMs and a 27% drop compared to approaches proposed for hallucination mitigation on MMHal-Bench. Results on two other benchmarks further corroborate our results.</p></details> |  |

Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and null-checking conditions to find unreleased resources, suffering from both (1) false negatives caused by the incompleteness of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs and (2) false positives caused by the incompleteness of resource reachability validation identification. To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages the exceptional code comprehension capability of large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code. InferROI first prompts the LLM to infer involved intentions for a given code snippet, and then incorporates a two-stage static analysis approach to check control-flow paths for resource leak detection based on the inferred intentions. We evaluate the effectiveness of InferROI in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection. Experimental results on the DroidLeaks and JLeaks datasets demonstrate InferROI achieves promising bug detection rate (59.3% and 64.8%) and false alarm rate (18.6% and 24.0%). Compared to three industrial static detectors, InferROI detects 14~45 and 167~503 more bugs in DroidLeaks and JLeaks, respectively. When applied to real-world open-source projects, InferROI identifies 26 unknown resource leak bugs, with 7 of them being confirmed by developers. Finally, manual annotation indicated that InferROI achieved a precision of 74.6% and a recall of 81.8% in intention inference, covering more than 60% resource types involved in the datasets. The results of an ablation study underscores the importance of combining LLM-based inference with static analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Ability of LLMs to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02310v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process mining community has recently recognized the potential of large language models (LLMs) for tackling various process mining tasks. Initial studies report the capability of LLMs to support process analysis and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This latter property suggests that LLMs could also be used to tackle process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process behavior. Examples of such tasks include (semantic) anomaly detection and next activity prediction, which both involve considerations of the meaning of activities and their inter-relations. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to tackle such semantics-aware process mining tasks. Furthermore, whereas most works on the intersection of LLMs and process mining only focus on testing these models out of the box, we provide a more principled investigation of the utility of LLMs for process mining, including their ability to obtain process mining knowledge post-hoc by means of in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define three process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process semantics and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for each of them. Our evaluation experiments reveal that (1) LLMs fail to solve challenging process mining tasks out of the box and when provided only a handful of in-context examples, (2) but they yield strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks, consistently surpassing smaller, encoder-based language models.</p></details> | Submitted to ICPM |
| **[A Quantitative and Qualitative Evaluation of LLM-Based Explainable Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05487v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault Localization (FL), in which a developer seeks to identify which part of the code is malfunctioning and needs to be fixed, is a recurring challenge in debugging. To reduce developer burden, many automated FL techniques have been proposed. However, prior work has noted that existing techniques fail to provide rationales for the suggested locations, hindering developer adoption of these techniques. With this in mind, we propose AutoFL, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based FL technique that generates an explanation of the bug along with a suggested fault location. AutoFL prompts an LLM to use function calls to navigate a repository, so that it can effectively localize faults over a large software repository and overcome the limit of the LLM context length. Extensive experiments on 798 real-world bugs in Java and Python reveal AutoFL improves method-level acc@1 by up to 233.3% over baselines. Furthermore, developers were interviewed on their impression of AutoFL-generated explanations, showing that developers generally liked the natural language explanations of AutoFL, and that they preferred reading a few, high-quality explanations instead of many.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2024)</p></details> |

The impact of this surge in AIGC on IR systems remains an open question, with the primary challenge being the lack of a dedicated benchmark for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Cocktail, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for evaluating IR models in this mixed-sourced data landscape of the LLM era. Cocktail consists of 16 diverse datasets with mixed human-written and LLM-generated corpora across various text retrieval tasks and domains. Additionally, to avoid the potential bias from previously included dataset information in LLMs, we also introduce an up-to-date dataset, named NQ-UTD, with queries derived from recent events. Through conducting over 1,000 experiments to assess state-of-the-art retrieval models against the benchmarked datasets in Cocktail, we uncover a clear trade-off between ranking performance and source bias in neural retrieval models, highlighting the necessity for a balanced approach in designing future IR systems. We hope Cocktail can serve as a foundational resource for IR research in the LLM era, with all data and code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/KID-22/Cocktail}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2024; Datasets Link: https://huggingface.co/IR-Cocktail</p></details> |
| **[How Reliable Are Automatic Evaluation Methods for Instruction-Tuned LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10770v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual transfer. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[LlamAr & GemmAr: Enhancing LLMs Through Arabic Instruction-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02147v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have greatly impacted the natural language processing (NLP) field, particularly for the English language. These models have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The success of language models largely depends on the availability of high-quality instruction datasets, which consist of detailed task descriptions and corresponding responses that are essential for training the models to accurately address a variety of prompts. However, the availability and quality of these resources vary by language. While models perform well in English, they often struggle with languages like Arabic, due to the lack of datasets for fine-tuning Arabic-specific tasks. To address this issue, we introduce InstAr-500k, a new Arabic instruction dataset created by generating and collecting content that covers several domains and instruction types. We then assess this dataset by fine-tuning two open-source models, Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-7B-IT, on several downstream tasks to scale improvements in their functionality. Based on multiple evaluations, our fine-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance on several Arabic NLP benchmarks. These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of our dataset in elevating the capabilities of language models for Arabic. Our instruction dataset bridges the performance gap between English and Arabic language models by providing resources that amplify Arabic NLP development. Building on this foundation, we developed two state-of-the-art models, LlamAr-8B and GemmAr-7B, which are specifically tuned to excel at a wide range of Arabic NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the area of data collection for instruction fine-tuning in machine translation remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present LexMatcher, a simple yet effective method for data curation, the design of which is driven by the coverage of senses found in bilingual dictionaries. The construction process comprises data retrieval from an existing corpus and data augmentation that supplements the infrequent senses of polysemous words. Utilizing LLaMA2 as our base model, our approach outperforms the established baselines on the WMT2022 test sets and also exhibits remarkable performance in tasks related to word sense disambiguation and specialized terminology translation. These results underscore the effectiveness of LexMatcher in enhancing LLM-based machine translation. The code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/ARIES-LM/Lexmatcher-MT.git.</p></details> |  |

Our work explores the potential of the Contact Hypothesis, a concept from social psychology for debiasing LLMs. We simulate various forms of social contact through LLM prompting to measure their influence on the model's biases, mirroring how intergroup interactions can reduce prejudices in social contexts. We create a dataset of 108,000 prompts following a principled approach replicating social contact to measure biases in three LLMs (LLaMA 2, Tulu, and NousHermes) across 13 social bias dimensions. We propose a unique debiasing technique, Social Contact Debiasing (SCD), that instruction-tunes these models with unbiased responses to prompts. Our research demonstrates that LLM responses exhibit social biases when subject to contact probing, but more importantly, these biases can be significantly reduced by up to 40% in 1 epoch of instruction tuning LLaMA 2 following our SCD strategy. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/chahatraj/breakingbias.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[GSM-Plus: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of LLMs as Mathematical Problem Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19255v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, there are increasing debates regarding whether these models truly understand and apply mathematical knowledge or merely rely on shortcuts for mathematical reasoning. One essential and frequently occurring evidence is that when the math questions are slightly changed, LLMs can behave incorrectly. This motivates us to evaluate the robustness of LLMs' math reasoning capability by testing a wide range of question variations. We introduce the adversarial grade school math (GSM-Plus) dataset, an extension of GSM8K augmented with various mathematical perturbations. Our experiments on 25 LLMs and 4 prompting techniques show that while LLMs exhibit different levels of math reasoning abilities, their performances are far from robust. In particular, even for problems that have been solved in GSM8K, LLMs can make mistakes when new statements are added or the question targets are altered. We also explore whether more robust performance can be achieved by composing existing prompting methods, in which we try an iterative method that generates and verifies each intermediate thought based on its reasoning goal and calculation result.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges. We leverage TriviaQA as a benchmark for assessing objective knowledge reasoning of LLMs and evaluate them alongside human annotations which we found to have a high inter-annotator agreement. Our study includes 9 judge models and 9 exam taker models -- both base and instruction-tuned. We assess the judge model's alignment across different model sizes, families, and judge prompts. Among other results, our research rediscovers the importance of using Cohen's kappa as a metric of alignment as opposed to simple percent agreement, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores. We find that both Llama-3 70B and GPT-4 Turbo have an excellent alignment with humans, but in terms of ranking exam taker models, they are outperformed by both JudgeLM-7B and the lexical judge Contains, which have up to 34 points lower human alignment. Through error analysis and various other studies, including the effects of instruction length and leniency bias, we hope to provide valuable lessons for using LLMs as judges in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mooncake: A KVCache-centric Disaggregated Architecture for LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00079v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mooncake is the serving platform for Kimi, a leading LLM service provided by Moonshot AI. It features a KVCache-centric disaggregated architecture that separates the prefill and decoding clusters. It also leverages the underutilized CPU, DRAM, and SSD resources of the GPU cluster to implement a disaggregated cache of KVCache. The core of Mooncake is its KVCache-centric scheduler, which balances maximizing overall effective throughput while meeting latency-related Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Unlike traditional studies that assume all requests will be processed, Mooncake faces challenges due to highly overloaded scenarios. To mitigate these, we developed a prediction-based early rejection policy. Experiments show that Mooncake excels in long-context scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, Mooncake can achieve up to a 525% increase in throughput in certain simulated scenarios while adhering to SLOs. Under real workloads, Mooncake's innovative architecture enables Kimi to handle 75% more requests.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

However, LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper investigates the performance of LLMs as decision-makers in the context of Dueling Bandits (DB). We first evaluate the performance of LLMs by comparing GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo against established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo, quickly identify the Condorcet winner, thus outperforming existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of weak regret. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to converge even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To overcome these issues, we introduce an LLM-augmented algorithm, IF-Enhanced LLM, which takes advantage of both in-context decision-making capabilities of LLMs and theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms. The design of such an algorithm sheds light on how to enhance trustworthiness for LLMs used in decision-making tasks where performance robustness matters. We show that IF-Enhanced LLM has theoretical guarantees on both weak and strong regret. Our experimental results validate that IF-Enhanced LLM is robust even with noisy and adversarial prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating Human Strategic Behavior: Comparing Single and Multi-agent LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08189v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When creating policies, plans, or designs for people, it is challenging for designers to foresee all of the ways in which people may reason and behave. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to simulate human reasoning. We extend this work by measuring LLMs ability to simulate strategic reasoning in the ultimatum game, a classic economics bargaining experiment. Experimental evidence shows human strategic reasoning is complex; people will often choose to punish other players to enforce social norms even at personal expense. We test if LLMs can replicate this behavior in simulation, comparing two structures: single LLMs and multi-agent systems. We compare their abilities to (1) simulate human-like reasoning in the ultimatum game, (2) simulate two player personalities, greedy and fair, and (3) create robust strategies that are logically complete and consistent with personality. Our evaluation shows that multi-agent systems are more accurate than single LLMs (88 percent vs. 50 percent) in simulating human reasoning and actions for personality pairs. Thus, there is potential to use LLMs to simulate human strategic reasoning to help decision and policy-makers perform preliminary explorations of how people behave in systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, we present Purple-teaming LLMs with Adversarial Defender training (PAD), a pipeline designed to safeguard LLMs by novelly incorporating the red-teaming (attack) and blue-teaming (safety training) techniques. In PAD, we automatically collect conversational data that cover the vulnerabilities of an LLM around specific safety risks in a self-play manner, where the attacker aims to elicit unsafe responses and the defender generates safe responses to these attacks. We then update both modules in a generative adversarial network style by training the attacker to elicit more unsafe responses and updating the defender to identify them and explain the unsafe reason. Experimental results demonstrate that PAD significantly outperforms existing baselines in both finding effective attacks and establishing a robust safe guardrail. Furthermore, our findings indicate that PAD excels in striking a balance between safety and overall model quality. We also reveal key challenges in safeguarding LLMs, including defending multi-turn attacks and the need for more delicate strategies to identify specific risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial Leviathan: Exploring Social Evolution of LLM Agents Through the Lens of Hobbesian Social Contract Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14373v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for computational social science research at scale. Building upon prior explorations of LLM agent design, our work introduces a simulated agent society where complex social relationships dynamically form and evolve over time. Agents are imbued with psychological drives and placed in a sandbox survival environment. We conduct an evaluation of the agent society through the lens of Thomas Hobbes's seminal Social Contract Theory (SCT). We analyze whether, as the theory postulates, agents seek to escape a brutish "state of nature" by surrendering rights to an absolute sovereign in exchange for order and security. Our experiments unveil an alignment: Initially, agents engage in unrestrained conflict, mirroring Hobbes's depiction of the state of nature. However, as the simulation progresses, social contracts emerge, leading to the authorization of an absolute sovereign and the establishment of a peaceful commonwealth founded on mutual cooperation. This congruence between our LLM agent society's evolutionary trajectory and Hobbes's theoretical account indicates LLMs' capability to model intricate social dynamics and potentially replicate forces that shape human societies. By enabling such insights into group behavior and emergent societal phenomena, LLM-driven multi-agent simulations, while unable to simulate all the nuances of human behavior, may hold potential for advancing our understanding of social structures, group dynamics, and complex human systems.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) has attracted growing attention, which provides citations to support the model's responses in RAG, so as to enhance the credibility of LLM-generated content and facilitate verification. Prior methods mainly adopt coarse-grained attributions, linking to passage-level references or providing paragraph-level citations. However, these methods still fall short in verifiability and require certain time costs for fact checking. This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim(Refer & Claim), which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step. Unlike traditional coarse-grained attribution, ReClaim allows the model to add sentence-level fine-grained citations to each answer sentence in long-form question-answering tasks. Our experiments encompass various training and inference methods and multiple LLMs, verifying the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages,2 figures |

To start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of passive inheritance of model properties by systematically studying the consequences of synthetic data integration. We provide one of the most comprehensive studies to-date of how the source of synthetic data shapes models' internal biases, calibration and generations' textual attributes and preferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear "neutral". which invites the question whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good. Our findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the models towards the properties we want at test time by exploiting the data generation process? This would have historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of collecting data with a specific characteristic or objective in mind. However, improvement in the quality of synthetic data, as well as a shift towards general-purpose models designed to follow a diverse way of instructions, means this question is timely. We propose active inheritance as a term to describe intentionally constraining synthetic data according to a non-differentiable objective. We demonstrate how active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of models towards desirable non-differentiable attributes, e.g. high lexical diversity or low toxicity.</p></details> |  |

More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic two-phase process of localization followed by repair, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (27.33%) and lowest cost (\$0.34) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.</p></details> |  |

Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, KaLLM workshop</p></details> |

The intermediate gloss annotations of videos aim to guide the translation process. In our work, we focus on {\em Gloss2Text} translation stage and propose several advances by leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), data augmentation, and novel label-smoothing loss function exploiting gloss translation ambiguities improving significantly the performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PHOENIX Weather 2014T dataset, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in {\em Gloss2Text} translation, indicating its efficacy in addressing sign language translation and suggesting promising avenues for future research and development.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Detecting and Reducing the Financial Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12713v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in financial analysis for interpreting complex market data and trends. However, their use is challenged by intrinsic biases (e.g., risk-preference bias) and a superficial understanding of market intricacies, necessitating a thorough assessment of their financial insight. To address these issues, we introduce Financial Bias Indicators (FBI), a framework with components like Bias Unveiler, Bias Detective, Bias Tracker, and Bias Antidote to identify, detect, analyze, and eliminate irrational biases in LLMs. By combining behavioral finance principles with bias examination, we evaluate 23 leading LLMs and propose a de-biasing method based on financial causal knowledge. Results show varying degrees of financial irrationality among models, influenced by their design and training. Models trained specifically on financial datasets may exhibit more irrationality, and even larger financial language models (FinLLMs) can show more bias than smaller, general models. We utilize four prompt-based methods incorporating causal debiasing, effectively reducing financial biases in these models. This work enhances the understanding of LLMs' bias in financial applications, laying the foundation for developing more reliable and rational financial analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating the output quality of such systems on long-context tasks remains challenging, as tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack lack complexity. In this work, we argue that summarization can play a central role in such evaluation. We design a procedure to synthesize Haystacks of documents, ensuring that specific \textit{insights} repeat across documents. The "Summary of a Haystack" (SummHay) task then requires a system to process the Haystack and generate, given a query, a summary that identifies the relevant insights and precisely cites the source documents. Since we have precise knowledge of what insights should appear in a haystack summary and what documents should be cited, we implement a highly reproducible automatic evaluation that can score summaries on two aspects - Coverage and Citation. We generate Haystacks in two domains (conversation, news), and perform a large-scale evaluation of 10 LLMs and corresponding 50 RAG systems. Our findings indicate that SummHay is an open challenge for current systems, as even systems provided with an Oracle signal of document relevance lag our estimate of human performance (56\%) by 10+ points on a Joint Score. Without a retriever, long-context LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus score below 20% on SummHay. We show SummHay can also be used to study enterprise RAG systems and position bias in long-context models. We hope future systems can equal and surpass human performance on SummHay.</p></details> |  |

It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations.

One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on how we define memorization. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the string itself -- in other words, if these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the limitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial view of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://locuslab.github.io/acr-memorization</p></details> |
| **[Model Generation with LLMs: From Requirements to UML Sequence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06371v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementing natural language (NL) requirements with graphical models can improve stakeholders' communication and provide directions for system design. However, creating models from requirements involves manual effort. The advent of generative large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT being a notable example, offers promising avenues for automated assistance in model generation. This paper investigates the capability of ChatGPT to generate a specific type of model, i.e., UML sequence diagrams, from NL requirements. We conduct a qualitative study in which we examine the sequence diagrams generated by ChatGPT for 28 requirements documents of various types and from different domains. Observations from the analysis of the generated diagrams have systematically been captured through evaluation logs, and categorized through thematic analysis. Our results indicate that, although the models generally conform to the standard and exhibit a reasonable level of understandability, their completeness and correctness with respect to the specified requirements often present challenges. This issue is particularly pronounced in the presence of requirements smells, such as ambiguity and inconsistency. The insights derived from this study can influence the practical utilization of LLMs in the RE process, and open the door to novel RE-specific prompting strategies targeting effective model generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRAI: Evaluating LLM Agents for Event Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01231v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems. Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale. Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability. To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events. Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles. We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting. We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>66 pa...</summary><p>66 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables; Website: https://mirai-llm.github.io/</p></details> |

Many previous studies exploit quantization methods to reduce LLM inference cost by reducing latency and memory consumption. Applying 2-bit single-precision weight quantization brings >3% accuracy loss, so the state-of-the-art methods use mixed-precision methods for LLMs (e.g. Llama2-7b, etc.) to improve the accuracy. However, challenges still exist: (1) Uneven distribution in weight matrix. (2) Large speed degradation by adding sparse outliers. (3) Time-consuming dequantization operations on GPUs. To tackle these challenges and enable fast and efficient LLM inference on GPUs, we propose the following techniques in this paper. (1) Intra-weight mixed-precision quantization. (2) Exclusive 2-bit sparse outlier with minimum speed degradation. (3) Asynchronous dequantization. We conduct extensive experiments on different model families (e.g. Llama3, etc.) and model sizes. We achieve 2.91-bit for each weight considering all scales/zeros for different models with negligible loss. As a result, with our 2/4/16 mixed-precision quantization for each weight matrix and asynchronous dequantization during inference, our design achieves an end-to-end speedup for Llama2-7b is 1.74x over the original model, and we reduce both runtime cost and total cost by up to 2.53x and 2.29x with less GPU requirements.</p></details> |  |

Manually typing on smartphones for note-taking could be distracting and increase cognitive load for users. While large language models (LLMs) are used to automatically generate summaries and highlights, the content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) may not match users' intentions without user input or interaction. Therefore, we propose an AI-copiloted augmented reality (AR) system, GazeNoter, to allow users to swiftly select diverse LLM-generated suggestions via gaze on an AR headset for real-time note-taking. GazeNoter leverages an AR headset as a medium for users to swiftly adjust the LLM output to match their intentions, forming a user-in-the-loop AI system for both within-context and beyond-context notes. We conducted two user studies to verify the usability of GazeNoter in attending speeches in a static sitting condition and walking meetings and discussions in a mobile walking condition, respectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Rethinking LLM-based Preference Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01085v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language model (LLM)-based preference evaluation has been widely adopted to compare pairs of model responses. However, a severe bias towards lengthy responses has been observed, raising concerns about the reliability of this evaluation method. In this work, we designed a series of controlled experiments to study the major impacting factors of the metric of LLM-based preference evaluation, i.e., win rate, and conclude that the win rate is affected by two axes of model response: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness, and the latter is length-dependent and can be represented by conditional entropy. We find that length impacts the existing evaluations by influencing information mass. However, a reliable evaluation metric should not only assess content quality but also ensure that the assessment is not confounded by extraneous factors such as response length. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective adjustment, AdapAlpaca, to the existing practice of win rate measurement. Specifically, by adjusting the lengths of reference answers to match the test model's answers within the same interval, we debias information mass relative to length, ensuring a fair model evaluation.</p></details> |  |

On mobile devices, the wealth of valuable, non-public data generated daily holds great promise for locally fine-tuning personalized LLMs, while maintaining privacy through on-device processing. However, the constraints of mobile device resources pose challenges to direct on-device LLM fine-tuning, mainly due to the memory-intensive nature of derivative-based optimization required for saving gradients and optimizer states. To tackle this, we propose employing derivative-free optimization techniques to enable on-device fine-tuning of LLM, even on memory-limited mobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate that the RoBERTa-large model and OPT-1.3B can be fine-tuned locally on the OPPO Reno 6 smartphone using around 4GB and 6.5GB of memory respectively, using derivative-free optimization techniques. This highlights the feasibility of on-device LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices, paving the way for personalized LLMs on resource-constrained devices while safeguarding data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL 2024 Workshop on Privacy in Natural Language Processing (PrivateNLP)</p></details> |

While Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding video content, they often face challenges in accurately pinpointing timestamps within videos, which limits their performance on VTG tasks. Therefore, to improve video LLMs' ability to effectively locate timestamps, we argue that two critical aspects need to be enhanced. First, it is essential to have high-quality instructional tuning datasets that encompass mainstream VTG tasks. Second, directly incorporating timestamp knowledge into video LLMs is crucial, as it enables models to efficiently comprehend timestamp information. To address these needs, we first introduce VTG-IT-120K, a high-quality and comprehensive instruction tuning dataset that covers VTG tasks such as moment retrieval, dense video captioning, video summarization, and video highlight detection. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed video LLM model for VTG tasks, VTG-LLM, which (1) effectively integrates timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporates absolute-time tokens that specifically handle timestamp knowledge, thereby avoiding concept shifts; and (3) introduces a lightweight, high-performance slot-based token compression method to facilitate the sampling of more video frames. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across various VTG tasks.

However, LLM-based robots are limited to simple, repetitive motions due to the poor integration between language models, robots, and the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLM-based autonomous manipulation through Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). The approach involves using a prompted GPT-4 language model to decompose high-level language commands into sequences of motions that can be executed by the robot. The system also employs a YOLO-based perception algorithm, providing visual cues to the LLM, which aids in planning feasible motions within the specific environment. Additionally, an HRC method is proposed by combining teleoperation and Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP), allowing the LLM-based robot to learn from human guidance. Real-world experiments have been conducted using the Toyota Human Support Robot for manipulation tasks. The outcomes indicate that tasks requiring complex trajectory planning and reasoning over environments can be efficiently accomplished through the incorporation of human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, they are not always correct due to the data sparsity in specific domain corpus, or the model's hallucination problems. Given this, how much should we trust the responses from LLMs? This paper presents a novel way to evaluate the uncertainty that captures the directional instability, by constructing a directional graph from entailment probabilities, and we innovatively conduct Random Walk Laplacian given the asymmetric property of a constructed directed graph, then the uncertainty is aggregated by the derived eigenvalues from the Laplacian process. We also provide a way to incorporate the existing work's semantics uncertainty with our proposed layer. Besides, this paper identifies the vagueness issues in the raw response set and proposes an augmentation approach to mitigate such a problem, we conducted extensive empirical experiments and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages main content, 5 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a more accurate evaluation metric, named CheckPoint, to assess whether LLM-based mobile agents reach essential points during their planning and reasoning steps.</p></details> |  |

More powerful models, though effective, come with higher expenses, while less capable models are more cost-effective. To address this dilemma, we propose several efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and a weaker LLM during inference, aiming to optimize the balance between cost and response quality. We develop a training framework for these routers leveraging human preference data and data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Our evaluation on widely-recognized benchmarks shows that our approach significantly reduces costs-by over 2 times in certain cases-without compromising the quality of responses. Interestingly, our router models also demonstrate significant transfer learning capabilities, maintaining their performance even when the strong and weak models are changed at test time. This highlights the potential of these routers to provide a cost-effective yet high-performance solution for deploying LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, an LLM acts as a game master in two scenarios: one with random game mechanics and another where it can choose between random or deliberate actions. As an example, we use blackjack because the action space nor strategies involve deception. We benchmark Llama3-70B, GPT-4-Turbo, and Mixtral in blackjack, comparing outcomes against expected distributions in fair play to determine if LLMs develop strategies favoring the "house." Our findings reveal that the LLMs exhibit significant deviations from fair play when given implicit randomness instructions, suggesting a tendency towards strategic manipulation in ambiguous scenarios. However, when presented with an explicit choice, the LLMs largely adhere to fair play, indicating that the framing of instructions plays a crucial role in eliciting or mitigating potentially deceptive behaviors in AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Resea...</summary><p>Research conducted at the Deception Detection Hackathon 2024 hosted by Apart & Apollo Research</p></details> |

This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2024 GAAMAL</p></details> |

Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions.

In this work, we study approaches to identify LLM knowledge gaps and abstain from answering questions when knowledge gaps are present. We first adapt existing approaches to model calibration or adaptation through fine-tuning/prompting and analyze their ability to abstain from generating low-confidence outputs. Motivated by their failures in self-reflection and over-reliance on held-out sets, we propose two novel approaches that are based on model collaboration, i.e., LLMs probing other LLMs for knowledge gaps, either cooperatively or competitively. Extensive experiments with three LLMs on four QA tasks featuring diverse knowledge domains demonstrate that both cooperative and competitive approaches to unveiling LLM knowledge gaps achieve up to 19.3% improvements on abstain accuracy against the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals that our proposed mechanisms could help identify failure cases in retrieval augmentation and pinpoint knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

However, simulating sensitive interactions, such as in mental health, is challenging. Privacy concerns restrict data access, and collecting expert feedback, although vital, is laborious. To address this, we develop Roleplay-doh, a novel human-LLM collaboration pipeline that elicits qualitative feedback from a domain-expert, which is transformed into a set of principles, or natural language rules, that govern an LLM-prompted roleplay. We apply this pipeline to enable senior mental health supporters to create customized AI patients for simulated practice partners for novice counselors. After uncovering issues in GPT-4 simulations not adhering to expert-defined principles, we also introduce a novel principle-adherence prompting pipeline which shows 30\% improvements in response quality and principle following for the downstream task. Via a user study with 25 counseling experts, we demonstrate that the pipeline makes it easy and effective to create AI patients that more faithfully resemble real patients, as judged by creators and third-party counselors.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |

In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework, called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> |  |

However, they often encounter challenges when dealing with complex and dense prompts that involve multiple objects, attribute binding, and long descriptions. This paper proposes a framework called \textbf{LLM4GEN}, which enhances the semantic understanding ability of text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging the semantic representation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Through a specially designed Cross-Adapter Module (CAM) that combines the original text features of text-to-image models with LLM features, LLM4GEN can be easily incorporated into various diffusion models as a plug-and-play component and enhances text-to-image generation. Additionally, to facilitate the complex and dense prompts semantic understanding, we develop a LAION-refined dataset, consisting of 1 million (M) text-image pairs with improved image descriptions. We also introduce DensePrompts which contains 7,000 dense prompts to provide a comprehensive evaluation for the text-to-image generation task. With just 10\% of the training data required by recent ELLA, LLM4GEN significantly improves the semantic alignment of SD1.5 and SDXL, demonstrating increases of 7.69\% and 9.60\% in color on T2I-CompBench, respectively. The extensive experiments on DensePrompts also demonstrate that LLM4GEN surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in terms of sample quality, image-text alignment, and human evaluation.

The common retrievers like DPR normally work with 100-word Wikipedia paragraphs. Such a design forces the retriever to search over a large corpus to find the `needle' unit. In contrast, the readers only need to extract answers from the short retrieved units. Such an imbalanced `heavy' retriever and `light' reader design can lead to sub-optimal performance. In order to alleviate the imbalance, we propose a new framework LongRAG, consisting of a `long retriever' and a `long reader'. LongRAG processes the entire Wikipedia into 4K-token units, which is 30x longer than before. By increasing the unit size, we significantly reduce the total units from 22M to 700K. This significantly lowers the burden of retriever, which leads to a remarkable retrieval score: answer recall@1=71% on NQ (previously 52%) and answer recall@2=72% (previously 47%) on HotpotQA (full-wiki). Then we feed the top-k retrieved units ($\approx$ 30K tokens) to an existing long-context LLM to perform zero-shot answer extraction. Without requiring any training, LongRAG achieves an EM of 62.7% on NQ, which is the best known result. LongRAG also achieves 64.3% on HotpotQA (full-wiki), which is on par of the SoTA model. Our study offers insights into the future roadmap for combining RAG with long-context LLMs.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Results showed moderate-to-strong consistency of LLM annotation systems, improving further by lowering the model temperature. LLM annotations achieved close agreement with human expert annotations and outperformed the agreement between experts for UTAUT variables.

See More, Judge Better!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11629v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for judging the performance of LLMs has recently garnered attention. However, this type of approach is affected by the potential biases in LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of the evaluation results. To mitigate this issue, we propose and study two versions of many-shot in-context prompts, which rely on two existing settings of many-shot ICL for helping GPT-4o-as-a-Judge in single answer grading to mitigate the potential biases in LLMs, Reinforced ICL and Unsupervised ICL. Concretely, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated rationales, and the latter without. Based on the designed prompts, we investigate the impact of scaling the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the judgment results. Furthermore, we reveal the symbol bias hidden in the pairwise comparison of GPT-4o-as-a-Judge and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. Experimental results show that advanced long-context LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot regime. Meanwhile, the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of the symbol bias mitigation approach.</p></details> | work in progress |

Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce CLLM, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. However, not all the data generated by LLMs will improve downstream utility, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation mechanism, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of CLLM in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. Additionally, we provide insights into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024. *Seedat & Huynh contributed equally</p></details> |

As these tasks become increasingly complex, effective communication and collaboration among multiple robots become imperative to ensure successful completion. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable comprehension and planning abilities in the context of embodied agents. However, their application in household scenarios, specifically in the use of multiple agents collaborating to complete complex navigation tasks through communication, remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for decentralized multi-agent navigation, leveraging LLM-enabled communication and collaboration. By designing the communication-triggered dynamic leadership organization structure, we achieve faster team consensus with fewer communication instances, leading to better navigation effectiveness and collaborative exploration efficiency. With the proposed novel communication scheme, our framework promises to be conflict-free and robust in multi-object navigation tasks, even when there is a surge in team size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the RSS 2024 Workshop: GROUND</p></details> |
| **[Iterative Nash Policy Optimization: Aligning LLMs with General Preferences via No-Regret Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00617v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no-regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 41.5% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 38.3% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art iterative algorithm [Dong et al., 2024] under the BT model assumption. Additionally, our ablation study highlights the benefits of incorporating KL regularization for response length control.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge graphs(KGs) have been widely used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. However, KGs are known to be noisy and incomplete, which are hard to provide reliable explanations for recommendation results. An explainable recommender system is crucial for the product development and subsequent decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel recommender that synergies Large Language Models (LLMs) and KGs to enhance the recommendation and provide interpretable results. Specifically, we first harness the power of LLMs to augment KG reconstruction. LLMs comprehend and decompose user reviews into new triples that are added into KG. In this way, we can enrich KGs with explainable paths that express user preferences. To enhance the recommendation on augmented KGs, we introduce a novel subgraph reasoning module that effectively measures the importance of nodes and discovers reasoning for recommendation. Finally, these reasoning paths are fed into the LLMs to generate interpretable explanations of the recommendation results. Our approach significantly enhances both the effectiveness and interpretability of recommender systems, especially in cross-selling scenarios where traditional methods falter. The effectiveness of our approach has been rigorously tested on four open real-world datasets, with our methods demonstrating a superior performance over contemporary state-of-the-art techniques by an average improvement of 12%. The application of our model in a multinational engineering and technology company cross-selling recommendation system further underscores its practical utility and potential to redefine recommendation practices through improved accuracy and user trust.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the theory of "Learning from Errors", this framework employs an instructor LLM to meticulously analyze the specific errors within a target model, facilitating targeted and efficient training cycles. Within this framework, we implement two strategies: "Learning from Error," which focuses solely on incorrect responses to tailor training data, and "Learning from Error by Contrast", which uses contrastive learning to analyze both correct and incorrect responses for a deeper understanding of errors. Our empirical studies, conducted with several open-source models, demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, coding abilities, and factual knowledge. Notably, the refined Llama-3-8b-Instruction has outperformed ChatGPT, illustrating the effectiveness of our approach. By leveraging the strengths of both strategies, we have attained a more balanced performance improvement on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our code can be found at https://yingjiahao14.github.io/LLMs-as-Instructors-pages/.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Necessity and Viability of Low-Resource Bengali LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00416v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each new generation of English-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibits enhanced cross-lingual transfer capabilities and significantly outperforms older LLMs on low-resource languages. This prompts the question: Is there a need for LLMs dedicated to a particular low-resource language? We aim to explore this question for Bengali, a low-to-moderate resource Indo-Aryan language native to the Bengal region of South Asia. We compare the performance of open-weight and closed-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3 and GPT-4 against fine-tuned encoder-decoder models across a diverse set of Bengali downstream tasks, including translation, summarization, paraphrasing, question-answering, and natural language inference. Our findings reveal that while LLMs generally excel in reasoning tasks, their performance in tasks requiring Bengali script generation is inconsistent. Key challenges include inefficient tokenization of Bengali script by existing LLMs, leading to increased computational costs and potential performance degradation. Additionally, we highlight biases in machine-translated datasets commonly used for Bengali NLP tasks. We conclude that there is a significant need for a Bengali-oriented LLM, but the field currently lacks the high-quality pretraining and instruction-tuning datasets necessary to develop a highly effective model.</p></details> |  |

This study extends OEI to encompass multimodal inputs, underlining the significance of auditory cues in delivering emotional subtleties beyond the capabilities of text. We introduce a novel multimodal OEI (MOEI) task, integrating text and speech to mirror real-world scenarios. Utilizing CMU MOSEI and IEMOCAP datasets, we construct the CI-MOEI dataset. Additionally, Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is applied to the MPQA dataset to obtain the CIM-OEI dataset. We design a template for the OEI task to take full advantage of the generative power of large language models (LLMs). Advancing further, we propose an LLM-driven method STOEI, which combines speech and text modal to identify opinion expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that MOEI significantly improves the performance while our method outperforms existing methods by 9.20\% and obtains SOTA results.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 Figures, Accept by Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

To address these drawbacks, we propose Holmes-VAD, a novel framework that leverages precise temporal supervision and rich multimodal instructions to enable accurate anomaly localization and comprehensive explanations. Firstly, towards unbiased and explainable VAD system, we construct the first large-scale multimodal VAD instruction-tuning benchmark, i.e., VAD-Instruct50k. This dataset is created using a carefully designed semi-automatic labeling paradigm. Efficient single-frame annotations are applied to the collected untrimmed videos, which are then synthesized into high-quality analyses of both abnormal and normal video clips using a robust off-the-shelf video captioner and a large language model (LLM). Building upon the VAD-Instruct50k dataset, we develop a customized solution for interpretable video anomaly detection. We train a lightweight temporal sampler to select frames with high anomaly response and fine-tune a multimodal large language model (LLM) to generate explanatory content. Extensive experimental results validate the generality and interpretability of the proposed Holmes-VAD, establishing it as a novel interpretable technique for real-world video anomaly analysis. To support the community, our benchmark and model will be publicly available at https://holmesvad.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Teola: Towards End-to-End Optimization of LLM-based Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00326v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based applications consist of both LLM and non-LLM components, each contributing to the end-to-end latency. Despite great efforts to optimize LLM inference, end-to-end workflow optimization has been overlooked. Existing frameworks employ coarse-grained orchestration with task modules, which confines optimizations to within each module and yields suboptimal scheduling decisions. We propose fine-grained end-to-end orchestration, which utilizes task primitives as the basic units and represents each query's workflow as a primitive-level dataflow graph. This explicitly exposes a much larger design space, enables optimizations in parallelization and pipelining across primitives of different modules, and enhances scheduling to improve application-level performance. We build Teola, a novel orchestration framework for LLM-based applications that implements this scheme. Comprehensive experiments show that Teola can achieve up to 2.09x speedup over existing systems across various popular LLM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Generated Natural Language Meets Scaling Laws: New Explorations and Data Augmentation Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00322v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ascent of large language models (LLM), natural language processing has witnessed enhancements, such as LLM-based data augmentation. Nonetheless, prior research harbors two primary concerns: firstly, a lack of contemplation regarding whether the natural language generated by LLM (LLMNL) truly aligns with human natural language (HNL), a critical foundational question; secondly, an oversight that augmented data is randomly generated by LLM, implying that not all data may possess equal training value, that could impede the performance of classifiers. To address these challenges, we introduce the scaling laws to intrinsically calculate LLMNL and HNL. Through extensive experiments, we reveal slight deviations (approximately 0.2 Mandelbrot exponent) from Mandelbrot's law in LLMNL, underscore a complexity advantage in HNL, and supplement an interpretive discussion on language style. This establishes a solid foundation for LLM's expansion. Further, we introduce a novel data augmentation method for few-shot text classification, termed ZGPTDA, which leverages fuzzy computing mechanisms driven by the conformity to scaling laws to make decisions about GPT-4 augmented data. Extensive experiments, conducted in real-world scenarios, confirms the effectiveness (improving F1 of Bert and RoBerta by 7-10%) and competitiveness (surpassing recent AugGPT and GENCO methods by about 2% accuracy on DeBerta) of ZGPTDA. In addition, we reveal some interesting insights, e.g., Hilberg's law and Taylor's law can impart more benefits to text classification, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiteSearch: Efficacious Tree Search for LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00320v1)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research suggests that tree search algorithms (e.g. Monte Carlo Tree Search) can dramatically boost LLM performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks. However, they often require more than 10 times the computational resources of greedy decoding due to wasteful search strategies, making them difficult to be deployed in practical applications. This study introduces a novel guided tree search algorithm with dynamic node selection and node-level exploration budget (maximum number of children) calculation to tackle this issue. By considering the search progress towards the final answer (history) and the guidance from a value network (future) trained without any step-wise annotations, our algorithm iteratively selects the most promising tree node before expanding it within the boundaries of the allocated computational budget. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and TabMWP datasets demonstrate that our approach not only offers competitive performance but also enjoys significantly lower computational costs compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference between the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and explain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information. Our designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations to enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust transferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty estimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that a better uncertainty estimation mode leads to a better calibration performance. Furthermore, our method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model accessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

On one hand, LLMs excel at natural language processing but do not perform well on planning. On the other hand, classical planning tools excel at planning tasks but require input in a structured language such as the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages (7 main + 2 references + 11 appendix), 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

System 1, which is a quick, emotional, and intuitive process, which is subject to cognitive biases, and System 2, a slow, onerous, and deliberate process. NLP researchers often compare zero-shot prompting in LLMs to System 1 reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to System 2. In line with this interpretation, prior research has found that using CoT prompting in LLMs leads to reduced gender bias. We investigate the relationship between bias, CoT prompting, and dual process theory in LLMs directly. We compare zero-shot, CoT, and a variety of dual process theory-based prompting strategies on two bias datasets spanning nine different social bias categories. We also use human and machine personas to determine whether the effects of dual process theory in LLMs are based on modeling human cognition or inherent to the system. We find that a human persona, System 2, and CoT prompting all tend to reduce social biases in LLMs, though the best combination of features depends on the exact model and bias category -- resulting in up to a 13 percent drop in stereotypical judgments by an LLM.</p></details> |  |

Testing Privacy Implications of Language Models via Contextual Integrity Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17884v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interactive use of large language models (LLMs) in AI assistants (at work, home, etc.) introduces a new set of inference-time privacy risks: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose and with whom, within a given context. In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory of mind.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 ICLR Spotlight.

In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model (KG-LLM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph tasks. We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Experimental results show that KG-LLM significantly improves the models' generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions in unfamiliar scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we explore the potential of psychological profiling techniques, particularly focusing on the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and psycholinguistic features. We investigate the intersection of psychology and cybersecurity, discussing how LLMs can be employed to analyze textual data for identifying psychological traits of threat actors. We explore the incorporation of psycholinguistic features, such as linguistic patterns and emotional cues, into cybersecurity frameworks.

Automated test generation techniques have emerged to address this, but often lack readability and require developer intervention. Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT and Mistral, show promise in software engineering, including in test generation. However, their effectiveness remains unclear. This study conducts the first comprehensive investigation of LLMs, evaluating the effectiveness of four LLMs and five prompt engineering techniques, for unit test generation. We analyze 216\,300 tests generated by the selected advanced instruct-tuned LLMs for 690 Java classes collected from diverse datasets. We assess correctness, understandability, coverage, and bug detection capabilities of LLM-generated tests, comparing them to EvoSuite, a popular automated testing tool. While LLMs show potential, improvements in test correctness are necessary. This study reveals the strengths and limitations of LLMs compared to traditional methods, paving the way for further research on LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Through extensive experiments, we show that prompting-based rationales align better with human-annotated rationales than attribution-based rationales, and demonstrate reasonable alignment with humans even when model performance is poor. We additionally find that the faithfulness limitations of prompting-based methods, which are identified in previous work, may be linked to their collapsed predictions. By fine-tuning these models on the corresponding datasets, both prompting and attribution methods demonstrate improved faithfulness. Our study sheds light on more rigorous and fair evaluations of LLM rationales, especially for prompting-based ones.</p></details> |  |

To improve human evaluation ability and overcome that limitation this work trains "critic" models that help humans to more accurately evaluate model-written code. These critics are themselves LLMs trained with RLHF to write natural language feedback highlighting problems in code from real-world assistant tasks. On code containing naturally occurring LLM errors model-written critiques are preferred over human critiques in 63% of cases, and human evaluation finds that models catch more bugs than human contractors paid for code review. We further confirm that our fine-tuned LLM critics can successfully identify hundreds of errors in ChatGPT training data rated as "flawless", even though the majority of those tasks are non-code tasks and thus out-of-distribution for the critic model. Critics can have limitations of their own, including hallucinated bugs that could mislead humans into making mistakes they might have otherwise avoided, but human-machine teams of critics and contractors catch similar numbers of bugs to LLM critics while hallucinating less than LLMs alone.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. Further, we propose to maneuver Instruct-IPT with text instructions for better user interfaces.

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

| **[Using diffusion model as constraint: Empower Image Restoration Network Training with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration has made marvelous progress with the advent of deep learning. Previous methods usually rely on designing powerful network architecture to elevate performance, however, the natural visual effect of the restored results is limited by color and texture distortions. Besides the visual perceptual quality, the semantic perception recovery is an important but often overlooked perspective of restored image, which is crucial for the deployment in high-level tasks. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to resort these issues by introducing a naturalness-oriented and semantic-aware optimization mechanism, dubbed DiffLoss. Specifically, inspired by the powerful distribution coverage capability of the diffusion model for natural image generation, we exploit the Markov chain sampling property of diffusion model and project the restored results of existing networks into the sampling space. Besides, we reveal that the bottleneck feature of diffusion models, also dubbed h-space feature, is a natural high-level semantic space. We delve into this property and propose a semantic-aware loss to further unlock its potential of semantic perception recovery, which paves the way to connect image restoration task and downstream high-level recognition task. With these two strategies, the DiffLoss can endow existing restoration methods with both more natural and semantic-aware results. We verify the effectiveness of our method on substantial common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Code will be available at https://github.com/JosephTiTan/DiffLoss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising as Adaptation: Noise-Space Domain Adaptation for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18516v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning-based image restoration methods have made significant progress, they still struggle with limited generalization to real-world scenarios due to the substantial domain gap caused by training on synthetic data. Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIR: A Lightweight Baseline for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01368v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in Image Restoration based on CNN and transformer. However, the inherent characteristics of the Image Restoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to focus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model, leading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the efficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently restore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious structural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and global residual connections that are ignored by modern networks. Then, a Lightweight Adaptive Attention (LAA) Block is introduced which is mainly composed of proposed Adaptive Filters and Attention Blocks. The proposed Adaptive Filter is used to adaptively extract high-frequency information and enhance object contours in various IR tasks, and Attention Block involves a novel Patch Attention module to approximate the self-attention part of the transformer. On the deraining task, our LIR achieves the state-of-the-art Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). For denoising, dehazing, and deblurring tasks, LIR also achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with a parameter size of about 30\%. In addition, it is worth noting that our LIR produces better visual results that are more in line with the human aesthetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

| **[Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08853v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining \& dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration.

| **[Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Restorer: Solving Multiple Image Restoration Tasks with One Set of Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction.

Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

However, they require large amounts of computational power for training and inference. In this paper, we propose lightweight diffusion models for image inpainting that can be trained on a single image, or a few images. We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Test-Time Degradation Adaptation for Open-Set Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02197v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to close-set scenarios that restore images from a predefined set of degradations, open-set image restoration aims to handle the unknown degradations that were unforeseen during the pretraining phase, which is less-touched as far as we know. This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |
| **[Deep Block Proximal Linearised Minimisation Algorithm for Non-convex Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02458v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is typically addressed through non-convex inverse problems, which are often solved using first-order block-wise splitting methods. In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |
| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

| **[Efficient Degradation-aware Any Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15475v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing missing details from degraded low-quality inputs poses a significant challenge. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v5)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |

However, the curse of dimensionality in 3D medical data leads mainstream volume-wise methods to suffer from high resource consumption and challenges models to successfully capture the natural distribution, resulting in inevitable volume inconsistency and artifacts. Some recent works attempt to simplify generation in the latent space but lack the capability to efficiently model intricate image details. To address these limitations, we present Blaze3DM, a novel approach that enables fast and high-fidelity generation by integrating compact triplane neural field and powerful diffusion model. In technique, Blaze3DM begins by optimizing data-dependent triplane embeddings and a shared decoder simultaneously, reconstructing each triplane back to the corresponding 3D volume. To further enhance 3D consistency, we introduce a lightweight 3D aware module to model the correlation of three vertical planes. Then, diffusion model is trained on latent triplane embeddings and achieves both unconditional and conditional triplane generation, which is finally decoded to arbitrary size volume. Extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving, including sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, compressed-sensing MRI, and MRI isotropic super-resolution, demonstrate that Blaze3DM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also markedly improves computational efficiency over existing methods (22~40x faster than previous work).</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts.

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,10figures |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasizing Crucial Features for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11468v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. Although the existing methods have achieved promising performance by designing novelty architecture of module, they ignore the fact that different regions in a corrupted image undergo varying degrees of degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different regions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency attention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM consists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the frequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation location through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in the spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify the disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain. Additionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale block (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple simplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward block (MSFBlock). Finally, we propose our ECFNet, which integrates the aforementioned components into a U-shaped backbone for recovering high-quality images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFNet, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, in image restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models, all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, to be published on Chinese Physics C</p></details> |
| **[Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired image restoration method that views the image restoration problem as completing the finishing steps of a diffusion-based image generation task. RSCD uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the severity of image degradation and the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/restorative_step-calibrated_diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSDehamba: Lightweight Vision Mamba for Remote Sensing Satellite Image Dehazing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10030v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image dehazing (RSID) aims to remove nonuniform and physically irregular haze factors for high-quality image restoration. The emergence of CNNs and Transformers has taken extraordinary strides in the RSID arena. However, these methods often struggle to demonstrate the balance of adequate long-range dependency modeling and maintaining computational efficiency. To this end, we propose the first lightweight network on the mamba-based model called RSDhamba in the field of RSID. Greatly inspired by the recent rise of Selective State Space Model (SSM) for its superior performance in modeling linear complexity and remote dependencies, our designed RSDehamba integrates the SSM framework into the U-Net architecture. Specifically, we propose the Vision Dehamba Block (VDB) as the core component of the overall network, which utilizes the linear complexity of SSM to achieve the capability of global context encoding. Simultaneously, the Direction-aware Scan Module (DSM) is designed to dynamically aggregate feature exchanges over different directional domains to effectively enhance the flexibility of sensing the spatially varying distribution of haze. In this way, our RSDhamba fully demonstrates the superiority of spatial distance capture dependencies and channel information exchange for better extraction of haze features. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks validate the surpassing performance of our RSDehamba against existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The RAIM challenge constructed a benchmark for image restoration in the wild, including real-world images with/without reference ground truth in various scenarios from real applications. The participants were required to restore the real-captured images from complex and unknown degradation, where generative perceptual quality and fidelity are desired in the restoration result. The challenge consisted of two tasks. Task one employed real referenced data pairs, where quantitative evaluation is available. Task two used unpaired images, and a comprehensive user study was conducted. The challenge attracted more than 200 registrations, where 39 of them submitted results with more than 400 submissions. Top-ranked methods improved the state-of-the-art restoration performance and obtained unanimous recognition from all 18 judges.

| **[FRRffusion: Unveiling Authenticity with Diffusion-Based Face Retouching Reversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07582v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unveiling the real appearance of retouched faces to prevent malicious users from deceptive advertising and economic fraud has been an increasing concern in the era of digital economics. This article makes the first attempt to investigate the face retouching reversal (FRR) problem. We first collect an FRR dataset, named deepFRR, which contains 50,000 StyleGAN-generated high-resolution (1024*1024) facial images and their corresponding retouched ones by a commercial online API. To our best knowledge, deepFRR is the first FRR dataset tailored for training the deep FRR models. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-based FRR approach (FRRffusion) for the FRR task. Our FRRffusion consists of a coarse-to-fine two-stage network: A diffusion-based Facial Morpho-Architectonic Restorer (FMAR) is constructed to generate the basic contours of low-resolution faces in the first stage, while a Transformer-based Hyperrealistic Facial Detail Generator (HFDG) is designed to create high-resolution facial details in the second stage. Tested on deepFRR, our FRRffusion surpasses the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods by a large margin in four widespread quantitative metrics. Especially, the de-retouched images by our FRRffusion are visually much closer to the raw face images than both the retouched face images and those restored by the GP-UNIT and Stable Diffusion methods in terms of qualitative evaluation with 85 subjects. These results sufficiently validate the efficacy of our work, bridging the recently-standing gap between the FRR and generic image restoration tasks.

| **[Uncertainty Visualization via Low-Dimensional Posterior Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07804v2)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ill-posed inverse problems, it is commonly desirable to obtain insight into the full spectrum of plausible solutions, rather than extracting only a single reconstruction. Information about the plausible solutions and their likelihoods is encoded in the posterior distribution. However, for high-dimensional data, this distribution is challenging to visualize. In this work, we introduce a new approach for estimating and visualizing posteriors by employing energy-based models (EBMs) over low-dimensional subspaces. Specifically, we train a conditional EBM that receives an input measurement and a set of directions that span some low-dimensional subspace of solutions, and outputs the probability density function of the posterior within that space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across a diverse range of datasets and image restoration problems, showcasing its strength in uncertainty quantification and visualization. As we show, our method outperforms a baseline that projects samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, while being orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, it is more accurate than a baseline that assumes a Gaussian posterior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport: Towards Structure-Preserving Unpaired and Paired Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02843v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based image restoration methods generally struggle with faithfully preserving the structures of the original image. In this work, we propose a novel Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (RCOT) approach, which models image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for both unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a unique degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we first formalize a Fourier residual-guided OT objective by incorporating the degradation-specific information of the residual into the transport cost. We further design the transport map as a two-pass RCOT map that comprises a base model and a refinement process, in which the transport residual is computed by the base model in the first pass and then encoded as a degradation-specific embedding to condition the second-pass restoration. By duality, the RCOT problem is transformed into a minimax optimization problem, which can be solved by adversarially training neural networks. Extensive experiments on multiple restoration tasks show that RCOT achieves competitive performance in terms of both distortion measures and perceptual quality, restoring images with more faithful structures as compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

However, given the local nature of the convolutional operator, they struggle to capture global information. The promise of attention mechanisms in Transformers is to circumvent this problem, but it comes at the cost of intensive computational overhead. Many recent studies in image restoration have focused on solving the challenge of balancing performance and computational cost via Transformer variants. In this paper, we present CascadedGaze Network (CGNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that employs Global Context Extractor (GCE), a novel and efficient way to capture global information for image restoration. The GCE module leverages small kernels across convolutional layers to learn global dependencies, without requiring self-attention. Extensive experimental results show that our computationally efficient approach performs competitively to a range of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic image denoising and single image deblurring tasks, and pushes the performance boundary further on the real image denoising task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR), 2024. 20 pages</p></details> |

This challenge is to address a major challenge in the field of image and video processing, namely, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) for AI-Generated Content (AIGC). The challenge is divided into the image track and the video track. The image track uses the AIGIQA-20K, which contains 20,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 15 popular generative models.

Prevailing methods address distinct restoration tasks independently, leading to intricate systems and the incapability to harness the potential synergies of multi-task learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose DocRes, a generalist model that unifies five document image restoration tasks including dewarping, deshadowing, appearance enhancement, deblurring, and binarization. To instruct DocRes to perform various restoration tasks, we propose a novel visual prompt approach called Dynamic Task-Specific Prompt (DTSPrompt). The DTSPrompt for different tasks comprises distinct prior features, which are additional characteristics extracted from the input image. Beyond its role as a cue for task-specific execution, DTSPrompt can also serve as supplementary information to enhance the model's performance. Moreover, DTSPrompt is more flexible than prior visual prompt approaches as it can be seamlessly applied and adapted to inputs with high and variable resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DocRes achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art task-specific models. This underscores the potential of DocRes across a broader spectrum of document image restoration tasks.

Among these methods, semantic segmentation algorithms have demonstrated promising results in pixel-wise crack detection tasks. However, training such networks requires a large amount of human-annotated datasets with pixel-level annotations, which is a highly labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Moreover, supervised learning-based methods often struggle with poor generalizability in unseen datasets. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised pixel-wise road crack detection network, known as UP-CrackNet. Our approach first generates multi-scale square masks and randomly selects them to corrupt undamaged road images by removing certain regions. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network is trained to restore the corrupted regions by leveraging the semantic context learned from surrounding uncorrupted regions. During the testing phase, an error map is generated by calculating the difference between the input and restored images, which allows for pixel-wise crack detection. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UP-CrackNet outperforms other general-purpose unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, and exhibits satisfactory performance and superior generalizability when compared with state-of-the-art supervised crack segmentation algorithms. Our source code is publicly available at mias.group/UP-CrackNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Image Restoration For Image Anti-Forensics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02751v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image forensics is concerned with whether an image has been tampered with, image anti-forensics attempts to prevent image forensics methods from detecting tampered images. The competition between these two fields started long before the advancement of deep learning. JPEG compression, blurring and noising, which are simple methods by today's standards, have long been used for anti-forensics and have been the subject of much research in both forensics and anti-forensics. Although these traditional methods are old, they make it difficult to detect fake images and are used for data augmentation in training deep image forgery detection models. In addition to making the image difficult to detect, these methods leave traces on the image and consequently degrade the image quality. Separate image forensics methods have also been developed to detect these traces. In this study, we go one step further and improve the image quality after these methods with deep image restoration models and make it harder to detect the forged image. We evaluate the impact of these methods on image quality. We then test both our proposed methods with deep learning and methods without deep learning on the two best existing image manipulation detection models. In the obtained results, we show how existing image forgery detection models fail against the proposed methods. Code implementation will be publicly available at https://github.com/99eren99/DIRFIAF .</p></details> |  |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We proceed with the application of an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm for reconstructing the 3D model. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach using both synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them. Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise. It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model, we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration. Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks, namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI@2024.

It aims to mitigate compression artifacts caused by unknown quality factors, particularly with JPEG codecs. Existing works on blind CIR often seek assistance from a quality factor prediction network to facilitate their network to restore compressed images. However, the predicted numerical quality factor lacks spatial information, preventing network adaptability toward image contents. Recent studies in prompt-learning-based image restoration have showcased the potential of prompts to generalize across varied degradation types and degrees. This motivated us to design a prompt-learning-based compressed image restoration network, dubbed PromptCIR, which can effectively restore images from various compress levels. Specifically, PromptCIR exploits prompts to encode compression information implicitly, where prompts directly interact with soft weights generated from image features, thus providing dynamic content-aware and distortion-aware guidance for the restoration process. The light-weight prompts enable our method to adapt to different compression levels, while introducing minimal parameter overhead. Overall, PromptCIR leverages the powerful transformer-based backbone with the dynamic prompt module to proficiently handle blind CIR tasks, winning first place in the NTIRE 2024 challenge of blind compressed image enhancement track. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed PromptCIR.

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement with High-Low Frequency Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13537v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, due to a series of image degradations, obtaining high-quality, clear content photos is challenging. While significant progress has been made in synthesizing high-quality images, previous methods for image restoration and enhancement often overlooked the characteristics of different degradations. They applied the same structure to address various types of degradation, resulting in less-than-ideal restoration outcomes. Inspired by the notion that high/low frequency information is applicable to different degradations, we introduce HLNet, a Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement method based on high-low frequency decomposition. Specifically, we employ two modules for feature extraction: shared weight modules and non-shared weight modules. In the shared weight modules, we use SCConv to extract common features from different degradations. In the non-shared weight modules, we introduce the High-Low Frequency Decomposition Block (HLFDB), which employs different methods to handle high-low frequency information, enabling the model to address different degradations more effectively. Compared to other networks, our method takes into account the characteristics of different degradations, thus achieving higher-quality image restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR 2024 Workshop, code: https://github.com/chengeng0613/HLNet</p></details> |
| **[Face2Face: Label-driven Facial Retouching Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14177v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularity of social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, and the widespread availability and convenience of retouching tools, an increasing number of individuals are utilizing these tools to beautify their facial photographs. This poses challenges for fields that place high demands on the authenticity of photographs, such as identity verification and social media. By altering facial images, users can easily create deceptive images, leading to the dissemination of false information. This may pose challenges to the reliability of identity verification systems and social media, and even lead to online fraud. To address this issue, some work has proposed makeup removal methods, but they still lack the ability to restore images involving geometric deformations caused by retouching. To tackle the problem of facial retouching restoration, we propose a framework, dubbed Face2Face, which consists of three components: a facial retouching detector, an image restoration model named FaceR, and a color correction module called Hierarchical Adaptive Instance Normalization (H-AdaIN). Firstly, the facial retouching detector predicts a retouching label containing three integers, indicating the retouching methods and their corresponding degrees. Then FaceR restores the retouched image based on the predicted retouching label. Finally, H-AdaIN is applied to address the issue of color shift arising from diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and each module.</p></details> |  |

To achieve high-quality images, researchers have attempted various image restoration and enhancement operations on photographs, including denoising, deblurring, and high dynamic range imaging. However, merely performing a single type of image enhancement still cannot yield satisfactory images. In this paper, to deal with the challenge above, we propose the Composite Refinement Network (CRNet) to address this issue using multiple exposure images. By fully integrating information-rich multiple exposure inputs, CRNet can perform unified image restoration and enhancement. To improve the quality of image details, CRNet explicitly separates and strengthens high and low-frequency information through pooling layers, using specially designed Multi-Branch Blocks for effective fusion of these frequencies. To increase the receptive field and fully integrate input features, CRNet employs the High-Frequency Enhancement Module, which includes large kernel convolutions and an inverted bottleneck ConvFFN. Our model secured third place in the first track of the Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement Challenge, surpassing previous SOTA models in both testing metrics and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by CVPR2024 Workshop, Code: https://github.com/CalvinYang0/CRNet</p></details> |

Another issue is that most Transformer-based IR methods focus only on either local or global features, leading to limited receptive fields or deficient parameter issues. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight IR network, Reciprocal Attention Mixing Transformer (RAMiT). It employs our proposed dimensional reciprocal attention mixing Transformer (D-RAMiT) blocks, which compute bi-dimensional (spatial and channel) self-attentions in parallel with different numbers of multi-heads. The bi-dimensional attentions help each other to complement their counterpart's drawbacks and are then mixed. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical reciprocal attention mixing (H-RAMi) layer that compensates for pixel-level information losses and utilizes semantic information while maintaining an efficient hierarchical structure. Furthermore, we revisit and modify MobileNet V1 and V2 to attach efficient convolutions to our proposed components. The experimental results demonstrate that RAMiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple lightweight IR tasks, including super-resolution, color denoising, grayscale denoising, low-light enhancement, and deraining.

Although CNN and Transformer-based models are prevalent in this field, they exhibit inherent limitations, such as inadequate long-range dependency modeling and high computational costs. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Channel-Aware U-Shaped Mamba (CU-Mamba) model, which incorporates a dual State Space Model (SSM) framework into the U-Net architecture. CU-Mamba employs a Spatial SSM module for global context encoding and a Channel SSM component to preserve channel correlation features, both in linear computational complexity relative to the feature map size. Extensive experimental results validate CU-Mamba's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the importance of integrating both spatial and channel contexts in image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaIR: Exploiting Underlying Similarities of Image Restoration Tasks with Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11475v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image restoration approaches typically employ extensive networks specifically trained for designated degradations. Despite being effective, such methods inevitably entail considerable storage costs and computational overheads due to the reliance on task-specific networks. In this work, we go beyond this well-established framework and exploit the inherent commonalities among image restoration tasks. The primary objective is to identify components that are shareable across restoration tasks and augment the shared components with modules specifically trained for individual tasks. Towards this goal, we propose AdaIR, a novel framework that enables low storage cost and efficient training without sacrificing performance. Specifically, a generic restoration network is first constructed through self-supervised pre-training using synthetic degradations. Subsequent to the pre-training phase, adapters are trained to adapt the pre-trained network to specific degradations. AdaIR requires solely the training of lightweight, task-specific modules, ensuring a more efficient storage and training regimen. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of AdaIR and analyze the influence of the pre-training strategy on discovering shareable components. Extensive experimental results show that AdaIR achieves outstanding results on multi-task restoration while utilizing significantly fewer parameters (1.9 MB) and less training time (7 hours) for each restoration task. The source codes and trained models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSSR: Zero-shot Omnidirectional Image Super-Resolution using Stable Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10312v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional images (ODIs) are commonly used in real-world visual tasks, and high-resolution ODIs help improve the performance of related visual tasks. Most existing super-resolution methods for ODIs use end-to-end learning strategies, resulting in inferior realness of generated images and a lack of effective out-of-domain generalization capabilities in training methods. Image generation methods represented by diffusion model provide strong priors for visual tasks and have been proven to be effectively applied to image restoration tasks. Leveraging the image priors of the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, we achieve omnidirectional image super-resolution with both fidelity and realness, dubbed as OmniSSR. Firstly, we transform the equirectangular projection (ERP) images into tangent projection (TP) images, whose distribution approximates the planar image domain. Then, we use SD to iteratively sample initial high-resolution results. At each denoising iteration, we further correct and update the initial results using the proposed Octadecaplex Tangent Information Interaction (OTII) and Gradient Decomposition (GD) technique to ensure better consistency. Finally, the TP images are transformed back to obtain the final high-resolution results. Our method is zero-shot, requiring no training or fine-tuning. Experiments of our method on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this challenge, we present the IREANet, which improves the multiple exposure alignment and aggregation with a Flow-guide Feature Alignment Module (FFAM) and an Enhanced Feature Aggregation Module (EFAM). Specifically, the proposed FFAM incorporates the inter-frame optical flow as guidance to facilitate the deformable alignment and spatial attention modules for better feature alignment. The EFAM further employs the proposed Enhanced Residual Block (ERB) as a foundational component, wherein a unidirectional recurrent network aggregates the aligned temporal features to better reconstruct the results. To improve model generalization and performance, we additionally employ the Bayer preserving augmentation (BayerAug) strategy to augment the multi-exposure RAW inputs. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed IREANet shows state-of-the-art performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Referring Flexible Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10342v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reality, images often exhibit multiple degradations, such as rain and fog at night (triple degradations). However, in many cases, individuals may not want to remove all degradations, for instance, a blurry lens revealing a beautiful snowy landscape (double degradations). In such scenarios, people may only desire to deblur. These situations and requirements shed light on a new challenge in image restoration, where a model must perceive and remove specific degradation types specified by human commands in images with multiple degradations. We term this task Referring Flexible Image Restoration (RFIR). To address this, we first construct a large-scale synthetic dataset called RFIR, comprising 153,423 samples with the degraded image, text prompt for specific degradation removal and restored image. RFIR consists of five basic degradation types: blur, rain, haze, low light and snow while six main sub-categories are included for varying degrees of degradation removal. To tackle the challenge, we propose a novel transformer-based multi-task model named TransRFIR, which simultaneously perceives degradation types in the degraded image and removes specific degradation upon text prompt. TransRFIR is based on two devised attention modules, Multi-Head Agent Self-Attention (MHASA) and Multi-Head Agent Cross Attention (MHACA), where MHASA and MHACA introduce the agent token and reach the linear complexity, achieving lower computation cost than vanilla self-attention and cross-attention and obtaining competitive performances. Our TransRFIR achieves state-of-the-art performances compared with other counterparts and is proven as an effective architecture for image restoration. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/FIR-CP.</p></details> | 15 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Equipping Diffusion Models with Differentiable Spatial Entropy for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09735v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration, which aims to recover high-quality images from their corrupted counterparts, often faces the challenge of being an ill-posed problem that allows multiple solutions for a single input. However, most deep learning based works simply employ l1 loss to train their network in a deterministic way, resulting in over-smoothed predictions with inferior perceptual quality. In this work, we propose a novel method that shifts the focus from a deterministic pixel-by-pixel comparison to a statistical perspective, emphasizing the learning of distributions rather than individual pixel values. The core idea is to introduce spatial entropy into the loss function to measure the distribution difference between predictions and targets. To make this spatial entropy differentiable, we employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to approximate the probabilities for specific intensity values of each pixel with their neighbor areas. Specifically, we equip the entropy with diffusion models and aim for superior accuracy and enhanced perceptual quality over l1 based noise matching loss. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method for low light enhancement on two datasets and the NTIRE challenge 2024. All these results illustrate the effectiveness of our statistic-based entropy loss.

Typically, diffusion models trained in specific datasets fail to recover images that have out-of-distribution degradations. To address this problem, this work leverages a capable vision-language model and a synthetic degradation pipeline to learn image restoration in the wild (wild IR). More specifically, all low-quality images are simulated with a synthetic degradation pipeline that contains multiple common degradations such as blur, resize, noise, and JPEG compression. Then we introduce robust training for a degradation-aware CLIP model to extract enriched image content features to assist high-quality image restoration. Our base diffusion model is the image restoration SDE (IR-SDE). Built upon it, we further present a posterior sampling strategy for fast noise-free image generation. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real-world degradation datasets. Moreover, experiments on the unified image restoration task illustrate that the proposed posterior sampling improves image generation quality for various degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPRW...</summary><p>CVPRW 2024; Code: https://github.com/Algolzw/daclip-uir</p></details> |
| **[Image Restoration by Denoising Diffusion Models with Iteratively Preconditioned Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16519v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks has become a common approach for addressing image restoration problems. An alternative for training a "task-specific" network for each observation model is to use pretrained deep denoisers for imposing only the signal's prior within iterative algorithms, without additional training. Recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach has become popular with the rise of diffusion/score-based generative models. Using denoisers for general purpose restoration requires guiding the iterations to ensure agreement of the signal with the observations. In low-noise settings, guidance that is based on back-projection (BP) has been shown to be a promising strategy (used recently also under the names "pseudoinverse" or "range/null-space" guidance). However, the presence of noise in the observations hinders the gains from this approach. In this paper, we propose a novel guidance technique, based on preconditioning that allows traversing from BP-based guidance to least squares based guidance along the restoration scheme. The proposed approach is robust to noise while still having much simpler implementation than alternative methods (e.g., it does not require SVD or a large number of iterations). We use it within both an optimization scheme and a sampling-based scheme, and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods for image deblurring and super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (camera-ready).

| **[DiffBIR: Towards Blind Image Restoration with Generative Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15070v3)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present DiffBIR, a general restoration pipeline that could handle different blind image restoration tasks in a unified framework. DiffBIR decouples blind image restoration problem into two stages: 1) degradation removal: removing image-independent content; 2) information regeneration: generating the lost image content. Each stage is developed independently but they work seamlessly in a cascaded manner. In the first stage, we use restoration modules to remove degradations and obtain high-fidelity restored results. For the second stage, we propose IRControlNet that leverages the generative ability of latent diffusion models to generate realistic details. Specifically, IRControlNet is trained based on specially produced condition images without distracting noisy content for stable generation performance. Moreover, we design a region-adaptive restoration guidance that can modify the denoising process during inference without model re-training, allowing users to balance realness and fidelity through a tunable guidance scale. Extensive experiments have demonstrated DiffBIR's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches for blind image super-resolution, blind face restoration and blind image denoising tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

| **[TBSN: Transformer-Based Blind-Spot Network for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07846v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent network architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). Existing BSNs are mostly conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers offer potential solutions to the limitations of convolutions and have demonstrated success in various image restoration tasks, their attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thus restricting their applicability in SSID. In this paper, we present a transformer-based blind-spot network (TBSN) by analyzing and redesigning the transformer operators that meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, TBSN follows the architectural principles of dilated BSNs, and incorporates spatial as well as channel self-attention layers to enhance the network capability. For spatial self-attention, an elaborate mask is applied to the attention matrix to restrict its receptive field, thus mimicking the dilated convolution. For channel self-attention, we observe that it may leak the blind-spot information when the channel number is greater than spatial size in the deep layers of multi-scale architectures. To eliminate this effect, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-the-art SSID methods. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/nagejacob/TBSN.</p></details> |  |

Blind image decomposition was proposed to tackle this issue, however, its effectiveness heavily relies on the accurate estimation of each component. Although diffusion-based models exhibit strong generative abilities in image restoration tasks, they may generate irrelevant contents when the degraded images are severely corrupted. To address these issues, we leverage physical constraints to guide the whole restoration process, where a mixed degradation model based on atmosphere scattering model is constructed. Then we formulate our Joint Conditional Diffusion Model (JCDM) by incorporating the degraded image and degradation mask to provide precise guidance. To achieve better color and detail recovery results, we further integrate a refinement network to reconstruct the restored image, where Uncertainty Estimation Block (UEB) is employed to enhance the features. Extensive experiments performed on both multi-weather and weather-specific datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competing methods.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer models have demonstrated excellent performance in image restoration due to their self-attention mechanism, they face limitations in complex scenarios. Leveraging recent advancements in Transformers and various attention mechanisms, our method utilizes customized attention mechanisms to enhance overall performance. DART, our novel network architecture, employs windowed attention to mimic the selective focusing mechanism of human eyes. By dynamically adjusting receptive fields, it optimally captures the fundamental features crucial for image resolution reconstruction. Efficiency and performance balance are achieved through the LongIR attention mechanism for long sequence image restoration. Integration of attention mechanisms across feature and positional dimensions further enhances the recovery of fine details. Evaluation across five restoration tasks consistently positions DART at the forefront.

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

They utilize a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/disco-diff</p></details> |
| **[Improved Noise Schedule for Diffusion Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03297v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating visual signals. However, training a single model to predict noise across various levels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and incurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced to expedite convergence. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise ratio (logSNR), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample frequency around $\log \text{SNR}=0$. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits different prediction targets.</p></details> |  |

Unlike simpler music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces, the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments, voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory information reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEEM: Diffusion Models Serve as the Eyes of Large Language Models for Image Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15232v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have achieved tremendous success by promoting the synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation, they often face challenges when confronted with out-of-distribution data. This is primarily due to their reliance on image encoders trained to encode images into task-relevant features, which may lead them to disregard irrelevant details. Delving into the modeling capabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can diffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image perception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple and effective approach that utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous methods that solely relied on image encoders like ViT, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual hallucinations. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring additional training modules and with fewer training parameters. We extensively evaluated DEEM on both our newly constructed RobustVQA benchmark and another well-known benchmark, POPE, for object hallucination. Compared to the state-of-the-art interleaved content generation models, DEEM exhibits enhanced robustness and a superior capacity to alleviate model hallucinations while utilizing fewer trainable parameters, less pre-training data (10%), and a smaller base model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.10208 by other authors</p></details> |

However, most methods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when deployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an innovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm. This approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents through risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is grounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory generation. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further ensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL benchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to stringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to existing methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in advancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Concept Removal of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05873v5)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often inadvertently generate unwanted concepts such as watermarks and unsafe images. These concepts, termed as the "implicit concepts", could be unintentionally learned during training and then be generated uncontrollably during inference. Existing removal methods still struggle to eliminate implicit concepts primarily due to their dependency on the model's ability to recognize concepts it actually can not discern. To address this, we utilize the intrinsic geometric characteristics of implicit concepts and present the Geom-Erasing, a novel concept removal method based on the geometric-driven control. Specifically, once an unwanted implicit concept is identified, we integrate the existence and geometric information of the concept into the text prompts with the help of an accessible classifier or detector model. Subsequently, the model is optimized to identify and disentangle this information, which is then adopted as negative prompts during generation. Moreover, we introduce the Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD), a novel image-text dataset imbued with three typical implicit concepts (i.e., QR codes, watermarks, and text), reflecting real-life situations where implicit concepts are easily injected. Geom-Erasing effectively mitigates the generation of implicit concepts, achieving the state-of-the-art results on the Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P) and our challenging Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD) benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlerpFace: Face Template Protection via Spherical Linear Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03043v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary face recognition systems use feature templates extracted from face images to identify persons. To enhance privacy, face template protection techniques are widely employed to conceal sensitive identity and appearance information stored in the template. This paper identifies an emerging privacy attack form utilizing diffusion models that could nullify prior protection, referred to as inversion attacks. The attack can synthesize high-quality, identity-preserving face images from templates, revealing persons' appearance. Based on studies of the diffusion model's generative capability, this paper proposes a defense to deteriorate the attack, by rotating templates to a noise-like distribution. This is achieved efficiently by spherically and linearly interpolating templates, or slerp, on their located hypersphere. This paper further proposes to group-wisely divide and drop out templates' feature dimensions, to enhance the irreversibility of rotated templates. The division of groups and dropouts within each group are learned in a recognition-favored way. The proposed techniques are concretized as a novel face template protection technique, SlerpFace. Extensive experiments show that SlerpFace provides satisfactory recognition accuracy and comprehensive privacy protection against inversion and other attack forms, superior to prior arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>face ...</summary><p>face template protection</p></details> |

This paper proposes frequency-controlled diffusion model (FCDiffusion), an end-to-end diffusion-based framework that contributes a novel solution to text-guided I2I from a frequency-domain perspective. At the heart of our framework is a feature-space frequency-domain filtering module based on Discrete Cosine Transform, which filters the latent features of the source image in the DCT domain, yielding filtered image features bearing different DCT spectral bands as different control signals to the pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model. We reveal that control signals of different DCT spectral bands bridge the source image and the T2I generated image in different correlations (e.g., style, structure, layout, contour, etc.), and thus enable versatile I2I applications emphasizing different I2I correlations, including style-guided content creation, image semantic manipulation, image scene translation, and image style translation. Different from related approaches, FCDiffusion establishes a unified text-guided I2I framework suitable for diverse image translation tasks simply by switching among different frequency control branches at inference time. The effectiveness and superiority of our method for text-guided I2I are demonstrated with extensive experiments both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/XiangGao1102/FCDiffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |

Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on EVS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the EVS problem in urban scene reconstruction.

| **[Single Image Rolling Shutter Removal with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02906v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RS-Diffusion, the first Diffusion Models-based method for single-frame Rolling Shutter (RS) correction. RS artifacts compromise visual quality of frames due to the row wise exposure of CMOS sensors. Most previous methods have focused on multi-frame approaches, using temporal information from consecutive frames for the motion rectification. However, few approaches address the more challenging but important single frame RS correction. In this work, we present an ``image-to-motion'' framework via diffusion techniques, with a designed patch-attention module. In addition, we present the RS-Real dataset, comprised of captured RS frames alongside their corresponding Global Shutter (GS) ground-truth pairs. The GS frames are corrected from the RS ones, guided by the corresponding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) gyroscope data acquired during capture. Experiments show that our RS-Diffusion surpasses previous single RS correction methods. Our method and proposed RS-Real dataset lay a solid foundation for advancing the field of RS correction.</p></details> |  |

However, generating videos that precisely retain the shape and location of moving objects such as robots remains a challenge. This paper presents diffusion models specifically tailored to generate videos that accurately maintain the shape and location of mobile robots. This development offers substantial benefits to those working on detecting dangerous interactions between humans and robots by facilitating the creation of training data for collision detection models, circumventing the need for collecting data from the real world, which often involves legal and ethical issues. Our models incorporate techniques such as embedding accessible robot pose information and applying semantic mask regulation within the ConvNext backbone network. These techniques are designed to refine intermediate outputs, therefore improving the retention performance of shape and location. Through extensive experimentation, our models have demonstrated notable improvements in maintaining the shape and location of different robots, as well as enhancing overall video generation quality, compared to the benchmark diffusion model.

The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, as the alignment occurs in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory and propose to augment the DNO loss with certain probability regularization. We conduct extensive experiments on several popular reward functions trained on human feedback data and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach achieves state-of-the-art reward scores as well as high image quality, all within a reasonable time budget for generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ColorizeDiffusion: Adjustable Sketch Colorization with Reference Image and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01456v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently demonstrated their effectiveness in generating extremely high-quality images and are now utilized in a wide range of applications, including automatic sketch colorization. Although many methods have been developed for guided sketch colorization, there has been limited exploration of the potential conflicts between image prompts and sketch inputs, which can lead to severe deterioration in the results. Therefore, this paper exhaustively investigates reference-based sketch colorization models that aim to colorize sketch images using reference color images. We specifically investigate two critical aspects of reference-based diffusion models: the "distribution problem", which is a major shortcoming compared to text-based counterparts, and the capability in zero-shot sequential text-based manipulation. We introduce two variations of an image-guided latent diffusion model utilizing different image tokens from the pre-trained CLIP image encoder and propose corresponding manipulation methods to adjust their results sequentially using weighted text inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our models through qualitative and quantitative experiments as well as a user study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Accelerated MRI via Implicit Neural Representation Guided Posterior Sampling of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02744v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing high-fidelity magnetic resonance (MR) images from under-sampled k-space is a commonly used strategy to reduce scan time. The posterior sampling of diffusion models based on the real measurement data holds significant promise of improved reconstruction accuracy. However, traditional posterior sampling methods often lack effective data consistency guidance, leading to inaccurate and unstable reconstructions. Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems by modeling a signal's attributes as a continuous function of spatial coordinates. In this study, we present a novel posterior sampler for diffusion models using INR, named DiffINR. The INR-based component incorporates both the diffusion prior distribution and the MRI physical model to ensure high data fidelity. DiffINR demonstrates superior performance on experimental datasets with remarkable accuracy, even under high acceleration factors (up to R=12 in single-channel reconstruction). Notably, our proposed framework can be a generalizable framework to solve inverse problems in other medical imaging tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Training, No Problem: Rethinking Classifier-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02687v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Organic or Diffused: Can We Distinguish Human Art from AI-generated Images?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03214v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of generative AI images has completely disrupted the art world. Distinguishing AI generated images from human art is a challenging problem whose impact is growing over time. A failure to address this problem allows bad actors to defraud individuals paying a premium for human art and companies whose stated policies forbid AI imagery. It is also critical for content owners to establish copyright, and for model trainers interested in curating training data in order to avoid potential model collapse. There are several different approaches to distinguishing human art from AI images, including classifiers trained by supervised learning, research tools targeting diffusion models, and identification by professional artists using their knowledge of artistic techniques. In this paper, we seek to understand how well these approaches can perform against today's modern generative models in both benign and adversarial settings. We curate real human art across 7 styles, generate matching images from 5 generative models, and apply 8 detectors (5 automated detectors and 3 different human groups including 180 crowdworkers, 4000+ professional artists, and 13 expert artists experienced at detecting AI). Both Hive and expert artists do very well, but make mistakes in different ways (Hive is weaker against adversarial perturbations while Expert artists produce higher false positives). We believe these weaknesses will remain as models continue to evolve, and use our data to demonstrate why a combined team of human and automated detectors provides the best combination of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

This work formalizes the problem of style-aware drag-and-drop and presents a method for tackling it by addressing two sub-problems: style-aware personalization and realistic object insertion in stylized images. For style-aware personalization, our method first fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model using LoRA and learned text tokens on the subject image, and then infuses it with a CLIP representation of the target style. For object insertion, we use Bootstrapped Domain Adaption to adapt a domain-specific photorealistic object insertion model to the domain of diverse artistic styles. Overall, the method significantly outperforms traditional approaches such as inpainting. Finally, we present a dataset, SubjectPlop, to facilitate evaluation and future progress in this area.

| **[Boosting Consistency in Story Visualization with Rich-Contextual Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02482v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research showcases the considerable potential of conditional diffusion models for generating consistent stories. However, current methods, which predominantly generate stories in an autoregressive and excessively caption-dependent manner, often underrate the contextual consistency and relevance of frames during sequential generation. To address this, we propose a novel Rich-contextual Conditional Diffusion Models (RCDMs), a two-stage approach designed to enhance story generation's semantic consistency and temporal consistency. Specifically, in the first stage, the frame-prior transformer diffusion model is presented to predict the frame semantic embedding of the unknown clip by aligning the semantic correlations between the captions and frames of the known clip. The second stage establishes a robust model with rich contextual conditions, including reference images of the known clip, the predicted frame semantic embedding of the unknown clip, and text embeddings of all captions. By jointly injecting these rich contextual conditions at the image and feature levels, RCDMs can generate semantic and temporal consistency stories. Moreover, RCDMs can generate consistent stories with a single forward inference compared to autoregressive models. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our proposed RCDMs outperform in challenging scenarios. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/muzishen/RCDMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructLDM: Structured Latent Diffusion for 3D Human Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01241v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D human generative models have achieved remarkable progress by learning 3D-aware GANs from 2D images. However, existing 3D human generative methods model humans in a compact 1D latent space, ignoring the articulated structure and semantics of human body topology. In this paper, we explore more expressive and higher-dimensional latent space for 3D human modeling and propose StructLDM, a diffusion-based unconditional 3D human generative model, which is learned from 2D images. StructLDM solves the challenges imposed due to the high-dimensional growth of latent space with three key designs: 1) A semantic structured latent space defined on the dense surface manifold of a statistical human body template. 2) A structured 3D-aware auto-decoder that factorizes the global latent space into several semantic body parts parameterized by a set of conditional structured local NeRFs anchored to the body template, which embeds the properties learned from the 2D training data and can be decoded to render view-consistent humans under different poses and clothing styles. 3) A structured latent diffusion model for generative human appearance sampling. Extensive experiments validate StructLDM's state-of-the-art generation performance and illustrate the expressiveness of the structured latent space over the well-adopted 1D latent space. Notably, StructLDM enables different levels of controllable 3D human generation and editing, including pose/view/shape control, and high-level tasks including compositional generations, part-aware clothing editing, 3D virtual try-on, etc. Our project page is at: https://taohuumd.github.io/projects/StructLDM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01392v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where a diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

With recent advances in controllable text-to-image diffusion models, more concise research is now focusing on rendering text within synthetic images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of end-to-end poster generation remains underexplored. This complex task involves striking a balance between text rendering accuracy and automated layout to produce high-resolution images with variable aspect ratios. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end text rendering framework employing a triple cross-attention mechanism rooted in align learning, designed to create precise poster text within detailed contextual backgrounds. Additionally, we introduce a high-resolution dataset that exceeds 1024 pixels in image resolution. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate the ability of our method to generate poster images featuring intricate and contextually rich backgrounds.

| **[LaMoD: Latent Motion Diffusion Model For Myocardial Strain Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02229v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion and deformation analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging videos is crucial for assessing myocardial strain of patients with abnormal heart functions. Recent advances in deep learning-based image registration algorithms have shown promising results in predicting motion fields from routinely acquired CMR sequences. However, their accuracy often diminishes in regions with subtle appearance change, with errors propagating over time. Advanced imaging techniques, such as displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) CMR, offer highly accurate and reproducible motion data but require additional image acquisition, which poses challenges in busy clinical flows. In this paper, we introduce a novel Latent Motion Diffusion model (LaMoD) to predict highly accurate DENSE motions from standard CMR videos. More specifically, our method first employs an encoder from a pre-trained registration network that learns latent motion features (also considered as deformation-based shape features) from image sequences. Supervised by the ground-truth motion provided by DENSE, LaMoD then leverages a probabilistic latent diffusion model to reconstruct accurate motion from these extracted features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, LaMoD, significantly improves the accuracy of motion analysis in standard CMR images; hence improving myocardial strain analysis in clinical settings for cardiac patients. Our code will be publicly available on upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

We present UltraPixel, a novel architecture utilizing cascade diffusion models to generate high-quality images at multiple resolutions (\textit{e.g.}, 1K to 6K) within a single model, while maintaining computational efficiency. UltraPixel leverages semantics-rich representations of lower-resolution images in the later denoising stage to guide the whole generation of highly detailed high-resolution images, significantly reducing complexity. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural representations for continuous upsampling and scale-aware normalization layers adaptable to various resolutions. Notably, both low- and high-resolution processes are performed in the most compact space, sharing the majority of parameters with less than 3$\%$ additional parameters for high-resolution outputs, largely enhancing training and inference efficiency. Our model achieves fast training with reduced data requirements, producing photo-realistic high-resolution images and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, when detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53% on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems(TCSS).

Since trained with normal data only, diffusion models tend to reconstruct normal counterparts of test images with certain noises added. However, these methods treat all potential anomalies equally, which may cause two main problems. From the global perspective, the difficulty of reconstructing images with different anomalies is uneven. Therefore, instead of utilizing the same setting for all samples, we propose to predict a particular denoising step for each sample by evaluating the difference between image contents and the priors extracted from diffusion models. From the local perspective, reconstructing abnormal regions differs from normal areas even in the same image. Theoretically, the diffusion model predicts a noise for each step, typically following a standard Gaussian distribution. However, due to the difference between the anomaly and its potential normal counterpart, the predicted noise in abnormal regions will inevitably deviate from the standard Gaussian distribution. To this end, we propose introducing synthetic abnormal samples in training to encourage the diffusion models to break through the limitation of standard Gaussian distribution, and a spatial-adaptive feature fusion scheme is utilized during inference. With the above modifications, we propose a global and local adaptive diffusion model (abbreviated to GLAD) for unsupervised anomaly detection, which introduces appealing flexibility and achieves anomaly-free reconstruction while retaining as much normal information as possible. Extensive experiments are conducted on three commonly used anomaly detection datasets (MVTec-AD, MPDD, and VisA) and a printed circuit board dataset (PCB-Bank) we integrated, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024, code and models: https://github.com/hyao1/GLAD.

| **[DiffStyler: Diffusion-based Localized Image Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18461v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image style transfer aims to imbue digital imagery with the distinctive attributes of style targets, such as colors, brushstrokes, shapes, whilst concurrently preserving the semantic integrity of the content. Despite the advancements in arbitrary style transfer methods, a prevalent challenge remains the delicate equilibrium between content semantics and style attributes. Recent developments in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heralded unprecedented synthesis capabilities, albeit at the expense of relying on extensive and often imprecise textual descriptions to delineate artistic styles. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces DiffStyler, a novel approach that facilitates efficient and precise arbitrary image style transfer. DiffStyler lies the utilization of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model-based LoRA to encapsulate the essence of style targets. This approach, coupled with strategic cross-LoRA feature and attention injection, guides the style transfer process. The foundation of our methodology is rooted in the observation that LoRA maintains the spatial feature consistency of UNet, a discovery that further inspired the development of a mask-wise style transfer technique. This technique employs masks extracted through a pre-trained FastSAM model, utilizing mask prompts to facilitate feature fusion during the denoising process, thereby enabling localized style transfer that preserves the original image's unaffected regions. Moreover, our approach accommodates multiple style targets through the use of corresponding masks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that DiffStyler surpasses previous methods in achieving a more harmonious balance between content preservation and style integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/lishaoxu1994/DiffStyler</p></details> |

Current TTSong methods, inherited from singing voice synthesis (SVS), require melody-related information that can sometimes be impractical, such as music scores or MIDI sequences. We present MelodyLM, the first TTSong model that generates high-quality song pieces with fully text-controlled melodies, achieving minimal user requirements and maximum control flexibility. MelodyLM explicitly models MIDI as the intermediate melody-related feature and sequentially generates vocal tracks in a language model manner, conditioned on textual and vocal prompts. The accompaniment music is subsequently synthesized by a latent diffusion model with hybrid conditioning for temporal alignment. With minimal requirements, users only need to input lyrics and a reference voice to synthesize a song sample. For full control, just input textual prompts or even directly input MIDI. Experimental results indicate that MelodyLM achieves superior performance in terms of both objective and subjective metrics.

Instead of spending hours of online optimization per text prompt, recent studies have been focused on learning a text-to-3D generative network for amortizing multiple text-3D relations, which can synthesize 3D contents in seconds. However, existing score distillation methods are hard to scale up to a large amount of text prompts due to the difficulties in aligning pretrained diffusion prior with the distribution of rendered images from various text prompts. Current state-of-the-arts such as Variational Score Distillation finetune the pretrained diffusion model to minimize the noise prediction error so as to align the distributions, which are however unstable to train and will impair the model's comprehension capability to numerous text prompts. Based on the observation that the diffusion models tend to have lower noise prediction errors at earlier timesteps, we propose Asynchronous Score Distillation (ASD), which minimizes the noise prediction error by shifting the diffusion timestep to earlier ones. ASD is stable to train and can scale up to 100k prompts. It reduces the noise prediction error without changing the weights of pre-trained diffusion model, thus keeping its strong comprehension capability to prompts. We conduct extensive experiments across different 2D diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion and MVDream, and text-to-3D generators, including Hyper-iNGP, 3DConv-Net and Triplane-Transformer. The results demonstrate ASD's effectiveness in stable 3D generator training, high-quality 3D content synthesis, and its superior prompt-consistency, especially under large prompt corpus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024.

We first comprehensively analyze inference request traces for commercial text-to-image applications. It commences with our observation that add-on modules, i.e., ControlNets and LoRAs, that augment the base stable diffusion models, are ubiquitous in generating images for commercial applications. Despite their efficacy, these add-on modules incur high loading overhead, prolong the serving latency, and swallow up expensive GPU resources. Driven by our characterization study, we present SwiftDiffusion, a system that efficiently generates high-quality images using stable diffusion models and add-on modules. To achieve this, SwiftDiffusion reconstructs the existing text-to-image serving workflow by identifying the opportunities for parallel computation and distributing ControlNet computations across multiple GPUs. Further, SwiftDiffusion thoroughly analyzes the dynamics of image generation and develops techniques to eliminate the overhead associated with LoRA loading and patching while preserving the image quality. Last, SwiftDiffusion proposes specialized optimizations in the backbone architecture of the stable diffusion models, which are also compatible with the efficient serving of add-on modules. Compared to state-of-the-art text-to-image serving systems, SwiftDiffusion reduces serving latency by up to 5x and improves serving throughput by up to 2x without compromising image quality.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The intricate nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by dynamic obstacles and maze-like structures, underscores the complexity of robot local navigation decision-making as a conditional distribution problem. Nevertheless, leveraging the diffusion model for robot local navigation is not trivial and encounters several under-explored challenges: (1) Data Urgency. The complex conditional distribution in local navigation needs training data to include diverse policy in diverse real-world scenarios; (2) Myopic Observation. Due to the diversity of the perception scenarios, diffusion decisions based on the local perspective of robots may prove suboptimal for completing the entire task, as they often lack foresight. In certain scenarios requiring detours, the robot may become trapped. To address these issues, our approach begins with an exploration of a diverse data generation mechanism that encompasses multiple agents exhibiting distinct preferences through target selection informed by integrated global-local insights. Then, based on this diverse training data, a diffusion agent is obtained, capable of excellent collision avoidance in diverse scenarios. Subsequently, we augment our Local Diffusion Planner, also known as LDP by incorporating global observations in a lightweight manner. This enhancement broadens the observational scope of LDP, effectively mitigating the risk of becoming ensnared in local optima and promoting more robust navigational decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Grounded text-to-Video generation framework, termed GVDIFF. First, we inject the grounding condition into the self-attention through an uncertainty-based representation to explicitly guide the focus of the network. Second, we introduce a spatial-temporal grounding layer that connects the grounding condition with target objects and enables the model with the grounded generation capacity in the spatial-temporal domain. Third, our dynamic gate network adaptively skips the redundant grounding process to selectively extract grounding information and semantics while improving efficiency. We extensively evaluate the grounded generation capacity of GVDIFF and demonstrate its versatility in applications, including long-range video generation, sequential prompts, and object-specific editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Class Anomaly Detection via Diffusion Refinement with Dual Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01905v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection, the technique of identifying abnormal samples using only normal samples, has attracted widespread interest in industry. Existing one-model-per-category methods often struggle with limited generalization capabilities due to their focus on a single category, and can fail when encountering variations in product. Recent feature reconstruction methods, as representatives in one-model-all-categories schemes, face challenges including reconstructing anomalous samples and blurry reconstructions. In this paper, we creatively combine a diffusion model and a transformer for multi-class anomaly detection. This approach leverages diffusion to obtain high-frequency information for refinement, greatly alleviating the blurry reconstruction problem while maintaining the sampling efficiency of the reverse diffusion process. The task is transformed into image inpainting to disconnect the input-output correlation, thereby mitigating the "identical shortcuts" problem and avoiding the model from reconstructing anomalous samples. Besides, we introduce category-awareness using dual conditioning to ensure the accuracy of prediction and reconstruction in the reverse diffusion process, preventing excessive deviation from the target category, thus effectively enabling multi-class anomaly detection. Futhermore, Spatio-temporal fusion is also employed to fuse heatmaps predicted at different timesteps and scales, enhancing the performance of multi-class anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance and exceptional multi-class anomaly detection capabilities of our proposed method compared to others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01903v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations. However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning. We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data. In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the room layout, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room. To address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Moreover, Ctrl-Room enables versatile interactive editing operations such as resizing or moving individual furniture items. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance. Our proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout and text prompt. We thus achieve a high-quality 3D room generation with convincing layouts and lively textures. Benefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from natural language prompts.</p></details> |  |

Currently, two primary paradigms dominate the field of text-to-3D: the feed-forward generation solutions, capable of swiftly producing 3D assets but often yielding coarse results, and the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) based solutions, known for generating high-fidelity 3D assets albeit at a slower pace. The synergistic integration of these methods holds substantial promise for advancing 3D generation techniques. In this paper, we present BoostDream, a highly efficient plug-and-play 3D refining method designed to transform coarse 3D assets into high-quality. The BoostDream framework comprises three distinct processes: (1) We introduce 3D model distillation that fits differentiable representations from the 3D assets obtained through feed-forward generation. (2) A novel multi-view SDS loss is designed, which utilizes a multi-view aware 2D diffusion model to refine the 3D assets. (3) We propose to use prompt and multi-view consistent normal maps as guidance in refinement.Our extensive experiment is conducted on different differentiable 3D representations, revealing that BoostDream excels in generating high-quality 3D assets rapidly, overcoming the Janus problem compared to conventional SDS-based methods. This breakthrough signifies a substantial advancement in both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01812v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown diffusion models are an effective approach to learning the multimodal distributions arising from demonstration data in behavior cloning. However, a drawback of this approach is the need to learn a denoising function, which is significantly more complex than learning an explicit policy. In this work, we propose Equivariant Diffusion Policy, a novel diffusion policy learning method that leverages domain symmetries to obtain better sample efficiency and generalization in the denoising function. We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant. We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9% higher than the baseline Diffusion Policy. We also evaluate the method on a real-world system to show that effective policies can be learned with relatively few training samples, whereas the baseline Diffusion Policy cannot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label-free Neural Semantic Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01790v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown great progress in integrating spatial conditioning to control large, pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Despite these advances, existing methods describe the spatial image content using hand-crafted conditioning inputs, which are either semantically ambiguous (e.g., edges) or require expensive manual annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation). To address these limitations, we propose a new label-free way of conditioning diffusion models to enable fine-grained spatial control. We introduce the concept of neural semantic image synthesis, which uses neural layouts extracted from pre-trained foundation models as conditioning. Neural layouts are advantageous as they provide rich descriptions of the desired image, containing both semantics and detailed geometry of the scene. We experimentally show that images synthesized via neural semantic image synthesis achieve similar or superior pixel-level alignment of semantic classes compared to those created using expensive semantic label maps. At the same time, they capture better semantics, instance separation, and object orientation than other label-free conditioning options, such as edges or depth. Moreover, we show that images generated by neural layout conditioning can effectively augment real data for training various perception tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

We propose EquiBot, a robust, data-efficient, and generalizable approach for robot manipulation task learning. Our approach combines SIM(3)-equivariant neural network architectures with diffusion models. This ensures that our learned policies are invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and translation, enhancing their applicability to unseen environments while retaining the benefits of diffusion-based policy learning such as multi-modality and robustness. We show in a suite of 6 simulation tasks that our proposed method reduces the data requirements and improves generalization to novel scenarios. In the real world, we show with in total 10 variations of 6 mobile manipulation tasks that our method can easily generalize to novel objects and scenes after learning from just 5 minutes of human demonstrations in each task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, the increased size of these models leads to higher inference costs, making them less attractive for real-time applications. We present Fast-FORward CAching (FORA), a simple yet effective approach designed to accelerate DiT by exploiting the repetitive nature of the diffusion process. FORA implements a caching mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate outputs from the attention and MLP layers across denoising steps, thereby reducing computational overhead. This approach does not require model retraining and seamlessly integrates with existing transformer-based diffusion models. Experiments show that FORA can speed up diffusion transformers several times over while only minimally affecting performance metrics such as the IS Score and FID. By enabling faster processing with minimal trade-offs in quality, FORA represents a significant advancement in deploying diffusion transformers for real-time applications. Code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/prathebaselva/FORA.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose DreamPBR, a novel diffusion-based generative framework designed to create spatially-varying appearance properties guided by text and multi-modal controls, providing high controllability and diversity in material generation. Key to achieving diverse and high-quality PBR material generation lies in integrating the capabilities of recent large-scale vision-language models trained on billions of text-image pairs, along with material priors derived from hundreds of PBR material samples. We utilize a novel material Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to establish the mapping between albedo maps and the corresponding latent space. The latent representation is then decoded into full SVBRDF parameter maps using a rendering-aware PBR decoder. Our method supports tileable generation through convolution with circular padding. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal guidance module, which includes pixel-aligned guidance, style image guidance, and 3D shape guidance, to enhance the control capabilities of the material LDM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DreamPBR in material creation, showcasing its versatility and user-friendliness on a wide range of controllable generation and editing applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |

However, GAN-based training often faces issues such as mode collapse and unstable optimization. Furthermore, due to the complex mapping between shadow and shadow-free domains, merely relying on adversarial learning is not enough to capture the underlying relationship between two domains, resulting in low quality of the generated images. To address these problems, we propose a semantic-guided adversarial diffusion framework for self-supervised shadow removal, which consists of two stages. At first stage a semantic-guided generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) is proposed to carry out a coarse result and construct paired synthetic data through a cycle-consistent structure. Then the coarse result is refined with a diffusion-based restoration module (DBRM) to enhance the texture details and edge artifact at second stage. Meanwhile, we propose a multi-modal semantic prompter (MSP) that aids in extracting accurate semantic information from real images and text, guiding the shadow removal network to restore images better in SG-GAN. We conduct experiments on multiple public datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on large, clean datasets for training limits their practical use where clean data is scarce. In this paper, we propose EMDiffusion, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach to train diffusion models from corrupted observations. Our method alternates between reconstructing clean images from corrupted data using a known diffusion model (E-step) and refining diffusion model weights based on these reconstructions (M-step). This iterative process leads the learned diffusion model to gradually converge to the true clean data distribution. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse computational imaging tasks, including random inpainting, denoising, and deblurring, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, target-aware generative models, especially diffusion models, have shown great promise in modeling protein-ligand interactions and generating candidate drugs. However, existing models primarily focus on learning the chemical distribution of all drug candidates, which lacks effective steerability on the chemical quality of model generations. In this paper, we propose a novel and general alignment framework to align pretrained target diffusion models with preferred functional properties, named AliDiff. AliDiff shifts the target-conditioned chemical distribution towards regions with higher binding affinity and structural rationality, specified by user-defined reward functions, via the preference optimization approach. To avoid the overfitting problem in common preference optimization objectives, we further develop an improved Exact Energy Preference Optimization method to yield an exact and efficient alignment of the diffusion models, and provide the closed-form expression for the converged distribution. Empirical studies on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that AliDiff can generate molecules with state-of-the-art binding energies with up to -7.07 Avg. Vina Score, while maintaining strong molecular properties.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of generative artificial intelligence has positioned Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as crucial tools for managing healthcare data. MLLMs can support multi-modal inputs and generate diverse types of content by leveraging large-scale training on vast amounts of multi-modal data. However, critical challenges persist in developing medical MLLMs, including healthcare data security and freshness issues, affecting the output quality of MLLMs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-empowered medical MLLMs framework for healthcare data management. This framework leverages a hierarchical cross-chain architecture to facilitate secure data training. Moreover, it enhances the output quality of MLLMs through hybrid RAG, which employs multi-modal metrics to filter various unimodal RAG results and incorporates these retrieval results as additional inputs to MLLMs. Additionally, we employ age of information to indirectly evaluate the data freshness impact of MLLMs and utilize contract theory to incentivize healthcare data holders to share fresh data, mitigating information asymmetry in data sharing. Finally, we utilize a generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the optimal contract for efficient data sharing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, which achieve secure and efficient healthcare data management.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, while reducing radiation exposure through low-dose PET scans is beneficial for patient safety, it often results in insufficient statistical data. This scarcity of data poses significant challenges for accurately reconstructing high-quality images, which are essential for reliable diagnostic outcomes. In this research, we propose a diffusion transformer model (DTM) guided by joint compact prior (JCP) to enhance the reconstruction quality of low-dose PET imaging. In light of current research findings, we present a pioneering PET reconstruction model that integrates diffusion and transformer models for joint optimization. This model combines the powerful distribution mapping abilities of diffusion models with the capacity of transformers to capture long-range dependencies, offering significant advantages for low-dose PET reconstruction. Additionally, the incorporation of the lesion refining block and penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) enhance the recovery capability of lesion regions and preserves detail information, solving blurring problems in lesion areas and texture details of most deep learning frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DTM in enhancing image quality and preserving critical clinical information for low-dose PET scans. Our approach not only reduces radiation exposure risks but also provides a more reliable PET imaging tool for early disease detection and patient management.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking the Robustness of Models Trained with Synthetic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20469v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing challenge in developing machine learning approaches has been the lack of high-quality labeled data. Recently, models trained with purely synthetic data, here termed synthetic clones, generated using large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have shown promising results in overcoming this annotation bottleneck. As these synthetic clone models progress, they are likely to be deployed in challenging real-world settings, yet their suitability remains understudied. Our work addresses this gap by providing the first benchmark for three classes of synthetic clone models, namely supervised, self-supervised, and multi-modal ones, across a range of robustness measures. We show that existing synthetic self-supervised and multi-modal clones are comparable to or outperform state-of-the-art real-image baselines for a range of robustness metrics - shape bias, background bias, calibration, etc. However, we also find that synthetic clones are much more susceptible to adversarial and real-world noise than models trained with real data. To address this, we find that combining both real and synthetic data further increases the robustness, and that the choice of prompt used for generating synthetic images plays an important part in the robustness of synthetic clones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024 Workshop: SyntaGen-Harnessing Generative Models for Synthetic Visual Datasets.

However, this approach is still confronted with critical geometric inconsistency problems such as the Janus problem. Starting from a hypothesis that such inconsistency problems may be induced by multiview inconsistencies between 2D scores predicted from various viewpoints, we introduce GSD, a simple and general plug-and-play framework for incorporating 3D consistency and therefore geometry awareness into the SDS process. Our methodology is composed of three components: 3D consistent noising, designed to produce 3D consistent noise maps that perfectly follow the standard Gaussian distribution, geometry-based gradient warping for identifying correspondences between predicted gradients of different viewpoints, and novel gradient consistency loss to optimize the scene geometry toward producing more consistent gradients. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance, successfully addressing the geometric inconsistency problems in text-to-3D generation task with minimal computation cost and being compatible with existing score distillation-based models.

For a class of power nonlinear sub-diffusion models with variable coefficients, we prove that their solutions have Mittag-Leffler stability when the source functions satisfy natural decay assumptions. That is the solutions have the decay rate $\|u(t)\|_{L^{s}(\Omega)}=O\left( t^{-(\alpha+\beta)/\gamma} \right)$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$, where $\alpha$, $\gamma$ are positive constants, $\beta\in(-\alpha,\infty)$ and $s\in (1,\infty)$. Then we develop the structure preserving algorithm for this type of model. For the complete monotonicity-preserving ($\mathcal{CM}$-preserving) schemes developed by Li and Wang (Commun. Math. Sci., 19(5):1301-1336, 2021), we prove that they satisfy the discrete comparison principle for time fractional differential equations with variable coefficients. Then, by carefully constructing the fine the discrete supsolution and subsolution, we obtain the long time optimal decay rate of the numerical solution $\|u_{n}\|_{L^{s}(\Omega)}=O\left( t_n^{-(\alpha+\beta)/\gamma} \right)$ as $t_{n}\rightarrow\infty$, which is fully agree with the theoretical solution. Finally, we validated the analysis results through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstantStyle-Plus: Style Transfer with Content-Preserving in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00788v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Style transfer is an inventive process designed to create an image that maintains the essence of the original while embracing the visual style of another. Although diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generative power in personalized subject-driven or style-driven applications, existing state-of-the-art methods still encounter difficulties in achieving a seamless balance between content preservation and style enhancement. For example, amplifying the style's influence can often undermine the structural integrity of the content. To address these challenges, we deconstruct the style transfer task into three core elements: 1) Style, focusing on the image's aesthetic characteristics; 2) Spatial Structure, concerning the geometric arrangement and composition of visual elements; and 3) Semantic Content, which captures the conceptual meaning of the image. Guided by these principles, we introduce InstantStyle-Plus, an approach that prioritizes the integrity of the original content while seamlessly integrating the target style. Specifically, our method accomplishes style injection through an efficient, lightweight process, utilizing the cutting-edge InstantStyle framework. To reinforce the content preservation, we initiate the process with an inverted content latent noise and a versatile plug-and-play tile ControlNet for preserving the original image's intrinsic layout. We also incorporate a global semantic adapter to enhance the semantic content's fidelity. To safeguard against the dilution of style information, a style extractor is employed as discriminator for providing supplementary style guidance.

Several attempts have been made to adapt Stable Diffusion (SD) to the medical domain. However, the large distribution difference between medical reports and natural texts, as well as high computational complexity in common stable diffusion limit the authenticity and feasibility of the generated medical images. To solve above problems, we propose a novel light-weight transformer-based diffusion model learning framework, Chest-Diffusion, for report-to-CXR generation. Chest-Diffusion employs a domain-specific text encoder to obtain accurate and expressive text features to guide image generation, improving the authenticity of the generated images. Meanwhile, we introduce a light-weight transformer architecture as the denoising model, reducing the computational complexity of the diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate that our Chest-Diffusion achieves the lowest FID score 24.456, under the computation budget of 118.918 GFLOPs, which is nearly one-third of the computational complexity of SD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior Sampling with Denoising Oracles via Tilted Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00745v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced high-dimensional data generation across various domains, by learning a denoising oracle (or score) from datasets. From a Bayesian perspective, they offer a realistic modeling of data priors and facilitate solving inverse problems through posterior sampling. Although many heuristic methods have been developed recently for this purpose, they lack the quantitative guarantees needed in many scientific applications. In this work, we introduce the \textit{tilted transport} technique, which leverages the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems in combination with the prior denoising oracle to transform the original posterior sampling problem into a new `boosted' posterior that is provably easier to sample from. We quantify the conditions under which this boosted posterior is strongly log-concave, highlighting the dependencies on the condition number of the measurement matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting posterior sampling scheme is shown to reach the computational threshold predicted for sampling Ising models [Kunisky'23] with a direct analysis, and is further validated on high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and scalar field $\varphi^4$ models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4GEN: Leveraging Semantic Representation of LLMs for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00737v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have exhibited substantial success in text-to-image generation. However, they often encounter challenges when dealing with complex and dense prompts that involve multiple objects, attribute binding, and long descriptions. This paper proposes a framework called \textbf{LLM4GEN}, which enhances the semantic understanding ability of text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging the semantic representation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Through a specially designed Cross-Adapter Module (CAM) that combines the original text features of text-to-image models with LLM features, LLM4GEN can be easily incorporated into various diffusion models as a plug-and-play component and enhances text-to-image generation. Additionally, to facilitate the complex and dense prompts semantic understanding, we develop a LAION-refined dataset, consisting of 1 million (M) text-image pairs with improved image descriptions. We also introduce DensePrompts which contains 7,000 dense prompts to provide a comprehensive evaluation for the text-to-image generation task. With just 10\% of the training data required by recent ELLA, LLM4GEN significantly improves the semantic alignment of SD1.5 and SDXL, demonstrating increases of 7.69\% and 9.60\% in color on T2I-CompBench, respectively. The extensive experiments on DensePrompts also demonstrate that LLM4GEN surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in terms of sample quality, image-text alignment, and human evaluation.

The model is based on a learnable Markov transition kernel to recover the data distribution from the Gaussian distribution. The Markov process is conditioned on the obstacle geometry, estimating the noise to be removed at each step, implemented via a U-Net. A cross-attention mechanism incorporates the geometry as a prompt. We train the geometry-to-flow diffusion model using a dataset of flows past simple obstacles, including the circle, ellipse, rectangle, and triangle. For comparison, the CNN model is trained using the same dataset. Tests are carried out on flows past obstacles with simple and complex geometries, representing interpolation and extrapolation on the geometry condition, respectively. In the test set, challenging scenarios include a cross and characters `PKU'. Generated flow fields show that the geometry-to-flow diffusion model is superior to the CNN model in predicting instantaneous flow fields and handling complex geometries. Quantitative analysis of the model accuracy and divergence in the fields demonstrate the high robustness of the diffusion model, indicating that the diffusion model learns physical laws implicitly.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in deep learning-based deepfake detection methods, particularly with diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, there is a growing demand for real-world applications to detect unseen individuals, deepfake techniques, and scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a Prototype-based Unified Framework for Deepfake Detection (PUDD). PUDD offers a detection system based on similarity, comparing input data against known prototypes for video classification and identifying potential deepfakes or previously unseen classes by analyzing drops in similarity. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) PUDD achieves an accuracy of 95.1% on Celeb-DF, outperforming state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods; (2) PUDD leverages image classification as the upstream task during training, demonstrating promising performance in both image classification and deepfake detection tasks during inference; (3) PUDD requires only 2.7 seconds for retraining on new data and emits 10$^{5}$ times less carbon compared to the state-of-the-art model, making it significantly more environmentally friendly.</p></details> | CVPR2024 |
| **[Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Diffusion Models with Energy-Based Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00626v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is released at https://github.com/swyoon/Diffusion-by-MaxEntIRL</p></details> |

This transition highlights the critical need for accurate MR-to-CT image synthesis, which is essential for precise proton dose calculations. Our research introduces the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Models (DSBM), an innovative approach for high-quality MR-to-CT synthesis. DSBM learns the nonlinear diffusion processes between MR and CT data distributions. This method improves upon traditional diffusion models by initiating synthesis from the prior distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution, enhancing both generation quality and efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of DSBM on a head and neck cancer dataset, demonstrating its superiority over traditional image synthesis methods through both image-level and dosimetric-level evaluations. The effectiveness of DSBM in MR-based proton treatment planning highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various clinical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on the use of Computers in Radiation therapy (ICCR)</p></details> |
| **[Consistency Purification: Effective and Efficient Diffusion Purification towards Certified Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00623v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Purification, purifying noised images with diffusion models, has been widely used for enhancing certified robustness via randomized smoothing. However, existing frameworks often grapple with the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. While the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) offers an efficient single-step purification, it falls short in ensuring purified images reside on the data manifold. Conversely, the Stochastic Diffusion Model effectively places purified images on the data manifold but demands solving cumbersome stochastic differential equations, while its derivative, the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE), though solving simpler ordinary differential equations, still requires multiple computational steps. In this work, we demonstrated that an ideal purification pipeline should generate the purified images on the data manifold that are as much semantically aligned to the original images for effectiveness in one step for efficiency. Therefore, we introduced Consistency Purification, an efficiency-effectiveness Pareto superior purifier compared to the previous work. Consistency Purification employs the consistency model, a one-step generative model distilled from PF-ODE, thus can generate on-manifold purified images with a single network evaluation. However, the consistency model is designed not for purification thus it does not inherently ensure semantic alignment between purified and original images. To resolve this issue, we further refine it through Consistency Fine-tuning with LPIPS loss, which enables more aligned semantic meaning while keeping the purified images on data manifold. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Consistency Purification framework achieves state-of the-art certified robustness and efficiency compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDFormer:When Degradation Prediction Embraces Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07648v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Blind image Super-Resolution (BSR) methods focus on estimating either kernel or degradation information, but have long overlooked the essential content details. In this paper, we propose a novel BSR approach, Content-aware Degradation-driven Transformer (CDFormer), to capture both degradation and content representations. However, low-resolution images cannot provide enough content details, and thus we introduce a diffusion-based module $CDFormer_{diff}$ to first learn Content Degradation Prior (CDP) in both low- and high-resolution images, and then approximate the real distribution given only low-resolution information. Moreover, we apply an adaptive SR network $CDFormer_{SR}$ that effectively utilizes CDP to refine features. Compared to previous diffusion-based SR methods, we treat the diffusion model as an estimator that can overcome the limitations of expensive sampling time and excessive diversity. Experiments show that CDFormer can outperform existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under blind settings. Codes and models will be available at \href{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}{https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/CDFormer}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Diffusion Method: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Vibration Signal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07981v2)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful data generation capabilities in various research fields such as image generation. However, in the field of vibration signal generation, the criteria for evaluating the quality of the generated signal are different from that of image generation and there is a fundamental difference between them. At present, there is no research on the ability of diffusion model to generate vibration signal. In this paper, a Time Series Diffusion Method (TSDM) is proposed for vibration signal generation, leveraging the foundational principles of diffusion models. The TSDM uses an improved U-net architecture with attention block, ResBlock and TimeEmbedding to effectively segment and extract features from one-dimensional time series data. It operates based on forward diffusion and reverse denoising processes for time-series generation. Experimental validation is conducted using single-frequency, multi-frequency datasets, and bearing fault datasets. The results show that TSDM can accurately generate the single-frequency and multi-frequency features in the time series and retain the basic frequency features for the diffusion generation results of the bearing fault series. It is also found that the original DDPM could not generate high quality vibration signals, but the improved U-net in TSDM, which applied the combination of attention block and ResBlock, could effectively improve the quality of vibration signal generation. Finally, TSDM is applied to the small sample fault diagnosis of three public bearing fault datasets, and the results show that the accuracy of small sample fault diagnosis of the three datasets is improved by 32.380%, 18.355% and 9.298% at most, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This process demands sample-efficient optimization due to the high computational cost of function evaluations. While prior studies focus on forward approaches to learn surrogates for the unknown objective function, they struggle with high-dimensional inputs where valid inputs form a small subspace (e.g., valid protein sequences), which is common in real-world tasks. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in learning the high-dimensional data manifold. They have shown promising performance in black-box optimization tasks but only in offline settings. In this work, we propose diffusion-based inverse modeling for black-box optimization (Diff-BBO), the first inverse approach leveraging diffusion models for online BBO problem. Diff-BBO distinguishes itself from forward approaches through the design of acquisition function. Instead of proposing candidates in the design space, Diff-BBO employs a novel acquisition function Uncertainty-aware Exploration (UaE) to propose objective function values, which leverages the uncertainty of a conditional diffusion model to generate samples in the design space. Theoretically, we prove that using UaE leads to optimal optimization outcomes. Empirically, we redesign experiments on the Design-Bench benchmark for online settings and show that Diff-BBO achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenderBias-\emph{VL}: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Vision Language Models via Counterfactual Probing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00600v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been widely adopted in various applications; however, they exhibit significant gender biases. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate gender bias at the demographic group level, neglecting individual fairness, which emphasizes equal treatment of similar individuals. This research gap limits the detection of discriminatory behaviors, as individual fairness offers a more granular examination of biases that group fairness may overlook. For the first time, this paper introduces the GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark to evaluate occupation-related gender bias in LVLMs using counterfactual visual questions under individual fairness criteria. To construct this benchmark, we first utilize text-to-image diffusion models to generate occupation images and their gender counterfactuals. Subsequently, we generate corresponding textual occupation options by identifying stereotyped occupation pairs with high semantic similarity but opposite gender proportions in real-world statistics. This method enables the creation of large-scale visual question counterfactuals to expose biases in LVLMs, applicable in both multimodal and unimodal contexts through modifying gender attributes in specific modalities. Overall, our GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark comprises 34,581 visual question counterfactual pairs, covering 177 occupations. Using our benchmark, we extensively evaluate 15 commonly used open-source LVLMs (\eg, LLaVA) and state-of-the-art commercial APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro. Our findings reveal widespread gender biases in existing LVLMs. Our benchmark offers: (1) a comprehensive dataset for occupation-related gender bias evaluation; (2) an up-to-date leaderboard on LVLM biases; and (3) a nuanced understanding of the biases presented by these models. \footnote{The dataset and code are available at the \href{https://genderbiasvl.github.io/}{website}.}</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

It eliminates the need for pixel-level labels in training, offering a more cost-effective alternative to supervised methods. However, existing methods are not fully weakly-supervised because they heavily rely on costly pixel-level labels for hyperparameter tuning in inference. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Anomaly Segmentation with Forward Process of Diffusion Models (AnoFPDM), a fully weakly-supervised framework that operates without the need of pixel-level labels. Leveraging the unguided forward process as a reference for the guided forward process, we select hyperparameters such as the noise scale, the threshold for segmentation and the guidance strength. We aggregate anomaly maps from guided forward process, enhancing the signal strength of anomalous regions. Remarkably, our proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approaches, even without utilizing pixel-level labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: u...</summary><p>v2: updated introduction, experiments and supplementary material</p></details> |

However, prolonged scanning durations, among other issues, can limit availability and accessibility. In this work, we aim to substantially reduce scan times by leveraging prior scans of the same patient. These prior scans typically contain considerable shared information with the current scan, thereby enabling higher acceleration rates when appropriately utilized. We propose a prior informed reconstruction method with a trained diffusion model in conjunction with data-consistency steps. Our method can be trained with unlabeled image data, eliminating the need for a dataset of either k-space measurements or paired longitudinal scans as is required of other learning-based methods. We demonstrate superiority of our method over previously suggested approaches in effectively utilizing prior information without over-biasing prior consistency, which we validate on both an open-source dataset of healthy patients as well as several longitudinal cases of clinical interest.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore diffusion-based vision generalists, where we unify different types of dense prediction tasks as conditional image generation and re-purpose pre-trained diffusion models for it. However, directly applying off-the-shelf latent diffusion models leads to a quantization issue. Thus, we propose to perform diffusion in pixel space and provide a recipe for finetuning pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for dense vision tasks.

We investigate the ODE solvers used to solve the Probability Flow ODE and the impact they have on the the creation of face morphs. Additionally, we employ an alternative method for encoding images into the latent space of the Diffusion model by solving the Probability Flow ODE as time runs forwards. Our experiments show that we can reduce the NFE by upwards of 85% in the encoding process while experiencing only 1.6\% reduction in Mated Morph Presentation Match Rate (MMPMR). Likewise, we showed we could cut NFE, in the sampling process, in half with only a maximal reduction of 0.23% in MMPMR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a paper in IEEE Security and Privacy</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

However, this assumption does not hold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only partial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an approach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained 2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose a pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete human masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization stage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervision by Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human. Finally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further improve rendering quality on the less observed human body parts. We evaluate OccFusion on ZJU-MoCap and challenging OcMotion sequences and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the rendering of occluded humans.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we explore a novel perspective to tackle this problem, a process conceptualized as domain padding. This proposal aims to enrich the domain diversity by synthesizing intra- and inter-domain style data while maintaining robustness to class labels. We instantiate this concept using a conditional diffusion model and introduce a style-fused sampling strategy to enhance data generation diversity. In contrast to traditional condition-guided sampling, our style-fused sampling strategy allows for the flexible use of one or more random styles to guide data synthesis. This feature presents a notable advancement: it allows for the maximum utilization of possible permutations and combinations among existing styles to generate a broad spectrum of new style instances. Empirical evaluations on a broad range of datasets demonstrate that our generated data achieves remarkable diversity within the domain space. Both intra- and inter-domain generated data have proven to be significant and valuable, contributing to varying degrees of performance enhancements. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods in all human activity recognition tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2024)</p></details> |

| **[Stochastic Optimal Control Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02027v4)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest.

However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to system built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over different existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods typically require the training of models to encode motion cues or the fine-tuning of video diffusion models. However, these approaches often result in suboptimal motion generation when applied outside the trained domain. In this work, we propose MotionClone, a training-free framework that enables motion cloning from a reference video to control text-to-video generation. We employ temporal attention in video inversion to represent the motions in the reference video and introduce primary temporal-attention guidance to mitigate the influence of noisy or very subtle motions within the attention weights. Furthermore, to assist the generation model in synthesizing reasonable spatial relationships and enhance its prompt-following capability, we propose a location-aware semantic guidance mechanism that leverages the coarse location of the foreground from the reference video and original classifier-free guidance features to guide the video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionClone exhibits proficiency in both global camera motion and local object motion, with notable superiority in terms of motion fidelity, textual alignment, and temporal consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, https://bujiazi.github.io/motionclone.github.io/</p></details> |

Our key insight is to adapt a 2D diffusion model, which is trained on web-scale images, to generate consistent multi-view color (RGB) and depth (D) images across different locations of the scene. Specifically, the RGB-D images are generated autoregressively in a batch-wise manner along sampled locations based on the floorplan, where previously generated images are used as condition to the diffusion model to produce images at nearby locations. The global floorplan and attention design in the diffusion model ensures the consistency of the generated images, from which a 3D scene can be reconstructed. Through extensive evaluation on the 3D-Front dataset, we demonstrate that HouseCraft can generate high-quality house-scale 3D scenes. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of different design choices. We will release our code and model weights. Project page: https://neu-vi.github.io/houseCrafter/</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Diffusion Prior for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07015v4)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to leverage prior knowledge encapsulated in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for blind super-resolution (SR). Specifically, by employing our time-aware encoder, we can achieve promising restoration results without altering the pre-trained synthesis model, thereby preserving the generative prior and minimizing training cost. To remedy the loss of fidelity caused by the inherent stochasticity of diffusion models, we employ a controllable feature wrapping module that allows users to balance quality and fidelity by simply adjusting a scalar value during the inference process. Moreover, we develop a progressive aggregation sampling strategy to overcome the fixed-size constraints of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling adaptation to resolutions of any size. A comprehensive evaluation of our method using both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates its superiority over current state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[HAITCH: A Framework for Distortion and Motion Correction in Fetal Multi-Shell Diffusion-Weighted MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20042v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is pivotal for probing the microstructure of the rapidly-developing fetal brain. However, fetal motion during scans and its interaction with magnetic field inhomogeneities result in artifacts and data scattering across spatial and angular domains. The effects of those artifacts are more pronounced in high-angular resolution fetal dMRI, where signal-to-noise ratio is very low. Those effects lead to biased estimates and compromise the consistency and reliability of dMRI analysis. This work presents HAITCH, the first and the only publicly available tool to correct and reconstruct multi-shell high-angular resolution fetal dMRI data. HAITCH offers several technical advances that include a blip-reversed dual-echo acquisition for dynamic distortion correction, advanced motion correction for model-free and robust reconstruction, optimized multi-shell design for enhanced information capture and increased tolerance to motion, and outlier detection for improved reconstruction fidelity. The framework is open-source, flexible, and can be used to process any type of fetal dMRI data including single-echo or single-shell acquisitions, but is most effective when used with multi-shell multi-echo fetal dMRI data that cannot be processed with any of the existing tools. Validation experiments on real fetal dMRI scans demonstrate significant improvements and accurate correction across diverse fetal ages and motion levels. HAITCH successfully removes artifacts and reconstructs high-fidelity fetal dMRI data suitable for advanced diffusion modeling, including fiber orientation distribution function estimation. These advancements pave the way for more reliable analysis of the fetal brain microstructure and tractography under challenging imaging conditions.</p></details> |  |

Despite the field of explainable AI making strides in interpreting machine learning models, understanding latent variables in generative models remains challenging. This paper introduces LatentExplainer, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. LatentExplainer tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. By perturbing latent variables and interpreting changes in generated data, the framework provides a systematic approach to understanding and controlling the data generation process, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of deep generative models. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations of latent variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deceptive Diffusion: Generating Synthetic Adversarial Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19807v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the concept of deceptive diffusion -- training a generative AI model to produce adversarial images. Whereas a traditional adversarial attack algorithm aims to perturb an existing image to induce a misclassificaton, the deceptive diffusion model can create an arbitrary number of new, misclassified images that are not directly associated with training or test images. Deceptive diffusion offers the possibility of strengthening defence algorithms by providing adversarial training data at scale, including types of misclassification that are otherwise difficult to find. In our experiments, we also investigate the effect of training on a partially attacked data set. This highlights a new type of vulnerability for generative diffusion models: if an attacker is able to stealthily poison a portion of the training data, then the resulting diffusion model will generate a similar proportion of misleading outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Generative Replay for Task-Incremental Segmentation with Concurrent Appearance and Semantic Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19796v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalist segmentation models are increasingly favored for diverse tasks involving various objects from different image sources. Task-Incremental Learning (TIL) offers a privacy-preserving training paradigm using tasks arriving sequentially, instead of gathering them due to strict data sharing policies. However, the task evolution can span a wide scope that involves shifts in both image appearance and segmentation semantics with intricate correlation, causing concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting. To solve this issue, we propose a Comprehensive Generative Replay (CGR) framework that restores appearance and semantic knowledge by synthesizing image-mask pairs to mimic past task data, which focuses on two aspects: modeling image-mask correspondence and promoting scalability for diverse tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel Bayesian Joint Diffusion (BJD) model for high-quality synthesis of image-mask pairs with their correspondence explicitly preserved by conditional denoising. Furthermore, we develop a Task-Oriented Adapter (TOA) that recalibrates prompt embeddings to modulate the diffusion model, making the data synthesis compatible with different tasks. Experiments on incremental tasks (cardiac, fundus and prostate segmentation) show its clear advantage for alleviating concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting.

Despite significant advancements made by recent neural solvers, their limited expressiveness does not conform well to the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has pivoted towards diffusion models, they require simulating a Markov chain with many steps to produce a sample, which is time-consuming and does not meet the efficiency requirement of real applications, especially at scale. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is two-pronged: Firstly, it achieves rapid denoising of solutions through an analytically solvable form, allowing for direct sampling from the solution space with very few reverse-time steps, thereby drastically reducing inference time. Secondly, DISCO enhances solution quality by restricting the sampling space to a more constrained, meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while still preserving the inherent multi-modality of the output probabilistic distributions. DISCO achieves state-of-the-art results on very large Traveling Salesman Problems with 10000 nodes and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with its per-instance denoising time up to 44.8 times faster. Through further combining a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can be generalized to solve arbitrary-scale problem instances off the shelf, even outperforming models trained specifically on corresponding scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141v3)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |
| **[AlignIT: Enhancing Prompt Alignment in Customization of Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18893v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of customizing text-to-image diffusion models with user-supplied reference images. Given new prompts, the existing methods can capture the key concept from the reference images but fail to align the generated image with the prompt. In this work, we seek to address this key issue by proposing new methods that can easily be used in conjunction with existing customization methods that optimize the embeddings/weights at various intermediate stages of the text encoding process. The first contribution of this paper is a dissection of the various stages of the text encoding process leading up to the conditioning vector for text-to-image models. We take a holistic view of existing customization methods and notice that key and value outputs from this process differs substantially from their corresponding baseline (non-customized) models (e.g., baseline stable diffusion). While this difference does not impact the concept being customized, it leads to other parts of the generated image not being aligned with the prompt. Further, we also observe that these keys and values allow independent control various aspects of the final generation, enabling semantic manipulation of the output. Taken together, the features spanning these keys and values, serve as the basis for our next contribution where we fix the aforementioned issues with existing methods. We propose a new post-processing algorithm, AlignIT, that infuses the keys and values for the concept of interest while ensuring the keys and values for all other tokens in the input prompt are unchanged. Our proposed method can be plugged in directly to existing customization methods, leading to a substantial performance improvement in the alignment of the final result with the input prompt while retaining the customization quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Linguistic control enables effective content creation, but struggles with fine-grained control over image generation. This challenge has been explored, to a great extent, by incorporating additional user-supplied spatial conditions, such as depth maps and edge maps, into pre-trained T2I models through extra encoding. However, multi-control image synthesis still faces several challenges. Specifically, current approaches are limited in handling free combinations of diverse input control signals, overlook the complex relationships among multiple spatial conditions, and often fail to maintain semantic alignment with provided textual prompts. This can lead to suboptimal user experiences. To address these challenges, we propose AnyControl, a multi-control image synthesis framework that supports arbitrary combinations of diverse control signals. AnyControl develops a novel Multi-Control Encoder that extracts a unified multi-modal embedding to guide the generation process. This approach enables a holistic understanding of user inputs, and produces high-quality, faithful results under versatile control signals, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

First, we investigate the application of network bending, the process of applying transforms within the layers of a generative network, to image generation diffusion models by utilizing a range of point-wise, tensor-wise, and morphological operators. We identify a number of visual effects that result from various operators, including some that are not easily recreated with standard image editing tools. We find that this process allows for continuous, fine-grain control of image generation which can be helpful for creative applications. Next, we generate music-reactive videos using Stable Diffusion by passing audio features as parameters to network bending operators. Finally, we comment on certain transforms which radically shift the image and the possibilities of learning more about the latent space of Stable Diffusion based on these transforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx24), for additional image and video examples see https://dzluke.github.io/DAFX2024/</p></details> |

IXC-2.5 excels in various text-image comprehension and composition applications, achieving GPT-4V level capabilities with merely 7B LLM backend. Trained with 24K interleaved image-text contexts, it can seamlessly extend to 96K long contexts via RoPE extrapolation. This long-context capability allows IXC-2.5 to excel in tasks requiring extensive input and output contexts. Compared to its previous 2.0 version, InternLM-XComposer-2.5 features three major upgrades in vision-language comprehension: (1) Ultra-High Resolution Understanding, (2) Fine-Grained Video Understanding, and (3) Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialogue. In addition to comprehension, IXC-2.5 extends to two compelling applications using extra LoRA parameters for text-image composition: (1) Crafting Webpages and (2) Composing High-Quality Text-Image Articles. IXC-2.5 has been evaluated on 28 benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source state-of-the-art models on 16 benchmarks. It also surpasses or competes closely with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on 16 key tasks.

Since the visual scenes in physical worlds are structured with complex relations between objects, BACON breaks down annotations into basic minimum elements and presents them in a graph structure. Element-wise style enables easy understanding, and structural composition liberates difficult locating. Careful prompt design births the BACON captions with the help of public-available VLMs and segmentation methods. In this way, we gather a dataset with 100K annotated images, which endow VLMs with remarkable capabilities, such as accurately generating BACON, transforming prompts into BACON format, envisioning scenarios in the style of BACONr, and dynamically modifying elements within BACON through interactive dialogue and more. Wide representative experiments, including detection, VQA, and image generation tasks, tell BACON as a lifeline to achieve previous out-of-reach tasks or excel in their current cutting-edge solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Attribute Prompting for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00219v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like CLIP, exhibit strong generalization ability to downstream tasks but struggle in few-shot scenarios. Existing prompting techniques primarily focus on global text and image representations, yet overlooking multi-modal attribute characteristics. This limitation hinders the model's ability to perceive fine-grained visual details and restricts its generalization ability to a broader range of unseen classes. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-modal Attribute Prompting method (MAP) by jointly exploring textual attribute prompting, visual attribute prompting, and attribute-level alignment. The proposed MAP enjoys several merits. First, we introduce learnable visual attribute prompts enhanced by textual attribute semantics to adaptively capture visual attributes for images from unknown categories, boosting fine-grained visual perception capabilities for CLIP. Second, the proposed attribute-level alignment complements the global alignment to enhance the robustness of cross-modal alignment for open-vocabulary objects. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish cross-modal attribute-level alignment for CLIP-based few-shot adaptation. Extensive experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViG-Bias: Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01996v2)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of machine learning models in critical decision making processes has underscored the need for bias discovery and mitigation strategies. Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is not straightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hidden spurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely on bias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroups of data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender or ethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes defining semantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible to know a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visual recognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups by leveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction of cross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions to characterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In this work, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generated via GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such bias discovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effective technique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks to improve both, discovery and mitigation performance. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that incorporating visual explanations enhances existing techniques like DOMINO, FACTS and Bias-to-Text, across several challenging datasets, including CelebA, Waterbirds, and NICO++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge.

While a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance, further adaptation of the model to downstream tasks leads to undesirable degradation for OOD data. In this work, we introduce Sparse Adaptation for Fine-Tuning (SAFT), a method that prevents fine-tuning from forgetting the general knowledge in the pre-trained model. SAFT only updates a small subset of important parameters whose gradient magnitude is large, while keeping the other parameters frozen. SAFT is straightforward to implement and conceptually simple. Extensive experiments show that with only 0.1% of the model parameters, SAFT can significantly improve the performance of CLIP. It consistently outperforms baseline methods across several benchmarks. On the few-shot learning benchmark of ImageNet and its variants, SAFT gives a gain of 5.15% on average over the conventional fine-tuning method in OOD settings.</p></details> |  |

While most large vision-language models (VLMs) focus on physical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal capabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a vision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,062 images depicting diverse real-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them. Given an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to address the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason underlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the limitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further analyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and predicted human values.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Can 3D Vision-Language Models Truly Understand Natural Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14760v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in 3D vision-language (3D-VL) tasks have opened up new avenues for human interaction with embodied agents or robots using natural language. Despite this progress, we find a notable limitation: existing 3D-VL models exhibit sensitivity to the styles of language input, struggling to understand sentences with the same semantic meaning but written in different variants. This observation raises a critical question: Can 3D vision-language models truly understand natural language? To test the language understandability of 3D-VL models, we first propose a language robustness task for systematically assessing 3D-VL models across various tasks, benchmarking their performance when presented with different language style variants. Importantly, these variants are commonly encountered in applications requiring direct interaction with humans, such as embodied robotics, given the diversity and unpredictability of human language. We propose a 3D Language Robustness Dataset, designed based on the characteristics of human language, to facilitate the systematic study of robustness. Our comprehensive evaluation uncovers a significant drop in the performance of all existing models across various 3D-VL tasks. Even the state-of-the-art 3D-LLM fails to understand some variants of the same sentences. Further in-depth analysis suggests that the existing models have a fragile and biased fusion module, which stems from the low diversity of the existing dataset. Finally, we propose a training-free module driven by LLM, which improves language robustness. Datasets and code will be available at github.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/VincentDENGP/3D-LR</p></details> |

Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.</p></details> |  |

LoCoVQA augments test examples for mathematical reasoning, VQA, and character recognition tasks with increasingly long visual contexts composed of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution distractor images. Across these tasks, a diverse set of VLMs rapidly lose performance as the visual context length grows, often exhibiting a striking logarithmic decay trend. This test assesses how well VLMs can ignore irrelevant information when answering queries -- a task that is quite easy for language models (LMs) in the text domain -- demonstrating that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack this essential capability for many long-context applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2024; Project Page:https://github.com/mrwu-mac/R-Bench</p></details> |
| **[MedVH: Towards Systematic Evaluation of Hallucination for Large Vision Language Models in the Medical Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02730v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved superior performance in various tasks on natural image and text data, which inspires a large amount of studies for LVLMs fine-tuning and training. Despite their advancements, there has been scant research on the robustness of these models against hallucination when fine-tuned on smaller datasets. In this study, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, the Medical Visual Hallucination Test (MedVH), to evaluate the hallucination of domain-specific LVLMs. MedVH comprises five tasks to evaluate hallucinations in LVLMs within the medical context, which includes tasks for comprehensive understanding of textual and visual input, as well as long textual response generation. Our extensive experiments with both general and medical LVLMs reveal that, although medical LVLMs demonstrate promising performance on standard medical tasks, they are particularly susceptible to hallucinations, often more so than the general models, raising significant concerns about the reliability of these domain-specific models. For medical LVLMs to be truly valuable in real-world applications, they must not only accurately integrate medical knowledge but also maintain robust reasoning abilities to prevent hallucination. Our work paves the way for future evaluations of these studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light-weight Fine-tuning Method for Defending Adversarial Noise in Pre-trained Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02716v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has shown remarkable capabilities in medical image and textual depiction synergy. Nevertheless, many pre-training datasets are restricted by patient privacy concerns, potentially containing noise that can adversely affect downstream performance. Moreover, the growing reliance on multi-modal generation exacerbates this issue because of its susceptibility to adversarial attacks. To investigate how VLMs trained on adversarial noisy data perform on downstream medical tasks, we first craft noisy upstream datasets using multi-modal adversarial attacks. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unveil that moderate noise enhances model robustness and transferability, but increasing noise levels negatively impact downstream task performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose rectify adversarial noise (RAN) framework, a recipe designed to effectively defend adversarial attacks and rectify the influence of upstream noise during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commonsense Reasoning for Legged Robot Adaptation with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02666v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots are physically capable of navigating a diverse variety of environments and overcoming a wide range of obstructions. For example, in a search and rescue mission, a legged robot could climb over debris, crawl through gaps, and navigate out of dead ends. However, the robot's controller needs to respond intelligently to such varied obstacles, and this requires handling unexpected and unusual scenarios successfully. This presents an open challenge to current learning methods, which often struggle with generalization to the long tail of unexpected situations without heavy human supervision. To address this issue, we investigate how to leverage the broad knowledge about the structure of the world and commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to aid legged robots in handling difficult, ambiguous situations. We propose a system, VLM-Predictive Control (VLM-PC), combining two key components that we find to be crucial for eliciting on-the-fly, adaptive behavior selection with VLMs: (1) in-context adaptation over previous robot interactions and (2) planning multiple skills into the future and replanning. We evaluate VLM-PC on several challenging real-world obstacle courses, involving dead ends and climbing and crawling, on a Go1 quadruped robot. Our experiments show that by reasoning over the history of interactions and future plans, VLMs enable the robot to autonomously perceive, navigate, and act in a wide range of complex scenarios that would otherwise require environment-specific engineering or human guidance.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Our findings show that geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts improve VL performance on lower-income data and favor the retrieval of topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households. From our analyses, we identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements.

| **[D-Rax: Domain-specific Radiologic assistant leveraging multi-modal data and eXpert model predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02604v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision language models (VLMs) have progressed incredibly from research to applicability for general-purpose use cases. LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Visual Storytelling with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02586v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual storytelling is an emerging field that combines images and narratives to create engaging and contextually rich stories. Despite its potential, generating coherent and emotionally resonant visual stories remains challenging due to the complexity of aligning visual and textual information. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) combined with instruction tuning to address these challenges. We introduce a new dataset comprising diverse visual stories, annotated with detailed captions and multimodal elements. Our method employs a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model, enhancing its narrative generation capabilities. Quantitative evaluations using GPT-4 and qualitative human assessments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, achieving higher scores in narrative coherence, relevance, emotional depth, and overall quality. The results underscore the effectiveness of instruction tuning and the potential of LLMs/LVLMs in advancing visual storytelling.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Conceptual Codebook Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02350v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Conceptual Codebook Learning (CoCoLe), a novel fine-tuning method for vision-language models (VLMs) to address the challenge of improving the generalization capability of VLMs while fine-tuning them on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. We recognize that visual concepts, such as textures, shapes, and colors are naturally transferable across domains and play a crucial role in generalization tasks. Motivated by this interesting finding, we learn a conceptual codebook consisting of visual concepts as keys and conceptual prompts as values, which serves as a link between the image encoder's outputs and the text encoder's inputs. Specifically, for a given image, we leverage the codebook to identify the most relevant conceptual prompts associated with the class embeddings to perform the classification. Additionally, we incorporate a handcrafted concept cache as a regularization to alleviate the overfitting issues in low-shot scenarios. We observe that this conceptual codebook learning method is able to achieve enhanced alignment between visual and linguistic modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CoCoLe method remarkably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation settings, including base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization tasks. Detailed ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of each component in CoCoLe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why do LLaVA Vision-Language Models Reply to Images in English?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02333v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We uncover a surprising multilingual bias occurring in a popular class of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs). Including an image in the query to a LLaVA-style VLM significantly increases the likelihood of the model returning an English response, regardless of the language of the query. This paper investigates the causes of this loss with a two-pronged approach that combines extensive ablation of the design space with a mechanistic analysis of the models' internal representations of image and text inputs. Both approaches indicate that the issue stems in the language modelling component of the LLaVA model. Statistically, we find that switching the language backbone for a bilingual language model has the strongest effect on reducing this error. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that visual inputs are not mapped to a similar space as text ones, and that intervening on intermediary attention layers can reduce this bias. Our findings provide important insights to researchers and engineers seeking to understand the crossover between multimodal and multilingual spaces, and contribute to the goal of developing capable and inclusive VLMs for non-English contexts.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[ColPali: Efficient Document Retrieval with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01449v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Documents are visually rich structures that convey information through text, as well as tables, figures, page layouts, or fonts. While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically faster and end-to-end trainable.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-Modal Video Dialog State Tracking in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02218v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MST-MIXER - a novel video dialog model operating over a generic multi-modal state tracking scheme. Current models that claim to perform multi-modal state tracking fall short of two major aspects: (1) They either track only one modality (mostly the visual input) or (2) they target synthetic datasets that do not reflect the complexity of real-world in the wild scenarios. Our model addresses these two limitations in an attempt to close this crucial research gap. Specifically, MST-MIXER first tracks the most important constituents of each input modality. Then, it predicts the missing underlying structure of the selected constituents of each modality by learning local latent graphs using a novel multi-modal graph structure learning method. Subsequently, the learned local graphs and features are parsed together to form a global graph operating on the mix of all modalities which further refines its structure and node embeddings. Finally, the fine-grained graph node features are used to enhance the hidden states of the backbone Vision-Language Model (VLM). MST-MIXER achieves new state-of-the-art results on five challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

This narrow scope often overlooks a vast range of unexamined implicit associations, restricting the identification and, hence, mitigation of such biases. We address this gap by probing VLMs to (1) uncover hidden, implicit associations across 9 bias dimensions. We systematically explore diverse input and output modalities and (2) demonstrate how biased associations vary in their negativity, toxicity, and extremity. Our work (3) identifies subtle and extreme biases that are typically not recognized by existing methodologies. We make the Dataset of retrieved associations, (Dora), publicly available here https://github.com/chahatraj/BiasDora.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Fake News Detection and Manipulation Reasoning via Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02042v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fake news becomes a growing threat to information security and public opinion with the rapid sprawl of media manipulation. Therefore, fake news detection attracts widespread attention from academic community. Traditional fake news detection models demonstrate remarkable performance on authenticity binary classification but their ability to reason detailed faked traces based on the news content remains under-explored. Furthermore, due to the lack of external knowledge, the performance of existing methods on fact-related news is questionable, leaving their practical implementation unclear. In this paper, we propose a new multi-media research topic, namely manipulation reasoning. Manipulation reasoning aims to reason manipulations based on news content. To support the research, we introduce a benchmark for fake news detection and manipulation reasoning, referred to as Human-centric and Fact-related Fake News (HFFN). The benchmark highlights the centrality of human and the high factual relevance, with detailed manual annotations. HFFN encompasses four realistic domains with fake news samples generated through three manipulation approaches. Moreover, a Multi-modal news Detection and Reasoning langUage Model (M-DRUM) is presented not only to judge on the authenticity of multi-modal news, but also raise analytical reasoning about potential manipulations. On the feature extraction level, a cross-attention mechanism is employed to extract fine-grained fusion features from multi-modal inputs. On the reasoning level, a large vision-language model (LVLM) serves as the backbone to facilitate fact-related reasoning. A two-stage training framework is deployed to better activate the capacity of identification and reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) fake news detection models and powerful LVLMs like GPT-4 and LLaVA.</p></details> |  |
| **[SADL: An Effective In-Context Learning Method for Compositional Visual QA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01983v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) offer a novel capability for performing in-context learning (ICL) in Visual QA. When prompted with a few demonstrations of image-question-answer triplets, LVLMs have demonstrated the ability to discern underlying patterns and transfer this latent knowledge to answer new questions about unseen images without the need for expensive supervised fine-tuning. However, designing effective vision-language prompts, especially for compositional questions, remains poorly understood. Adapting language-only ICL techniques may not necessarily work because we need to bridge the visual-linguistic semantic gap: Symbolic concepts must be grounded in visual content, which does not share the syntactic linguistic structures. This paper introduces SADL, a new visual-linguistic prompting framework for the task. SADL revolves around three key components: SAmpling, Deliberation, and Pseudo-Labeling of image-question pairs. Given an image-question query, we sample image-question pairs from the training data that are in semantic proximity to the query. To address the compositional nature of questions, the deliberation step decomposes complex questions into a sequence of subquestions. Finally, the sequence is progressively annotated one subquestion at a time to generate a sequence of pseudo-labels. We investigate the behaviors of SADL under OpenFlamingo on large-scale Visual QA datasets, namely GQA, GQA-OOD, CLEVR, and CRIC. The evaluation demonstrates the critical roles of sampling in the neighborhood of the image, the decomposition of complex questions, and the accurate pairing of the subquestions and labels. These findings do not always align with those found in language-only ICL, suggesting fresh insights in vision-language settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[C3L: Content Correlated Vision-Language Instruction Tuning Data Generation via Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12752v2)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) is a critical training phase for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With the improving capabilities of open-source LVLMs, researchers have increasingly turned to generate VLIT data by using open-source LVLMs and achieved significant progress. However, such data generation approaches are bottlenecked by the following challenges: 1) Since multi-modal models tend to be influenced by prior language knowledge, directly using LVLMs to generate VLIT data would inevitably lead to low content relevance between generated data and images. 2) To improve the ability of the models to generate VLIT data, previous methods have incorporated an additional training phase to boost the generative capacity. This process hurts the generalization of the models to unseen inputs (i.e., "exposure bias" problem). In this paper, we propose a new Content Correlated VLIT data generation via Contrastive Learning (C3L). Specifically, we design a new content relevance module which enhances the content relevance between VLIT data and images by computing Image Instruction Correspondence Scores S(I2C). Moreover, a contrastive learning module is introduced to further boost the VLIT data generation capability of the LVLMs. A large number of automatic measures on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI-24 |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18844v3)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning enhances large vision-language models (LVLMs) but raises security risks through potential backdoor attacks due to their openness. Previous backdoor studies focus on enclosed scenarios with consistent training and testing instructions, neglecting the practical domain gaps that could affect attack effectiveness. This paper empirically examines the generalizability of backdoor attacks during the instruction tuning of LVLMs for the first time, revealing certain limitations of most backdoor strategies in practical scenarios. We quantitatively evaluate the generalizability of six typical backdoor attacks on image caption benchmarks across multiple LVLMs, considering both visual and textual domain offsets. Our findings indicate that attack generalizability is positively correlated with the backdoor trigger's irrelevance to specific images/models and the preferential correlation of the trigger pattern. Additionally, we modify existing backdoor attacks based on the above key observations, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-domain scenario generalizability (+86% attack success rate). Notably, even without access to the instruction datasets, a multimodal instruction set can be successfully poisoned with a very low poisoning rate (0.2%), achieving an attack success rate of over 97%. This paper underscores that even simple traditional backdoor strategies pose a serious threat to LVLMs, necessitating more attention and in-depth research.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such "in-the-wild" data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT's use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, ICRA 2024 VLMNM Workshop</p></details> |
| **[VSP: Assessing the dual challenges of perception and reasoning in spatial planning tasks for VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01863v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) are an exciting emerging class of language models (LMs) that have merged classic LM capabilities with those of image processing systems. However, the ways that these capabilities combine are not always intuitive and warrant direct investigation. One understudied capability in VLMs is visual spatial planning -- the ability to comprehend the spatial arrangements of objects and devise action plans to achieve desired outcomes in visual scenes. In our study, we introduce VSP, a benchmark that 1) evaluates the spatial planning capability in these models in general, and 2) breaks down the visual planning task into finer-grained sub-tasks, including perception and reasoning, and measure the LMs capabilities in these sub-tasks. Our evaluation shows that both open-source and private VLMs fail to generate effective plans for even simple spatial planning tasks. Evaluations on the fine-grained analytical tasks further reveal fundamental deficiencies in the models' visual perception and bottlenecks in reasoning abilities, explaining their worse performance in the general spatial planning tasks. Our work illuminates future directions for improving VLMs' abilities in spatial planning. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Visual-Spatial-Planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP the Divergence: Language-guided Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01842v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) has emerged as a popular solution to tackle the divergence between the labeled source and unlabeled target domains. Recently, some research efforts have been made to leverage large vision-language models, such as CLIP, and then fine-tune or learn prompts from them for addressing the challenging UDA task. In this work, we shift the gear to a new direction by directly leveraging CLIP to measure the domain divergence and propose a novel language-guided approach for UDA, dubbed as CLIP-Div. Our key idea is to harness CLIP to 1) measure the domain divergence via the acquired domain-agnostic distribution and 2) calibrate the target pseudo labels with language guidance, to effectively reduce the domain gap and improve the UDA model's generalization capability. Specifically, our major technical contribution lies in the proposed two novel language-guided domain divergence measurement losses: absolute divergence and relative divergence. These loss terms furnish precise guidelines for aligning the distributions of the source and target domains with the domain-agnostic distribution derived from CLIP. Additionally, we propose a language-guided pseudo-labeling strategy for calibrating the target pseudo labels. Buttressed by it, we show that a further implementation for self-training can enhance the UDA model's generalization capability on the target domain. CLIP-Div surpasses state-of-the-art CNN-based methods by a substantial margin, achieving a performance boost of +10.3% on Office-Home, +1.5% on Office-31, +0.2% on VisDA-2017, and +24.3% on DomainNet, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[μ-Bench: A Vision-Language Benchmark for Microscopy Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01791v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in microscopy have enabled the rapid generation of terabytes of image data in cell biology and biomedical research. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution for large-scale biological image analysis, enhancing researchers' efficiency, identifying new image biomarkers, and accelerating hypothesis generation and scientific discovery. However, there is a lack of standardized, diverse, and large-scale vision-language benchmarks to evaluate VLMs' perception and cognition capabilities in biological image understanding. To address this gap, we introduce {\mu}-Bench, an expert-curated benchmark encompassing 22 biomedical tasks across various scientific disciplines (biology, pathology), microscopy modalities (electron, fluorescence, light), scales (subcellular, cellular, tissue), and organisms in both normal and abnormal states. We evaluate state-of-the-art biomedical, pathology, and general VLMs on {\mu}-Bench and find that: i) current models struggle on all categories, even for basic tasks such as distinguishing microscopy modalities; ii) current specialist models fine-tuned on biomedical data often perform worse than generalist models; iii) fine-tuning in specific microscopy domains can cause catastrophic forgetting, eroding prior biomedical knowledge encoded in their base model. iv) weight interpolation between fine-tuned and pre-trained models offers one solution to forgetting and improves general performance across biomedical tasks. We release {\mu}-Bench under a permissive license to accelerate the research and development of microscopy foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Feature Distillation with Object-Centric Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18742v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding natural language to the physical world is a ubiquitous topic with a wide range of applications in computer vision and robotics. Recently, 2D vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely popularized, due to their impressive capabilities for open-vocabulary grounding in 2D images. Recent works aim to elevate 2D CLIP features to 3D via feature distillation, but either learn neural fields that are scene-specific and hence lack generalization, or focus on indoor room scan data that require access to multiple camera views, which is not practical in robot manipulation scenarios. Additionally, related methods typically fuse features at pixel-level and assume that all camera views are equally informative. In this work, we show that this approach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy, as well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate uninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at object-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D features, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered tabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances, which we make publicly available. We show that our method reconstructs 3D CLIP features with improved grounding capacity and spatial consistency, while doing so from single-view RGB-D, thus departing from the assumption of multiple camera views at test time. Finally, we show that our approach can generalize to novel tabletop domains and be re-purposed for 3D instance segmentation without fine-tuning, and demonstrate its utility for language-guided robotic grasping in clutter</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended language instructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, most prompt learning methods trade-off between classification accuracy and robustness, e.g. in domain generalization or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. In this work, we introduce Global-Local Prompts (GalLoP), a new prompt learning method that learns multiple diverse prompts leveraging both global and local visual features. The training of the local prompts relies on local features with an enhanced vision-text alignment. To focus only on pertinent features, this local alignment is coupled with a sparsity strategy in the selection of the local features. We enforce diversity on the set of prompts using a new ``prompt dropout'' technique and a multiscale strategy on the local prompts. GalLoP outperforms previous prompt learning methods on accuracy on eleven datasets in different few shots settings and with various backbones.

| **[Patch-Prompt Aligned Bayesian Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09100v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt tuning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize the tuning process by minimizing the statistical distance between the visual patches and linguistic prompts, which pushes the stochastic label representations to faithfully capture diverse visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on four tasks: few-shot image recognition, base-to-new generalization, dataset transfer learning, and domain shifts. Extensive results over 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> | Accepted by UAI 2024 |

To address these challenges, we propose DreamPBR, a novel diffusion-based generative framework designed to create spatially-varying appearance properties guided by text and multi-modal controls, providing high controllability and diversity in material generation. Key to achieving diverse and high-quality PBR material generation lies in integrating the capabilities of recent large-scale vision-language models trained on billions of text-image pairs, along with material priors derived from hundreds of PBR material samples. We utilize a novel material Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to establish the mapping between albedo maps and the corresponding latent space. The latent representation is then decoded into full SVBRDF parameter maps using a rendering-aware PBR decoder. Our method supports tileable generation through convolution with circular padding. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-modal guidance module, which includes pixel-aligned guidance, style image guidance, and 3D shape guidance, to enhance the control capabilities of the material LDM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DreamPBR in material creation, showcasing its versatility and user-friendliness on a wide range of controllable generation and editing applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Jailbreak Vision Language Models via Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04031v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications. Existing jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing solely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when confronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features simultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes jailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we adversarially embed universally harmful perturbations in an image, guided by a few-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative inhibitions). This process ensures that image prompt LVLMs to respond positively to any harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the adversarial image, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular, we utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ chain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a feedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms other methods by large margins (+29.03% in attack success rate on average). Additionally, we showcase the potential of our attacks on black-box commercial LVLMs, such as Gemini and ChatGLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPT: Consistent Proxy Tuning for Black-box Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01155v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box tuning has attracted recent attention due to that the structure or inner parameters of advanced proprietary models are not accessible. Proxy-tuning provides a test-time output adjustment for tuning black-box language models. It applies the difference of the output logits before and after tuning a smaller white-box "proxy" model to improve the black-box model. However, this technique serves only as a decoding-time algorithm, leading to an inconsistency between training and testing which potentially limits overall performance. To address this problem, we introduce Consistent Proxy Tuning (CPT), a simple yet effective black-box tuning method. Different from Proxy-tuning, CPT additionally exploits the frozen large black-box model and another frozen small white-box model, ensuring consistency between training-stage optimization objective and test-time proxies. This consistency benefits Proxy-tuning and enhances model performance. Note that our method focuses solely on logit-level computation, which makes it model-agnostic and applicable to any task involving logit classification. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our CPT in both black-box tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across various datasets.

| **[Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01100v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Specifically, we find that causal attention generally causes models to favor distant content, while relative positional encodings like RoPE prefer nearby ones based on the analysis of retrieval-augmented question answering (QA). Further, our empirical study on object detection reveals that position bias is also present in vision-language models (VLMs). Based on the above analyses, we propose to ELIMINATE position bias caused by different input segment orders (e.g., options in LM-as-a-judge, retrieved documents in QA) in a TRAINING-FREE ZERO-SHOT manner. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between segments and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of segments instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the segment level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks where position bias widely exists, such as LM-as-a-judge and retrieval-augmented QA. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains in most cases, and makes Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview on the RewardBench reasoning subset.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

The cultural bias in the images makes these datasets unsuitable for evaluating VLMs in Chinese culture. To remedy this issue, we present a new Chinese Vision- Language Understanding Evaluation (CVLUE) benchmark dataset, where the selection of object categories and images is entirely driven by Chinese native speakers, ensuring that the source images are representative of Chinese culture. The benchmark contains four distinct VL tasks ranging from image-text retrieval to visual question answering, visual grounding and visual dialogue. We present a detailed statistical analysis of CVLUE and provide a baseline performance analysis with several open-source multilingual VLMs on CVLUE and its English counterparts to reveal their performance gap between English and Chinese. Our in-depth category-level analysis reveals a lack of Chinese cultural knowledge in existing VLMs. We also find that fine-tuning on Chinese culture-related VL datasets effectively enhances VLMs' understanding of Chinese culture.</p></details> |  |

While numerous surveys focus on conventional VAD methods, they often lack depth in exploring specific approaches and emerging trends. This survey explores deep learning-based VAD, expanding beyond traditional supervised training paradigms to encompass emerging weakly supervised, self-supervised, and unsupervised approaches. A prominent feature of this review is the investigation of core challenges within the VAD paradigms including large-scale datasets, features extraction, learning methods, loss functions, regularization, and anomaly score prediction. Moreover, this review also investigates the vision language models (VLMs) as potent feature extractors for VAD. VLMs integrate visual data with textual descriptions or spoken language from videos, enabling a nuanced understanding of scenes crucial for anomaly detection. By addressing these challenges and proposing future research directions, this review aims to foster the development of robust and efficient VAD systems leveraging the capabilities of VLMs for enhanced anomaly detection in complex real-world scenarios. This comprehensive analysis seeks to bridge existing knowledge gaps, provide researchers with valuable insights, and contribute to shaping the future of VAD research.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have demonstrated that cross-modal distillation can provide rich and useful knowledge for 3D data. However, like most deep learning models, the resultant 3D learning network is still vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially the iterative attack. In this work, we propose Dual Denoising, a novel framework for learning robust and well-generalized 3D representations from CLIP. It combines a denoising-based proxy task with a novel feature denoising network for 3D pre-training. Additionally, we propose utilizing parallel noise inference to enhance the generalization of point cloud features under cross domain settings. Experiments show that our model can effectively improve the representation learning performance and adversarial robustness of the 3D learning network under zero-shot settings without adversarial training. Our code is available at https://github.com/luoshuqing2001/Dual_Denoising.</p></details> |  |

In this field, generalization is a long-standing challenge, either to out-of-distribution scenes or from Sim to Real. In this paper, we propose NaVid, a video-based large vision language model (VLM), to mitigate such a generalization gap. NaVid makes the first endeavor to showcase the capability of VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art level navigation performance without any maps, odometers, or depth inputs. Following human instruction, NaVid only requires an on-the-fly video stream from a monocular RGB camera equipped on the robot to output the next-step action. Our formulation mimics how humans navigate and naturally gets rid of the problems introduced by odometer noises, and the Sim2Real gaps from map or depth inputs. Moreover, our video-based approach can effectively encode the historical observations of robots as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making and instruction following. We train NaVid with 510k navigation samples collected from continuous environments, including action-planning and instruction-reasoning samples, along with 763k large-scale web data. Extensive experiments show that NaVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in simulation environments and the real world, demonstrating superior cross-dataset and Sim2Real transfer. We thus believe our proposed VLM approach plans the next step for not only the navigation agents but also this research field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[GenderBias-\emph{VL}: Benchmarking Gender Bias in Vision Language Models via Counterfactual Probing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00600v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been widely adopted in various applications; however, they exhibit significant gender biases. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate gender bias at the demographic group level, neglecting individual fairness, which emphasizes equal treatment of similar individuals. This research gap limits the detection of discriminatory behaviors, as individual fairness offers a more granular examination of biases that group fairness may overlook. For the first time, this paper introduces the GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark to evaluate occupation-related gender bias in LVLMs using counterfactual visual questions under individual fairness criteria. To construct this benchmark, we first utilize text-to-image diffusion models to generate occupation images and their gender counterfactuals. Subsequently, we generate corresponding textual occupation options by identifying stereotyped occupation pairs with high semantic similarity but opposite gender proportions in real-world statistics. This method enables the creation of large-scale visual question counterfactuals to expose biases in LVLMs, applicable in both multimodal and unimodal contexts through modifying gender attributes in specific modalities. Overall, our GenderBias-\emph{VL} benchmark comprises 34,581 visual question counterfactual pairs, covering 177 occupations. Using our benchmark, we extensively evaluate 15 commonly used open-source LVLMs (\eg, LLaVA) and state-of-the-art commercial APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro. Our findings reveal widespread gender biases in existing LVLMs. Our benchmark offers: (1) a comprehensive dataset for occupation-related gender bias evaluation; (2) an up-to-date leaderboard on LVLM biases; and (3) a nuanced understanding of the biases presented by these models. \footnote{The dataset and code are available at the \href{https://genderbiasvl.github.io/}{website}.}</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |

Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier. However, such methods usually require a large amount of manually collected data with concept annotation, which is often scarce in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX) that leverage existing vision-language models (VLM) joint embedding space to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets. Specifically, we utilize textual concepts derived from chest radiography reports and a pre-trained chest radiography-based VLM to explain three common cardiothoracic pathologies. We demonstrate that the explanations generated by our method are semantically meaningful and faithful to underlying pathologies.</p></details> |  |

While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been widely adopted for this task, their effectiveness in capturing the unique characteristics of social media content remains unexplored. This paper critically examines the applicability of CLIP-based features in SMP prediction, focusing on the overlooked phenomenon of semantic inconsistency between images and text in social media posts. Through extensive analysis, we demonstrate that this inconsistency increases with post popularity, challenging the conventional use of VLM features. We provide a comprehensive investigation of semantic inconsistency across different popularity intervals and analyze the impact of VLM feature adaptation on SMP tasks. Our experiments reveal that incorporating inconsistency measures and adapted text features significantly improves model performance, achieving an SRC of 0.729 and an MAE of 1.227. These findings not only enhance SMP prediction accuracy but also provide crucial insights for developing more targeted approaches in social media analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission of the 7th Social Media Prediction Challenge</p></details> |

Various benchmarks have been proposed to test models' cultural inclusivity, but they have limited coverage of cultures and do not adequately assess cultural diversity across universal as well as culture-specific local concepts. To address these limitations, we introduce the GlobalRG benchmark, comprising two challenging tasks: retrieval across universals and cultural visual grounding. The former task entails retrieving culturally diverse images for universal concepts from 50 countries, while the latter aims at grounding culture-specific concepts within images from 15 countries. Our evaluation across a wide range of models reveals that the performance varies significantly across cultures -- underscoring the necessity for enhancing multicultural understanding in vision-language models.</p></details> | Under peer review |

Additionally, they can function as vision encoders when combined with large language models (LLMs) to support broader capabilities. Current efforts to train pathology VLMs rely on pathology image-text pairs from platforms like PubMed, YouTube, and Twitter, which provide limited, unscalable data with generally suboptimal image quality. In this work, we leverage large-scale WSI datasets like TCGA to extract numerous high-quality image patches. We then train a large multimodal model to generate captions for these images, creating PathGen-1.6M, a dataset containing 1.6 million high-quality image-caption pairs. Our approach involves multiple agent models collaborating to extract representative WSI patches, generating and refining captions to obtain high-quality image-text pairs. Extensive experiments show that integrating these generated pairs with existing datasets to train a pathology-specific CLIP model, PathGen-CLIP, significantly enhances its ability to analyze pathological images, with substantial improvements across nine pathology-related zero-shot image classification tasks and three whole-slide image tasks. Furthermore, we construct 200K instruction-tuning data based on PathGen-1.6M and integrate PathGen-CLIP with the Vicuna LLM to create more powerful multimodal models through instruction tuning. Overall, we provide a scalable pathway for high-quality data generation in pathology, paving the way for next-generation general pathology models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

In this paper, we propose LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework which formulates robot action policy as conversations, and provides improved responses when trained with auxiliary data that complements policy learning. LLMs with visual inputs, i.e., Vision Language Models (VLMs), have the capacity to process state information as visual-textual prompts and generate optimal policy decisions in text. To train such action policy VLMs, we first introduce an automated pipeline to generate diverse high-quality robotics instruction data from existing behavior cloning data. A VLM finetuned with the resulting collection of datasets based on a conversation-style formulation tailored for robotics tasks, can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions. Our experiments across multiple simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed LLaRA framework.

However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medical (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med across three major medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance with the utilization of only 9% of the medical data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

The problem is challenging, as reasoning data consisting of multiple steps of visual and language processing are barely available. To overcome the challenge, we first introduce a least-to-most visual reasoning paradigm, which interleaves steps of decomposing a question into sub-questions and invoking external tools for resolving sub-questions. Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct $50$k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised fine-tuning, which is capable of generally enhancing the reasoning abilities of a wide range of existing VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments indicate that the visual reasoner can consistently and significantly improve four VLMs on four VQA benchmarks.

It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and thus they employ a router to predict the routing for each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization direction of tokens. This can lead to severe optimization conflicts between different tokens within an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis. Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. Then, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination. As a plug-and-play method, it can be seamlessly applied to all existing LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks across four LVLMs have demonstrated significant improvements brought by our method, indicating its effectiveness and generality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACL 2024; 19 Pages, 15 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

However, there is still an opportunity to improve the quality, quantity, and diversity of robot demonstration data. Although vision-language models have been shown to automatically generate demonstration data, their utility has been limited to environments with privileged state information, they require hand-designed skills, and are limited to interactions with few object instances. We propose Manipulate-Anything, a scalable automated generation method for real-world robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work, our method can operate in real-world environments without any privileged state information, hand-designed skills, and can manipulate any static object. We evaluate our method using two setups. First, Manipulate-Anything successfully generates trajectories for all 5 real-world and 12 simulation tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods like VoxPoser. Second, Manipulate-Anything's demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations, or from data generated by VoxPoser and Code-As-Policies. We believe Manipulate-Anything can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://robot-ma.github.io/</p></details> |

While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

However, their high complexity and un-interpretable mode of operation hinders their confident deployment in real-world safety-critical tasks. This work targets ante hoc interpretability, and specifically Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs). Our goal is to design a framework that admits a highly interpretable decision making process with respect to human understandable concepts, on two levels of granularity. To this end, we propose a novel two-level concept discovery formulation leveraging: (i) recent advances in vision-language models, and (ii) an innovative formulation for coarse-to-fine concept selection via data-driven and sparsity-inducing Bayesian arguments. Within this framework, concept information does not solely rely on the similarity between the whole image and general unstructured concepts; instead, we introduce the notion of concept hierarchy to uncover and exploit more granular concept information residing in patch-specific regions of the image scene. As we experimentally show, the proposed construction not only outperforms recent CBM approaches, but also yields a principled framework towards interpetability.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSM-Adapter: Finetuning Vision-Language Segmentation Efficiently with Lightweight Blocks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06196v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained using large-scale open-domain images and text pairs have recently been adapted to develop Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow providing text prompts during inference to guide image segmentation. If robust and powerful VLSMs can be built for medical images, it could aid medical professionals in many clinical tasks where they must spend substantial time delineating the target structure of interest. VLSMs for medical images resort to fine-tuning base VLM or VLSM pretrained on open-domain natural image datasets due to fewer annotated medical image datasets; this fine-tuning is resource-consuming and expensive as it usually requires updating all or a significant fraction of the pretrained parameters. Recently, lightweight blocks called adapters have been proposed in VLMs that keep the pretrained model frozen and only train adapters during fine-tuning, substantially reducing the computing resources required. We introduce a novel adapter, VLSM-Adapter, that can fine-tune pretrained vision-language segmentation models using transformer encoders. Our experiments in widely used CLIP-based segmentation models show that with only 3 million trainable parameters, the VLSM-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art and is comparable to the upper bound end-to-end fine-tuning.

| **[RAVEN: Multitask Retrieval Augmented Vision-Language Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19150v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling of large language models to encode all the world's knowledge in model parameters is unsustainable and has exacerbated resource barriers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a potential solution, yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) is under explored. Existing methods focus on models designed for single tasks. Furthermore, they're limited by the need for resource intensive pre training, additional parameter requirements, unaddressed modality prioritization and lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines. This paper introduces RAVEN, a multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework that enhances base VLMs through efficient, task specific fine-tuning. By integrating retrieval augmented samples without the need for additional retrieval-specific parameters, we show that the model acquires retrieval properties that are effective across multiple tasks. Our results and extensive ablations across retrieved modalities for the image captioning and VQA tasks indicate significant performance improvements compared to non retrieved baselines +1 CIDEr on MSCOCO, +4 CIDEr on NoCaps and nearly a +3\% accuracy on specific VQA question types. This underscores the efficacy of applying RAG approaches to VLMs, marking a stride toward more efficient and accessible multimodal learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CELLO: Causal Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19131v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal reasoning is fundamental to human intelligence and crucial for effective decision-making in real-world environments. Despite recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs), their ability to comprehend causality remains unclear. Previous work typically focuses on commonsense causality between events and/or actions, which is insufficient for applications like embodied agents and lacks the explicitly defined causal graphs required for formal causal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fine-grained and unified definition of causality involving interactions between humans and/or objects. Building on the definition, we construct a novel dataset, CELLO, consisting of 14,094 causal questions across all four levels of causality: discovery, association, intervention, and counterfactual. This dataset surpasses traditional commonsense causality by including explicit causal graphs that detail the interactions between humans and objects. Extensive experiments on CELLO reveal that current LVLMs still struggle with causal reasoning tasks, but they can benefit significantly from our proposed CELLO-CoT, a causally inspired chain-of-thought prompting strategy. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses from this study provide valuable insights for future research. Our project page is at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CELLO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evidential Concept Embedding Models: Towards Reliable Concept Explanations for Skin Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19130v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the high stakes in medical decision-making, there is a compelling demand for interpretable deep learning methods in medical image analysis. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) have emerged as an active interpretable framework incorporating human-interpretable concepts into decision-making. However, their concept predictions may lack reliability when applied to clinical diagnosis, impeding concept explanations' quality. To address this, we propose an evidential Concept Embedding Model (evi-CEM), which employs evidential learning to model the concept uncertainty. Additionally, we offer to leverage the concept uncertainty to rectify concept misalignments that arise when training CBMs using vision-language models without complete concept supervision. With the proposed methods, we can enhance concept explanations' reliability for both supervised and label-efficient settings. Furthermore, we introduce concept uncertainty for effective test-time intervention. Our evaluation demonstrates that evi-CEM achieves superior performance in terms of concept prediction, and the proposed concept rectification effectively mitigates concept misalignments for label-efficient training.

However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 88.7% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 82.4% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Cross-domain Discriminability in Continual Learning of Vison-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18868v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has overcome the constraints of traditional CL, which only focuses on previously encountered classes. During the CL of VLMs, we need not only to prevent the catastrophic forgetting on incrementally learned knowledge but also to preserve the zero-shot ability of VLMs. However, existing methods require additional reference datasets to maintain such zero-shot ability and rely on domain-identity hints to classify images across different domains. In this study, we propose Regression-based Analytic Incremental Learning (RAIL), which utilizes a recursive ridge regression-based adapter to learn from a sequence of domains in a non-forgetting manner and decouple the cross-domain correlations by projecting features to a higher-dimensional space. Cooperating with a training-free fusion module, RAIL absolutely preserves the VLM's zero-shot ability on unseen domains without any reference data. Additionally, we introduce Cross-domain Task-Agnostic Incremental Learning (X-TAIL) setting. In this setting, a CL learner is required to incrementally learn from multiple domains and classify test images from both seen and unseen domains without any domain-identity hint. We theoretically prove RAIL's absolute memorization on incrementally learned domains. Experiment results affirm RAIL's state-of-the-art performance in both X-TAIL and existing Multi-domain Task-Incremental Learning settings. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models on Self-driving Corner Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10595v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have received widespread attention in advancing the interpretable self-driving. Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure to prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotation for human annotators, and for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all the open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://coda-dataset.github.io/coda-lm/</p></details> |

However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 8 advanced open-source LVLMs with 10 checkpoints are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released in \url{https://github.com/Benchmark-Dysca/Dysca}.</p></details> |  |

We bootstrap a multimodal dataset by extracting semantically meaningful image crops corresponding to words in the image captions of synthetically generated and publicly available text-image data. Our model, MUMU, is composed of a vision-language model encoder with a diffusion decoder and is trained on a single 8xH100 GPU node. Despite being only trained on crops from the same image, MUMU learns to compose inputs from different images into a coherent output. For example, an input of a realistic person and a cartoon will output the same person in the cartoon style, and an input of a standing subject and a scooter will output the subject riding the scooter. As a result, our model generalizes to tasks such as style transfer and character consistency. Our results show the promise of using multimodal models as general purpose controllers for image generation.</p></details> |  |

The latter is achieved by an unsupervised way to read localized semantic information from the pre-trained CLIP model. The resulting video object localization is entirely unsupervised apart from the implicit annotation contained in CLIP, and it is effectively the first unsupervised approach that yields good results on regular video benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023; Presented on CVPR 2024 Workshop CORR; Project Page:https://github.com/amazon-science/object-centric-vol</p></details> |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Med-MoE: Mixture of Domain-Specific Experts for Lightweight Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10237v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in general-purpose or domain-specific multimodal large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable progress for medical decision-making. However, they are designated for specific classification or generative tasks, and require model training or finetuning on large-scale datasets with sizeable parameters and tremendous computing, hindering their clinical utility across diverse resource-constrained scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight framework Med-MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) that tackles both discriminative and generative multimodal medical tasks. The learning of Med-MoE consists of three steps: multimodal medical alignment, instruction tuning and routing, and domain-specific MoE tuning. After aligning multimodal medical images with LLM tokens, we then enable the model for different multimodal medical tasks with instruction tuning, together with a trainable router tailored for expert selection across input modalities. Finally, the model is tuned by integrating the router with multiple domain-specific experts, which are selectively activated and further empowered by meta expert. Comprehensive experiments on both open- and close-end medical question answering (Med-VQA) and image classification tasks across datasets such as VQA-RAD, SLAKE and Path-VQA demonstrate that our model can achieve performance superior to or on par with state-of-the-art baselines, while only requiring approximately 30\%-50\% of activated model parameters. Extensive analysis and ablations corroborate the effectiveness and practical utility of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Pre-trained Models for FF-to-FFPE Histopathological Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18054v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The two primary types of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides in histopathology are Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) and Fresh Frozen (FF). FFPE slides offer high quality histopathological images but require a labor-intensive acquisition process. In contrast, FF slides can be prepared quickly, but the image quality is relatively poor. Our task is to translate FF images into FFPE style, thereby improving the image quality for diagnostic purposes. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-FFPE, a method for FF-to-FFPE histopathological image translation using a pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, we employ a one-step diffusion model as the generator and fine-tune it with LoRA adapters using adversarial learning objectives. To ensure that the model effectively captures both global structural information and local details, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module. This module utilizes two VAE encoders to extract features of varying image sizes and performs feature fusion before feeding them into the UNet. Furthermore, we utilize a pre-trained vision-language model for histopathology as the backbone for the discriminator to further improve performance We conducted FF-to-FFPE translation experiments on the TCGA-NSCLC datasets, and our method achieved better performance compared to other methods. The code and models are released at https://github.com/QilaiZhang/Diffusion-FFPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal foundation world models for generalist embodied agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18043v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalist embodied agents, able to solve multitudes of tasks in different domains is a long-standing problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be functional, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle toward developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learns the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking, GenRL exhibits strong multi-task generalization performance in several locomotion and manipulation domains. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free RL strategy, it lays the groundwork for foundation model-based RL for generalist embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructTA: Instruction-Tuned Targeted Attack for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01886v3)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their incredible capability in image understanding and response generation. However, this rich visual interaction also makes LVLMs vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this paper, we formulate a novel and practical targeted attack scenario that the adversary can only know the vision encoder of the victim LVLM, without the knowledge of its prompts (which are often proprietary for service providers and not publicly available) and its underlying large language model (LLM). This practical setting poses challenges to the cross-prompt and cross-model transferability of targeted adversarial attack, which aims to confuse the LVLM to output a response that is semantically similar to the attacker's chosen target text. To this end, we propose an instruction-tuned targeted attack (dubbed \textsc{InstructTA}) to deliver the targeted adversarial attack on LVLMs with high transferability. Initially, we utilize a public text-to-image generative model to "reverse" the target response into a target image, and employ GPT-4 to infer a reasonable instruction $\boldsymbol{p}^\prime$ from the target response. We then form a local surrogate model (sharing the same vision encoder with the victim LVLM) to extract instruction-aware features of an adversarial image example and the target image, and minimize the distance between these two features to optimize the adversarial example. To further improve the transferability with instruction tuning, we augment the instruction $\boldsymbol{p}^\prime$ with instructions paraphrased from GPT-4. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in targeted attack performance and transferability.

While these models enhance capabilities in natural language processing and visual interactive tasks, their growing adoption raises critical concerns regarding security and ethical alignment. This survey provides an extensive review of the emerging field of jailbreaking--deliberately circumventing the ethical and operational boundaries of LLMs and VLMs--and the consequent development of defense mechanisms. Our study categorizes jailbreaks into seven distinct types and elaborates on defense strategies that address these vulnerabilities. Through this comprehensive examination, we identify research gaps and propose directions for future studies to enhance the security frameworks of LLMs and VLMs. Our findings underscore the necessity for a unified perspective that integrates both jailbreak strategies and defensive solutions to foster a robust, secure, and reliable environment for the next generation of language models.

However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, and age. In this paper, we empirically investigate \emph{visual fairness} in several mainstream LVLMs and audit their performance disparities across sensitive demographic attributes, based on public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET). To disclose the visual bias in LVLMs, we design a fairness evaluation framework with direct questions and single-choice question-instructed prompts on visual question-answering/classification tasks. The zero-shot prompting results indicate that, despite enhancements in visual understanding, both open-source and closed-source LVLMs exhibit prevalent fairness issues across different instruct prompts and demographic attributes.</p></details> |  |

While these methods can perform well in their training environments, they lack the flexibility to transfer to new tasks. Instead, RL agents that can act over useful, temporally extended skills rather than low-level actions can learn new tasks more easily. Prior work in skill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills, which is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with heuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to transfer during downstream RL. Our approach, EXTRACT, instead utilizes pre-trained vision language models to extract a discrete set of semantically meaningful skills from offline data, each of which is parameterized by continuous arguments, without human supervision. This skill parameterization allows robots to learn new tasks by only needing to learn when to select a specific skill and how to modify its arguments for the specific task. We demonstrate through experiments in sparse-reward, image-based, robot manipulation environments that EXTRACT can more quickly learn new tasks than prior works, with major gains in sample efficiency and performance over prior skill-based RL.

While current VLMs have demonstrated strong vision-language understanding capabilities, their performance is still far from being satisfactory in planning tasks. At the same time, although classical task planners, such as PDDL-based, are strong in planning for long-horizon tasks, they do not work well in open worlds where unforeseen situations are common. In this paper, we propose a novel task planning and execution framework, called DKPROMPT, which automates VLM prompting using domain knowledge in PDDL for classical planning in open worlds. Results from quantitative experiments show that DKPROMPT outperforms classical planning, pure VLM-based and a few other competitive baselines in task completion rate.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing approaches, in our setting (i) the object of interest is specified solely through the textual prompt, (ii) no object model (e.g., CAD or video sequence) is required at inference, and (iii) the object is imaged from two RGBD viewpoints of different scenes. To operate in this setting, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a Vision-Language Model to segment the object of interest from the scenes and to estimate its relative 6D pose. The key of our approach is a carefully devised strategy to fuse object-level information provided by the prompt with local image features, resulting in a feature space that can generalize to novel concepts. We validate our approach on a new benchmark based on two popular datasets, REAL275 and Toyota-Light, which collectively encompass 34 object instances appearing in four thousand image pairs. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms both a well-established hand-crafted method and a recent deep learning-based baseline in estimating the relative 6D pose of objects in different scenes.

Given these properties, they are a natural fit for active learning (AL), which aims to maximize labeling efficiency. However, the full potential of foundation models has not been explored in the context of AL, specifically in the low-budget regime. In this work, we evaluate how foundation models influence three critical components of effective AL, namely, 1) initial labeled pool selection, 2) ensuring diverse sampling, and 3) the trade-off between representative and uncertainty sampling. We systematically study how the robust representations of foundation models (DINOv2, OpenCLIP) challenge existing findings in active learning. Our observations inform the principled construction of a new simple and elegant AL strategy that balances uncertainty estimated via dropout with sample diversity. We extensively test our strategy on many challenging image classification benchmarks, including natural images as well as out-of-domain biomedical images that are relatively understudied in the AL literature. We also provide a highly performant and efficient implementation of modern AL strategies (including our method) at https://github.com/sanketx/AL-foundation-models.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

| **[Rethinking Pruning for Vision-Language Models: Strategies for Effective Sparsity and Performance Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02424v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate information from multiple modalities and have shown remarkable success across various tasks. However, deploying large-scale VLMs in resource-constrained scenarios is challenging. Pruning followed by finetuning offers a potential solution but remains underexplored for VLMs. This study addresses two key questions: how to distribute sparsity across different modality-specific models, and how to restore the performance of pruned sparse VLMs. Our preliminary studies identified two effective pruning settings: applying the same sparsity to both vision and language models, and pruning only the language models. While LoRA finetuning aims to restore sparse models, it faces challenges due to incompatibility with sparse models, disrupting the pruned sparsity. To overcome these issues, we propose SparseLoRA, which applies sparsity directly to LoRA weights. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, including an 11.3\% boost under 2:4 sparsity and a 47.6\% enhancement under unstructured 70\% sparsity.

| **[WATT: Weight Average Test-Time Adaptation of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13875v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have yielded unprecedented performance for zero-shot image classification, yet their generalization capability may still be seriously challenged when confronted to domain shifts. In response, we present Weight Average Test-Time Adaptation (WATT) of CLIP, a pioneering approach facilitating full test-time adaptation (TTA) of this VLM. Our method employs a diverse set of templates for text prompts, augmenting the existing framework of CLIP. Predictions are utilized as pseudo labels for model updates, followed by weight averaging to consolidate the learned information globally. Furthermore, we introduce a text ensemble strategy, enhancing overall test performance by aggregating diverse textual cues. Our findings underscore the efficacy of WATT in enhancing performance across diverse datasets, including CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10.1, CIFAR-100-C, VisDA-C, and several other challenging datasets, effectively covering a wide range of domain shifts. Notably, these enhancements are achieved without necessitating additional model transformations or trainable modules. Moreover, compared to other Test-Time Adaptation methods, our approach can operate effectively with just a single image. Highlighting the potential of innovative test-time strategies, this research emphasizes their role in fortifying the adaptability of VLMs. The implementation is available at: \url{https://github.com/Mehrdad-Noori/WATT.git}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Quality of Hallucination Benchmarks for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17115v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress and outstanding performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in recent years, LVLMs have been plagued by the issue of hallucination, i.e., LVLMs tend to generate responses that are inconsistent with the corresponding visual inputs. To evaluate the degree of hallucination in LVLMs, previous works have proposed a series of benchmarks featuring different types of tasks and evaluation metrics. However, we find that the quality of the existing hallucination benchmarks varies, with some suffering from problems, e.g., inconsistent evaluation results under repeated tests, and misalignment with human evaluation. To this end, we propose a Hallucination benchmark Quality Measurement framework (HQM), which leverages various indicators to assess the reliability and validity of existing hallucination benchmarks separately. Specifically, for reliability we explore test-retest reliability and parallel-forms reliability, while for validity we examine criterion validity and coverage of hallucination types. Furthermore, based on the results of our quality measurement, we construct a High-Quality Hallucination Benchmark (HQH) for LVLMs. We conduct an extensive evaluation of over 10 representative LVLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini-Vision-Pro, to provide an in-depth analysis of the hallucination issues in existing models. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/HQHBench/HQHBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Versatile Backdoor Attack with Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible Triggers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00816v4)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be manipulated to exhibit specific behaviors when exposed to specific trigger patterns, without affecting their performance on benign samples, dubbed \textit{backdoor attack}. Currently, implementing backdoor attacks in physical scenarios still faces significant challenges. Physical attacks are labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the triggers are selected in a manual and heuristic way. Moreover, expanding digital attacks to physical scenarios faces many challenges due to their sensitivity to visual distortions and the absence of counterparts in the real world. To address these challenges, we define a novel trigger called the \textbf{V}isible, \textbf{S}emantic, \textbf{S}ample-Specific, and \textbf{C}ompatible (VSSC) trigger, to achieve effective, stealthy and robust simultaneously, which can also be effectively deployed in the physical scenario using corresponding objects. To implement the VSSC trigger, we propose an automated pipeline comprising three modules: a trigger selection module that systematically identifies suitable triggers leveraging large language models, a trigger insertion module that employs generative models to seamlessly integrate triggers into images, and a quality assessment module that ensures the natural and successful insertion of triggers through vision-language models. Extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness of the VSSC trigger. It can not only maintain robustness under visual distortions but also demonstrates strong practicality in the physical scenario. We hope that the proposed VSSC trigger and implementation approach could inspire future studies on designing more practical triggers in backdoor attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

However, CAD-rendered images for this alignment often lack realism and texture variation, compromising alignment robustness. Moreover, the volume discrepancy between 3D and 2D pretraining datasets highlights the need for effective strategies to transfer the representational abilities of VLMs to 3D learning. In this paper, we present OpenDlign, a novel open-world 3D model using depth-aligned images generated from a diffusion model for robust multimodal alignment. These images exhibit greater texture diversity than CAD renderings due to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model. By refining the depth map projection pipeline and designing depth-specific prompts, OpenDlign leverages rich knowledge in pre-trained VLM for 3D representation learning with streamlined fine-tuning. Our experiments show that OpenDlign achieves high zero-shot and few-shot performance on diverse 3D tasks, despite only fine-tuning 6 million parameters on a limited ShapeNet dataset. In zero-shot classification, OpenDlign surpasses previous models by 8.0% on ModelNet40 and 16.4% on OmniObject3D. Additionally, using depth-aligned images for multimodal alignment consistently enhances the performance of other state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | 12 pages |

To this end, we introduce ResMaster, a novel, training-free method that empowers resolution-limited diffusion models to generate high-quality images beyond resolution restrictions. Specifically, ResMaster leverages a low-resolution reference image created by a pre-trained diffusion model to provide structural and fine-grained guidance for crafting high-resolution images on a patch-by-patch basis. To ensure a coherent global structure, ResMaster meticulously aligns the low-frequency components of high-resolution patches with the low-resolution reference at each denoising step. For fine-grained guidance, tailored image prompts based on the low-resolution reference and enriched textual prompts produced by a vision-language model are incorporated. This approach could significantly mitigate local pattern distortions and improve detail refinement. Extensive experiments validate that ResMaster sets a new benchmark for high-resolution image generation and demonstrates promising efficiency.

| **[Evaluating Visual and Cultural Interpretation: The K-Viscuit Benchmark with Human-VLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16469v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To create culturally inclusive vision-language models (VLMs), the foremost requirement is developing a test benchmark that can diagnose the models' ability to respond to questions reflecting cultural elements. This paper addresses the necessity for such benchmarks, noting that existing research has relied on human annotators' manual efforts, which impedes diversity and efficiency. We propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing cultural VLM benchmarks to enhance diversity and efficiency. This pipeline leverages human-VLM collaboration, where VLMs generate questions based on guidelines, human-annotated examples, and image-wise relevant knowledge, which are then reviewed by native speakers for quality and cultural relevance. The effectiveness of our adaptable pipeline is demonstrated through a specific application: creating a dataset tailored to Korean culture, dubbed K-Viscuit. The resulting benchmark features two types of questions: Type 1 questions measure visual recognition abilities, while Type 2 assess fine-grained visual reasoning skills. This ensures a thorough diagnosis of VLM models across various aspects. Our evaluation using K-Viscuit revealed that open-source models notably lag behind proprietary models in understanding Korean culture, highlighting areas for improvement. We provided diverse analyses of VLM performance across different cultural aspects. Besides, we explored the potential of incorporating external knowledge retrieval to enhance the generation process, suggesting future directions for improving cultural interpretation ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable using natural language descriptions to support 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, these solutions underperform compared to model-based methods. In this work we present Horyon, an open-vocabulary VLM-based architecture that addresses relative pose estimation between two scenes of an unseen object, described by a textual prompt only. We use the textual prompt to identify the unseen object in the scenes and then obtain high-resolution multi-scale features. These features are used to extract cross-scene matches for registration. We evaluate our model on a benchmark with a large variety of unseen objects across four datasets, namely REAL275, Toyota-Light, Linemod, and YCB-Video. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, outperforming by 12.6 in Average Recall the previous best-performing approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[VCR: Visual Caption Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |

A Mechanistic Interpretability Pipeline for Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16320v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained community-spanning prominence due to their ability to integrate visual and textual inputs to perform complex tasks. Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models, including GPT4, Claude3.5, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

The need for few-shot learning and zero-shot learning techniques is crucial and arises from the limitations and challenges in traditional machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision methods where they require large amounts of data, plus the poor generalization of those traditional methods. Those techniques can give us prominent results by using only a few training sets reducing the required amounts of data and improving the generalization. This survey will highlight the recent papers of the last three years that introduce the usage of few-shot learning and zero-shot learning techniques in addressing the challenges mentioned earlier. In this paper we reviewed the Zero-shot, few-shot and regular object detection methods and categorized them in an understandable manner. Based on the comparison made within each category. It been found that the approaches are quite impressive. This integrated review of diverse papers on few-shot, zero-shot, and regular object detection reveals a shared focus on advancing the field through novel frameworks and techniques. A noteworthy observation is the scarcity of detailed discussions regarding the difficulties encountered during the development phase. Contributions include the introduction of innovative models, such as ZSD-YOLO and GTNet, often showcasing improvements with various metrics such as mean average precision (mAP),Recall@100 (RE@100), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and precision. These findings underscore a collective move towards leveraging vision-language models for versatile applications, with potential areas for future research including a more thorough exploration of limitations and domain-specific adaptations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Guided Multimodal Fusion Transformer for Semantic Location Prediction in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05760v2)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic location prediction aims to derive meaningful location insights from multimodal social media posts, offering a more contextual understanding of daily activities than using GPS coordinates. This task faces significant challenges due to the noise and modality heterogeneity in "text-image" posts. Existing methods are generally constrained by inadequate feature representations and modal interaction, struggling to effectively reduce noise and modality heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose a Similarity-Guided Multimodal Fusion Transformer (SG-MFT) for predicting the semantic locations of users from their multimodal posts. First, we incorporate high-quality text and image representations by utilizing a pre-trained large vision-language model. Then, we devise a Similarity-Guided Interaction Module (SIM) to alleviate modality heterogeneity and noise interference by incorporating both coarse-grained and fine-grained similarity guidance for improving modality interactions. Specifically, we propose a novel similarity-aware feature interpolation attention mechanism at the coarse-grained level, leveraging modality-wise similarity to mitigate heterogeneity and reduce noise within each modality. At the fine-grained level, we utilize a similarity-aware feed-forward block and element-wise similarity to further address the issue of modality heterogeneity. Finally, building upon pre-processed features with minimal noise and modal interference, we devise a Similarity-aware Fusion Module (SFM) to fuse two modalities with a cross-attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

To improve the interpretability of vision-language models such as CLIP, we propose a multi-modal information bottleneck (M2IB) approach that learns latent representations that compress irrelevant information while preserving relevant visual and textual features. We demonstrate how M2IB can be applied to attribution analysis of vision-language pretrained models, increasing attribution accuracy and improving the interpretability of such models when applied to safety-critical domains such as healthcare. Crucially, unlike commonly used unimodal attribution methods, M2IB does not require ground truth labels, making it possible to audit representations of vision-language pretrained models when multiple modalities but no ground-truth data is available. Using CLIP as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of M2IB attribution and show that it outperforms gradient-based, perturbation-based, and attention-based attribution methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 36 (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

Despite their progress, these models still encounter challenges in specialized medical image analysis, especially in recognizing subtle inter-class differences in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) lesion segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that customizes SAM for text-prompted DR lesion segmentation, termed TP-DRSeg. Our core idea involves exploiting language cues to inject medical prior knowledge into the vision-only segmentation network, thereby combining the advantages of different foundation models and enhancing the credibility of segmentation. Specifically, to unleash the potential of vision-language models in the recognition of medical concepts, we propose an explicit prior encoder that transfers implicit medical concepts into explicit prior knowledge, providing explainable clues to excavate low-level features associated with lesions. Furthermore, we design a prior-aligned injector to inject explicit priors into the segmentation process, which can facilitate knowledge sharing across multi-modality features and allow our framework to be trained in a parameter-efficient fashion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our framework over other traditional models and foundation model variants.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving this capability poses significant challenges due to the need for a system that can generalize from limited data to a wide range of tasks and environments. Existing methods rely on large, costly datasets and struggle with generalization. This paper introduces Grounded Equivariant Manipulation (GEM), a novel approach that leverages the generative capabilities of pre-trained vision-language models and geometric symmetries to facilitate few-shot and zero-shot learning for open-vocabulary robot manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate GEM's high sample efficiency and superior generalization across diverse pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and real-world experiments, showcasing its ability to adapt to novel instructions and unseen objects with minimal data requirements. GEM advances a significant step forward in the domain of language-conditioned robot control, bridging the gap between semantic understanding and action generation in robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates various LVLMs and pinpoints attention deficiency toward discriminative local image features as one root cause of object hallucinations. Specifically, LVLMs predominantly attend to prompt-independent global image features, while failing to capture prompt-relevant local features, consequently undermining the visual grounding capacity of LVLMs and leading to hallucinations. To this end, we propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates object hallucinations by exploring an ensemble of global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Our approach exhibits an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is reserved while irrelevant distractions are masked. With the augmented view, a calibrated decoding distribution can be derived by integrating generative global features from the original image and discriminative local features from the augmented image. Extensive experiments show that AGLA consistently mitigates object hallucinations and enhances general perception capability for LVLMs across various discriminative and generative benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Lackel/AGLA.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs from the Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10882v3)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/BPO.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Phase Accelerated Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13443v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-free prompt optimization methods have made significant strides in enhancing the performance of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompts as Auto-Optimized Training Hyperparameters: Training Best-in-Class IR Models from Scratch with 10 Gold Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11706v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a method for training small-scale (under 100M parameter) neural information retrieval models with as few as 10 gold relevance labels. The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Instructions and Demonstrations for Multi-Stage Language Model Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Model Programs, i.e. sophisticated pipelines of modular language model (LM) calls, are increasingly advancing NLP tasks, but they require crafting prompts that are jointly effective for all modules. We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy. We will release our new optimizers and benchmark in DSPy at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy</p></details> | <details><summary>Krist...</summary><p>Krista and Michael contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Fairer Preferences Elicit Improved Human-Aligned Large Language Model Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11370v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities as cost-effective and reference-free evaluators for assessing language generation quality. In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST): Integrating Human Feedback and Heuristic-based Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08702v3)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

| **[FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11811v2)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and three testing models.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[POEM: Interactive Prompt Optimization for Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03843v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive abilities for multimodal content comprehension and reasoning with proper prompting in zero- or few-shot settings. Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts.

| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18369v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |

However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The project code is available at https://vlislab22.github.io/BrightDreamer.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |

Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |

Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets.

However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods. Code is released at https://github.com/guozix/cbbt.</p></details> |  |

However, most Med-VLP models learn task-specific representations independently from scratch, thereby leading to great inflexibility when they work across multiple fine-tuning tasks. In this work, we propose UniDCP, a Unified medical vision-language model with Dynamic Cross-modal learnable Prompts, which can be plastically applied to multiple medical vision-language tasks. Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability in news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first framework for news recommendation that leverages the capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering. This system incorporates a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process, enhancing the LLM-based recommender's ability to align news content with user preferences and interests more effectively.

| **[PromptAgent: Strategic Planning with Language Models Enables Expert-level Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16427v2)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Highly effective, task-specific prompts are often heavily engineered by experts to integrate detailed instructions and domain insights based on a deep understanding of both instincts of large language models (LLMs) and the intricacies of the target task. However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Large Language Models for Intent-Driven Session Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07552v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-aware session recommendation (ISR) is pivotal in discerning user intents within sessions for precise predictions. Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.</p></details> |  |

This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |

Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[A Bayesian approach for prompt optimization in pre-trained language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00471v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary according to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a 'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a good performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the tradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.</p></details> |  |

With the ever-increasing power of GAI, especially the emergence of Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) that contain billions of parameters and prompt engineering methods (i.e., finding the best prompts for the given task), the application range of AIGC is rapidly expanding, covering various forms of information for human, systems, and networks, such as network designs, channel coding, and optimization solutions. In this article, we present the concept of mobile-edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX). Specifically, we first review the building blocks of AIGX, the evolution from AIGC to AIGX, as well as practical AIGX applications. Then, we present a unified mobile-edge AIGX framework, which employs edge devices to provide PFM-empowered AIGX services and optimizes such services via prompt engineering. More importantly, we demonstrate that suboptimal prompts lead to poor generation quality, which adversely affects user satisfaction, edge network performance, and resource utilization. Accordingly, we conduct a case study, showcasing how to train an effective prompt optimizer using ChatGPT and investigating how much improvement is possible with prompt engineering in terms of user experience, quality of generation, and network performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figure |
| **[Read-only Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14960v2)** | 2023-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead.

However, many evaluation studies have found that their performance on medical imaging modalities to be underwhelming compared to conventional deep learning methods. In the world of large pre-trained language and vision-language models, learning prompt from downstream tasks has achieved considerable success in improving performance. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Prompt Optimization Technique for foundation models like SAM (SAMPOT) that utilizes the downstream segmentation task to optimize the human-provided prompt to obtain improved performance. We demonstrate the utility of SAMPOT on lung segmentation in chest X-ray images and obtain an improvement on a significant number of cases ($\sim75\%$) over human-provided initial prompts. We hope this work will lead to further investigations in the nascent field of automatic visual prompt-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This approach offers important advantages, such as generating interpretable prompts and being compatible with black-box foundation models. However, the substantial prompt space size poses challenges for RL-based methods, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper introduces MultiPrompter, a new framework that views prompt optimization as a cooperative game between prompters which take turns composing a prompt together. Our cooperative prompt optimization effectively reduces the problem size and helps prompters learn optimal prompts. We test our method on the text-to-image task and show its ability to generate higher-quality images than baselines.</p></details> |  |

We use machine-generated prompts to probe how models respond to input that is not composed of natural language expressions. We study the behavior of models of different sizes in multiple semantic tasks in response to both continuous and discrete machine-generated prompts, and compare it to the behavior in response to human-generated natural-language prompts. Even when producing a similar output, machine-generated and human prompts trigger different response patterns through the network processing pathways, including different perplexities, different attention and output entropy distributions, and different unit activation profiles. We provide preliminary insight into the nature of the units activated by different prompt types, suggesting that only natural language prompts recruit a genuinely linguistic circuit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2023 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

We provide empirical evidence that state-of-the-art LLMs suffer from poor generalizability on reasoning types beyond those seen in the prompt. To remedy this, we propose a Mixture-of-Reasoning-Experts (MoRE) framework that ensembles diverse specialized language models. We specialize the backbone language model with prompts optimized for different reasoning categories, including factual, multihop, mathematical, and commonsense reasoning. Our key insight is to leverage agreement among the specialized experts to select the best answer for each question, or to abstain from answering. This gives MoRE higher accuracy than any single specialized model on a collection of 12 QA datasets from four reasoning types. Beyond generalizability, the interpretable design of MoRE improves selective question answering results compared to baselines without incorporating inter-expert agreement. This framework is also more interpretable and useful to human consumers of QA outputs. Our human study confirms that presenting expert predictions and the answer selection process helps annotators more accurately calibrate when to trust the system's output. We release all code and data to facilitate future work.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Findings |

We propose a simple and nonparametric solution to this problem, Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which is inspired by numerical gradient descent to automatically improve prompts, assuming access to training data and an LLM API. The algorithm uses minibatches of data to form natural language "gradients" that criticize the current prompt. The gradients are then "propagated" into the prompt by editing the prompt in the opposite semantic direction of the gradient. These gradient descent steps are guided by a beam search and bandit selection procedure which significantly improves algorithmic efficiency. Preliminary results across three benchmark NLP tasks and the novel problem of LLM jailbreak detection suggest that Automatic Prompt Optimization can outperform prior prompt editing techniques and improve an initial prompt's performance by up to 31%, by using data to rewrite vague task descriptions into more precise annotation instructions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 |

Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models are put forward to avoid data collection, but they are also limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing.

In this paper, we propose MLLM-DataEngine, a novel closed-loop system that bridges data generation, model training, and evaluation. Within each loop iteration, the MLLM-DataEngine first analyze the weakness of the model based on the evaluation results, then generate a proper incremental dataset for the next training iteration and enhance the model capability iteratively. Compared with previous data collection methods which are separate from the benchmarking, the data generated by MLLM-DataEngine shows better targeting, quality, and correctness. For targeting, we propose an Adaptive Bad-case Sampling module, which adjusts the ratio of different types of data within each incremental dataset based on the benchmarking results. For quality, we resort to GPT-4 to generate high-quality data with each given data type. For correctness, prompt design is critical for the data generation results. Rather than previous hand-crafted prompt, we propose an Interactive Prompt Optimization strategy, which optimizes the prompt with the multi-round interaction between human and GPT, and improve the correctness of generated data greatly. Through extensive experiments, we find our MLLM-DataEngine could boost the MLLM capability in a targeted and automatic manner, with only a few human participation. We hope it could be a general solution for the following MLLMs building.

First, there is no convenient interface for domain experts to provide domain knowledge easily. Second, they require significant training data collection overheads. Third, the accuracy suffers from complicated schema changes. To bridge this gap, we present a novel approach that leverages the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in coding, complex reasoning, and zero-shot learning to generate SQL code that transforms the source datasets into the target datasets. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by designing an LLM-based framework, termed SQLMorpher, which comprises a prompt generator that integrates the initial prompt with optional domain knowledge and historical patterns in external databases. It also implements an iterative prompt optimization mechanism that automatically improves the prompt based on flaw detection. The key contributions of this work include (1) pioneering an end-to-end LLM-based solution for data transformation, (2) developing a benchmark dataset of 105 real-world building energy data transformation problems, and (3) conducting an extensive empirical evaluation where our approach achieved 96% accuracy in all 105 problems. SQLMorpher demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs in complex, domain-specific challenges, highlighting the potential of their potential to drive sustainable solutions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Both are unlikely to lead to good results without a substantial amount of data and computational resources. Prompt learning without changing the parameters of a large language model presents a promising alternative. It is a cost-effective approach, while still achieving competitive results. While this procedure is now established for zero- and few-shot text classification and structured prediction, it has received limited attention in conditional text generation. We present the first automatic prompt optimization approach for emotion-conditioned text generation with instruction-fine-tuned models. Our method uses an iterative optimization procedure that changes the prompt by adding, removing, or replacing tokens. As objective function, we only require a text classifier that measures the realization of the conditional variable in the generated text. We evaluate the method on emotion-conditioned text generation with a focus on event reports and compare it to manually designed prompts that also act as the seed for the optimization procedure. The optimized prompts achieve 0.75 macro-average F1 to fulfill the emotion condition in contrast to manually designed seed prompts with only 0.22 macro-average F1.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable ability in achieving high-quality annotation in various tasks, the key to applying this ability to specific tasks lies in developing high-quality prompts. Thus we propose a framework to inherit the merits of both in-context learning and zero-shot learning by incorporating enriched instructions derived from input-output demonstrations to optimize original prompt. We refer to the enrichment as the hint and propose a framework to automatically generate the hint from labeled data. More concretely, starting from an initial prompt, our method first instructs a LLM to deduce new hints for selected samples from incorrect predictions, and then summarizes from per-sample hints and adds the results back to the initial prompt to form a new, enriched instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on the BIG-Bench Instruction Induction dataset for both zero-shot and few-short prompts, where experiments demonstrate our method is able to significantly boost accuracy for multiple tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023: Foundations and Applications in Large-scale AI Models-Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompt-based Learning workshop</p></details> |

Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities becomes important in addressing this issue. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on having access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose \emph{knowledge-informed prompts}, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we design a Monte Carlo dropout based prompt optimization method to further to improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12\%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.</p></details> |  |

Often these models can be prompted with multi-modal inputs that range from natural language descriptions over images to point clouds. In this paper, we propose topological data analysis (TDA) guided prompt optimization for the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and show preliminary results in the biological image segmentation domain. Our approach replaces the standard grid search approach that is used in the original implementation and finds point locations based on their topological significance. Our results show that the TDA optimized point cloud is much better suited for finding small objects and massively reduces computational complexity despite the extra step in scenarios which require many segmentations.</p></details> |  |

Owing to the intrinsic complexity of medical images and the high annotation cost, the medical image segmentation (MIS) community has been encouraged to investigate SAM's zero-shot capabilities to facilitate automatic annotation. Inspired by the extraordinary accomplishments of interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) paradigm, this paper focuses on assessing the potential of SAM's zero-shot capabilities within the IMIS paradigm to amplify its benefits in the MIS domain. Regrettably, we observe that SAM's vulnerability to prompt forms (e.g., points, bounding boxes) becomes notably pronounced in IMIS. This leads us to develop a framework that adaptively offers suitable prompt forms for human experts. We refer to the framework above as temporally-extended prompts optimization (TEPO) and model it as a Markov decision process, solvable through reinforcement learning. Numerical experiments on the standardized benchmark BraTS2020 demonstrate that the learned TEPO agent can further enhance SAM's zero-shot capability in the MIS context.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Here, we propose a novel Zero-shot segmentation with Optimal Transport (ZegOT) method that matches multiple text prompts with frozen image embeddings through optimal transport. In particular, we introduce a novel Multiple Prompt Optimal Transport Solver (MPOT), which is designed to learn an optimal mapping between multiple text prompts and visual feature maps of the frozen image encoder hidden layers. This unique mapping method facilitates each of the multiple text prompts to effectively focus on distinct visual semantic attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over existing Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) approaches.</p></details> | 18pages, 8 figures |
