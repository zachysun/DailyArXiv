| **[Evaluating Time-Dependent Methods and Seasonal Effects in Code Technical Debt Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08095v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Technical Debt prediction has become a popular research niche in recent software engineering literature. Technical Debt is an important metric in software projects as it measures professionals' effort to clean the code. Therefore, predicting its future behavior becomes a crucial task. However, no well-defined and consistent approach can completely capture the features that impact the evolution of Code Technical Debt. The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of considering time-dependent techniques as well as seasonal effects in temporal data in the prediction performance within the context of Code Technical Debt. The study adopts existing, yet not extensively adopted, time-dependent prediction techniques and compares their prediction performance to commonly used Machine Learning models. Further, the study strengthens the evaluation of time-dependent methods by extending the analysis to capture the impact of seasonality in Code Technical Debt data. We trained 11 prediction models using the commit history of 31 open-source projects developed with Java. We predicted the future observations of the SQALE index to evaluate their predictive performance. Our study confirms the positive impact of considering time-dependent techniques. The adopted multivariate time series analysis model ARIMAX overcame the rest of the adopted models. Incorporating seasonal effects led to an enhancement in the predictive performance of the adopted time-dependent techniques. However, the impact of this effect was found to be relatively modest. The findings of this study corroborate our position in favor of implementing techniques that capture the existing time dependence within historical data of software metrics, specifically in the context of this study, namely, Code Technical Debt. This necessitates the utilization of techniques that can effectively address this evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universality of Real Minimal Complexity Reservoir](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08071v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir Computing (RC) models, a subclass of recurrent neural networks, are distinguished by their fixed, non-trainable input layer and dynamically coupled reservoir, with only the static readout layer being trained. This design circumvents the issues associated with backpropagating error signals through time, thereby enhancing both stability and training efficiency. RC models have been successfully applied across a broad range of application domains. Crucially, they have been demonstrated to be universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory, under various settings of approximation norms and input driving sources. Simple Cycle Reservoirs (SCR) represent a specialized class of RC models with a highly constrained reservoir architecture, characterized by uniform ring connectivity and binary input-to-reservoir weights with an aperiodic sign pattern. For linear reservoirs, given the reservoir size, the reservoir construction has only one degree of freedom -- the reservoir cycle weight. Such architectures are particularly amenable to hardware implementations without significant performance degradation in many practical tasks. In this study we endow these observations with solid theoretical foundations by proving that SCRs operating in real domain are universal approximators of time-invariant dynamic filters with fading memory. Our results supplement recent research showing that SCRs in the complex domain can approximate, to arbitrary precision, any unrestricted linear reservoir with a non-linear readout. We furthermore introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the number of SCR units, making such highly constrained architectures natural candidates for low-complexity hardware implementations. Our findings are supported by empirical studies on real-world time series datasets.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepClair: Utilizing Market Forecasts for Effective Portfolio Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13427v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing market forecasts is pivotal in optimizing portfolio selection strategies. We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</p></details> | CIKM 2024 Accepted |
| **[Causal Discovery from Time-Series Data with Short-Term Invariance-Based Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08023v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery from time-series data aims to capture both intra-slice (contemporaneous) and inter-slice (time-lagged) causality between variables within the temporal chain, which is crucial for various scientific disciplines. Compared to causal discovery from non-time-series data, causal discovery from time-series data necessitates more serialized samples with a larger amount of observed time steps. To address the challenges, we propose a novel gradient-based causal discovery approach STIC, which focuses on \textbf{S}hort-\textbf{T}erm \textbf{I}nvariance using \textbf{C}onvolutional neural networks to uncover the causal relationships from time-series data. Specifically, STIC leverages both the short-term time and mechanism invariance of causality within each window observation, which possesses the property of independence, to enhance sample efficiency. Furthermore, we construct two causal convolution kernels, which correspond to the short-term time and mechanism invariance respectively, to estimate the window causal graph. To demonstrate the necessity of convolutional neural networks for causal discovery from time-series data, we theoretically derive the equivalence between convolution and the underlying generative principle of time-series data under the assumption that the additive noise model is identifiable. Experimental evaluations conducted on both synthetic and FMRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STIC outperforms baselines significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, particularly when the datasets contain a limited number of observed time steps.

| **[RandomNet: Clustering Time Series Using Untrained Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07956v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are widely used in machine learning and data mining. Typically, these networks need to be trained, implying the adjustment of weights (parameters) within the network based on the input data. In this work, we propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural networks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random weights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles the clustering relationships derived from these different representations to build the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our model can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since all parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the process. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method. To validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128 datasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical analysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths, and they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Hedge Fund Portfolio Construction Using PolyModel Theory and iTransformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03320v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When constructing portfolios, a key problem is that a lot of financial time series data are sparse, making it challenging to apply machine learning methods. Polymodel theory can solve this issue and demonstrate superiority in portfolio construction from various aspects. To implement the PolyModel theory for constructing a hedge fund portfolio, we begin by identifying an asset pool, utilizing over 10,000 hedge funds for the past 29 years' data. PolyModel theory also involves choosing a wide-ranging set of risk factors, which includes various financial indices, currencies, and commodity prices. This comprehensive selection mirrors the complexities of the real-world environment. Leveraging on the PolyModel theory, we create quantitative measures such as Long-term Alpha, Long-term Ratio, and SVaR. We also use more classical measures like the Sharpe ratio or Morningstar's MRAR. To enhance the performance of the constructed portfolio, we also employ the latest deep learning techniques (iTransformer) to capture the upward trend, while efficiently controlling the downside, using all the features. The iTransformer model is specifically designed to address the challenges in high-dimensional time series forecasting and could largely improve our strategies. More precisely, our strategies achieve better Sharpe ratio and annualized return. The above process enables us to create multiple portfolio strategies aiming for high returns and low risks when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

| **[Incremental Structure Discovery of Classification via Sequential Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07875v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for making predictions and understanding uncertainty for classification with kernels and Bayesian non-parametric learning. Building such models typically requires strong prior knowledge to define preselect kernels, which could be ineffective for online applications of classification that sequentially process data because features of data may shift during the process. To alleviate the requirement of prior knowledge used in GPs and learn new features from data that arrive successively, this paper presents a novel method to automatically discover models of classification on complex data with little prior knowledge. Our method adapts a recently proposed technique for GP-based time-series structure discovery, which integrates GPs and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We extend the technique to handle extra latent variables in GP classification, such that our method can effectively and adaptively learn a-priori unknown structures of classification from continuous input. In addition, our method adapts new batch of data with updated structures of models. Our experiments show that our method is able to automatically incorporate various features of kernels on synthesized data and real-world data for classification. In the experiments of real-world data, our method outperforms various classification methods on both online and offline setting achieving a 10\% accuracy improvement on one benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Evaluation of Generated Time Series and Their Effects in Self-Supervised Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07869v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised Pretrained Models (PTMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. These successes have prompted researchers to design PTMs for time series data. In our experiments, most self-supervised time series PTMs were surpassed by simple supervised models. We hypothesize this undesired phenomenon may be caused by data scarcity. In response, we test six time series generation methods, use the generated data in pretraining in lieu of the real data, and examine the effects on classification performance. Our results indicate that replacing a real-data pretraining set with a greater volume of only generated samples produces noticeable improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CIKM 2024 as a short paper; the version here is the self-contained version that includes the non-mandatory supplementary material available on the paper's companion website</p></details> |
| **[MedTsLLM: Leveraging LLMs for Multimodal Medical Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07773v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity and heterogeneity of data in many real-world applications pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning and signal processing techniques. For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, MLHC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Local Cold Load Pick-up Estimation Using Customer Energy Consumption Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07754v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermostatically-controlled loads have a significant impact on electricity demand after service is restored following an outage, a phenomenon known as cold load pick-up (CLPU). Active management of CLPU is becoming an essential tool for distribution system operators who seek to defer network upgrades and speed up post-outage customer restoration. One key functionality needed for actively managing CLPU is its forecast at various scales. The widespread deployment of smart metering devices is also opening up new opportunities for data-driven load modeling and forecast. In this paper, we propose an approach for customer-side estimation of CLPU using time-stamped local load measurements. The proposed method uses Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling for short-term foregone energy consumption forecast during an outage. Forecasts are made on an hourly basis to estimate the energy to potentially recover after outages lasting up to several hours. Moreover, to account for changing customer behavior and weather, the model order is adjusted dynamically. Simulation results based on actual smart meter measurements are presented for 50 residential customers over the duration of one year. These results are validated using physical modeling of residential loads and are shown to match well the ARIMA-based forecasts. Additionally, accuracy and execution speed has been compared with other state-of-the-art approaches for time-series forecasting including Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES). ARIMA-based forecast is found to offer superior performance both in terms of accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Predictions in Unmonitored Sites: A Survey of Machine Learning Techniques in Water Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09766v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prediction of dynamic environmental variables in unmonitored sites remains a long-standing challenge for water resources science. The majority of the world's freshwater resources have inadequate monitoring of critical environmental variables needed for management. Yet, the need to have widespread predictions of hydrological variables such as river flow and water quality has become increasingly urgent due to climate and land use change over the past decades, and their associated impacts on water resources. Modern machine learning methods increasingly outperform their process-based and empirical model counterparts for hydrologic time series prediction with their ability to extract information from large, diverse data sets. We review relevant state-of-the art applications of machine learning for streamflow, water quality, and other water resources prediction and discuss opportunities to improve the use of machine learning with emerging methods for incorporating watershed characteristics into deep learning models, transfer learning, and incorporating process knowledge into machine learning models. The analysis here suggests most prior efforts have been focused on deep learning learning frameworks built on many sites for predictions at daily time scales in the United States, but that comparisons between different classes of machine learning methods are few and inadequate. We identify several open questions for time series predictions in unmonitored sites that include incorporating dynamic inputs and site characteristics, mechanistic understanding and spatial context, and explainable AI techniques in modern machine learning frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Accepted to Environmental Data Science</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field. The code for our framework is accessible at https://github.com/IkeYang/ViTime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01138v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for Time Series Classification and Robust Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07314v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) has recently attracted significant attention as a promising alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figs |
| **[LiPCoT: Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for Self-supervised Learning of Time Series Data via Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07292v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks. However, their application to time series data, a crucial component in many domains, remains limited. This paper proposes LiPCoT (Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series), a novel tokenizer that encodes time series data into a sequence of tokens, enabling self-supervised learning of time series using existing Language model architectures such as BERT. Unlike traditional time series tokenizers that rely heavily on CNN encoder for time series feature generation, LiPCoT employs stochastic modeling through linear predictive coding to create a latent space for time series providing a compact yet rich representation of the inherent stochastic nature of the data. Furthermore, LiPCoT is computationally efficient and can effectively handle time series data with varying sampling rates and lengths, overcoming common limitations of existing time series tokenizers. In this proof-of-concept work, we present the effectiveness of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using an EEG dataset from 46 participants. In particular, we utilize LiPCoT to encode EEG data into a small vocabulary of tokens and then use BERT for self-supervised learning and the downstream task of PD classification. We benchmark our approach against several state-of-the-art CNN-based deep learning architectures for PD detection. Our results reveal that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning outperformed the best-performing existing method by 7.1% in precision, 2.3% in recall, 5.5% in accuracy, 4% in AUC, and 5% in F1-score highlighting the potential for self-supervised learning even on small datasets. Our work will inform future foundational models for time series, particularly for self-supervised learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry.

Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions in GIS</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation (AF), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of AF, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG within the MIMIC Perform AF dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for AF screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Leveraging Priors via Diffusion Bridge for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06672v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis test techniques. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v6)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

Despite the reported improvements in several papers, the practical application of these models remains limited. Recent studies have cast doubt on these models, attributing their results to flawed evaluation techniques. However, the impact of initialization has largely been overlooked. This paper provides a critical analysis of the initialization effects on TSAD model performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that TSAD models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as window size, seed number, and normalization. This sensitivity often leads to significant variability in performance, which can be exploited to artificially inflate the reported efficacy of these models. We demonstrate that even minor changes in initialization parameters can result in performance variations that overshadow the claimed improvements from novel model architectures. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation protocols and transparent reporting of preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability and fairness of anomaly detection methods. This paper calls for a more cautious interpretation of TSAD advancements and encourages the development of more robust and transparent evaluation practices to advance the field and its practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the inherent characteristic of time-series data containing both time and frequency features. In this work, we present Spectral eXplanation (SpectralX), an XAI framework that provides time-frequency explanations for time-series black-box classifiers. This easily adaptable framework enables users to "plug-in" various perturbation-based XAI methods for any pre-trained time-series classification models to assess their impact on the explanation quality without having to modify the framework architecture. Additionally, we introduce Feature Importance Approximations (FIA), a new perturbation-based XAI method. These methods consist of feature insertion, deletion, and combination techniques to enhance computational efficiency and class-specific explanations in time-series classification tasks. We conduct extensive experiments in the generated synthetic dataset and various UCR Time-Series datasets to first compare the explanation performance of FIA and other existing perturbation-based XAI methods in both time-domain and time-frequency domain, and then show the superiority of our FIA in the time-frequency domain with the SpectralX framework. Finally, we conduct a user study to confirm the practicality of our FIA in SpectralX framework for class-specific time-frequency based time-series explanations.

There are very few quantitative evaluation methodologies and even fewer examples of actionable explanation, where the explanation methods are shown to objectively improve specific computational tasks on time series data. In this paper we focus on analyzing InterpretTime, a recent evaluation methodology for attribution methods applied to MTSC. We showcase some significant weaknesses of the original methodology and propose ideas to improve both its accuracy and efficiency. Unlike related work, we go beyond evaluation and also showcase the actionability of the produced explainer ranking, by using the best attribution methods for the task of channel selection in MTSC. We find that perturbation-based methods such as SHAP and Feature Ablation work well across a set of datasets, classifiers and tasks and outperform gradient-based methods. We apply the best ranked explainers to channel selection for MTSC and show significant data size reduction and improved classifier accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Simulated data can be used in downstream tasks by augmenting datasets for signal searches, balancing data sets for machine learning, and validating detection schemes. In this work, we present Conditional Derivative GAN (cDVGAN), a novel conditional model in the Generative Adversarial Network framework for simulating multiple classes of time-domain observations that represent gravitational waves (GWs) and detector glitches. cDVGAN can also generate generalized hybrid samples that span the variation between classes through interpolation in the conditioned class vector. cDVGAN introduces an additional player into the typical 2-player adversarial game of GANs, where an auxiliary discriminator analyzes the first-order derivative time-series. Our results show that this provides synthetic data that better captures the features of the original data. cDVGAN conditions on three classes, two denoised from LIGO blip and tomte glitch events from its 3rd observing run (O3), and the third representing binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Our proposed cDVGAN outperforms 4 different baseline GAN models in replicating the features of the three classes. Specifically, our experiments show that training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with our cDVGAN-generated data improves the detection of samples embedded in detector noise beyond the synthetic data from other state-of-the-art GAN models. Our best synthetic dataset yields as much as a 4.2% increase in area-under-the-curve (AUC) performance compared to synthetic datasets from baseline GANs. Moreover, training the CNN with hybrid samples from our cDVGAN outperforms CNNs trained only on the standard classes, when identifying real samples embedded in LIGO detector background (4% AUC improvement for cDVGAN).</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2024 STRL Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |

Notwithstanding the relevance of this topic in numerous application fields, a comprehensive and extensive evaluation of recent state-of-the-art techniques taking into account real-world constraints is still needed. Some efforts have been made to compare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously. However, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and F1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their practical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (i) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (ii) the model size and the model stability are studied; (iii) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (iv) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |
| **[xLSTMTime : Long-term Time Series Forecasting With xLSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10240v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, transformer-based models have gained prominence in multivariate long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), demonstrating significant advancements despite facing challenges such as high computational demands, difficulty in capturing temporal dynamics, and managing long-term dependencies. The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07820v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023.

Current pre-training methods are limited in either unidirectional next-token prediction or randomly masked token prediction. We propose a novel architecture called Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (BiTimelyGPT), which pre-trains on biosignals and longitudinal clinical records by both next-token and previous-token prediction in alternating transformer layers. This pre-training task preserves original distribution and data shapes of the time-series. Additionally, the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices exhibit more expressive representation capabilities. Using biosignals and longitudinal clinical records, BiTimelyGPT demonstrates superior performance in predicting neurological functionality, disease diagnosis, and physiological signs. By visualizing the attention heatmap, we observe that the pre-trained BiTimelyGPT can identify discriminative segments from biosignal time-series sequences, even more so after fine-tuning on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk and cross validation in ridge regression with correlated samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04607v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen substantial advances in our understanding of high-dimensional ridge regression, but existing theories assume that training examples are independent. By leveraging recent techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 18 figures. v2: updated funding acknowledgements</p></details> |
| **[An End-to-End Model for Time Series Classification In the Presence of Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05849v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification with missing data is a prevalent issue in time series analysis, as temporal data often contain missing values in practical applications. The traditional two-stage approach, which handles imputation and classification separately, can result in sub-optimal performance as label information is not utilized in the imputation process. On the other hand, a one-stage approach can learn features under missing information, but feature representation is limited as imputed errors are propagated in the classification process. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end neural network that unifies data imputation and representation learning within a single framework, allowing the imputation process to take advantage of label information. Differing from previous methods, our approach places less emphasis on the accuracy of imputation data and instead prioritizes classification performance. A specifically designed multi-scale feature learning module is implemented to extract useful information from the noise-imputation data. The proposed model is evaluated on 68 univariate time series datasets from the UCR archive, as well as a multivariate time series dataset with various missing data ratios and 4 real-world datasets with missing information. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for incomplete time series classification, particularly in scenarios with high levels of missing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning of Nonlinear Independent Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05788v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the causal relations between interested variables plays a pivotal role in representation learning as it provides deep insights into the dataset. Identifiability, as the central theme of this approach, normally hinges on leveraging data from multiple distributions (intervention, distribution shift, time series, etc.). Despite the exciting development in this field, a practical but often overlooked problem is: what if those distribution shifts happen sequentially? In contrast, any intelligence possesses the capacity to abstract and refine learned knowledge sequentially -- lifelong learning. In this paper, with a particular focus on the nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) framework, we move one step forward toward the question of enabling models to learn meaningful (identifiable) representations in a sequential manner, termed continual causal representation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that model identifiability progresses from a subspace level to a component-wise level as the number of distributions increases. Empirically, we show that our method achieves performance comparable to nonlinear ICA methods trained jointly on multiple offline distributions and, surprisingly, the incoming new distribution does not necessarily benefit the identification of all latent variables.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

In conclusion, we found that NG-RC is more computationally efficient and offers greater potential for predicting chaotic system behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05052v3)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical functions of the latent causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects). For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the latent causal variables $Z_i$ and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series), without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases, most latent variables can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations. Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Dynamical causality under invisible confounders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05584v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causality inference is prone to spurious causal interactions, due to the substantial confounders in a complex system. While many existing methods based on the statistical methods or dynamical methods attempt to address misidentification challenges, there remains a notable lack of effective methods to infer causality, in particular in the presence of invisible/unobservable confounders. As a result, accurately inferring causation with invisible confounders remains a largely unexplored and outstanding issue in data science and AI fields. In this work, we propose a method to overcome such challenges to infer dynamical causality under invisible confounders (CIC method) and further reconstruct the invisible confounders from time-series data by developing an orthogonal decomposition theorem in a delay embedding space. The core of our CIC method lies in its ability to decompose the observed variables not in their original space but in their delay embedding space into the common and private subspaces respectively, thereby quantifying causality between those variables both theoretically and computationally. This theoretical foundation ensures the causal detection for any high-dimensional system even with only two observed variables under many invisible confounders, which is actually a long-standing problem in the field. In addition to the invisible confounder problem, such a decomposition actually makes the intertwined variables separable in the embedding space, thus also solving the non-separability problem of causal inference. Extensive validation of the CIC method is carried out using various real datasets, and the experimental results demonstrates its effectiveness to reconstruct real biological networks even with unobserved confounders.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Diffusion Model-based Contrastive Learning for Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05567v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based activity recognition has sparked numerous studies due to its widespread availability and privacy protection. However, when applied in practical applications, general CSI-based recognition models may face challenges related to the limited generalization capability, since individuals with different behavior habits will cause various fluctuations in CSI data and it is difficult to gather enough training data to cover all kinds of motion habits. To tackle this problem, we design a diffusion model-based Contrastive Learning framework for human Activity Recognition (CLAR) using WiFi CSI. On the basis of the contrastive learning framework, we primarily introduce two components for CLAR to enhance CSI-based activity recognition. To generate diverse augmented data and complement limited training data, we propose a diffusion model-based time series-specific augmentation model. In contrast to typical diffusion models that directly apply conditions to the generative process, potentially resulting in distorted CSI data, our tailored model dissects these condition into the high-frequency and low-frequency components, and then applies these conditions to the generative process with varying weights. This can alleviate data distortion and yield high-quality augmented data. To efficiently capture the difference of the sample importance, we present an adaptive weight algorithm. Different from typical contrastive learning methods which equally consider all the training samples, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights of positive sample pairs for learning better data representations. The experiments suggest that CLAR achieves significant gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

However, an analysis reveals certain unfaithfulness issues, including high sensitivity to random seeds, input and layer noise perturbations and parametric perturbations. Recognizing these challenges, we embark on a quest to define the concept of \textbf{\underline{F}aithful \underline{T}ime\underline{S}ieve \underline{(FTS)}}, a model that consistently delivers reliable and robust predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying and rectifying unfaithfulness in TimeSieve.

Experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating improved faithfulness in the model's behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTMixer: Frequency and Time Domain Representations Fusion for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15256v2)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data can be represented in both the time and frequency domains, with the time domain emphasizing local dependencies and the frequency domain highlighting global dependencies. To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is a significant gap in exploring the impact of food intake on physiological indicators (e.g., weight) over time. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the DietDiary dataset, which encompasses daily dietary diaries and corresponding weight measurements of real users. Furthermore, we propose a novel task of weight prediction with a dietary diary that aims to leverage historical food intake and weight to predict future weights. To tackle this task, we propose a model-agnostic time series forecasting framework. Specifically, we introduce a Unified Meal Representation Learning (UMRL) module to extract representations for each meal. Additionally, we design a diet-aware loss function to associate food intake with weight variations. By conducting experiments on the DietDiary dataset with two state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, NLinear and iTransformer, we demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves superior performance compared to the original models. We make our dataset, code, and models publicly available at: https://yxg1005.github.io/weight-prediction/.</p></details> | ACM MM'24 oral |
| **[Time Series Forecasting with LLMs: Understanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10835v3)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Masquerade Attacks in Controller Area Networks Using Graph Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05427v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles rely on a myriad of electronic control units (ECUs) interconnected via controller area networks (CANs) for critical operations. Despite their ubiquitous use and reliability, CANs are susceptible to sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly masquerade attacks, which inject false data that mimic legitimate messages at the expected frequency. These attacks pose severe risks such as unintended acceleration, brake deactivation, and rogue steering. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often struggle to detect these subtle intrusions due to their seamless integration into normal traffic. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting masquerade attacks in the CAN bus using graph machine learning (ML). We hypothesize that the integration of shallow graph embeddings with time series features derived from CAN frames enhances the detection of masquerade attacks. We show that by representing CAN bus frames as message sequence graphs (MSGs) and enriching each node with contextual statistical attributes from time series, we can enhance detection capabilities across various attack patterns compared to using only graph-based features. Our method ensures a comprehensive and dynamic analysis of CAN frame interactions, improving robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ROAD dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in the detection rates of masquerade attacks compared to a baseline that uses only graph-based features, as confirmed by Mann-Whitney U and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests (p < 0.05).</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-driven Java Performance Testing: Balancing Result Quality with Testing Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05100v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance testing aims at uncovering efficiency issues of software systems. In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '24)</p></details> |

Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting time series anomalies called Anomaly Prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |

These processes can greatly benefit from advances in the field, as state-of-the-art approaches may aid in cases involving, for example, highly dimensional data. To provide the reader with understanding of the terminology, this survey introduces a novel taxonomy where a distinction between online and offline, and training and inference is made. Additionally, it presents the most popular data sets and evaluation metrics used in the literature, as well as a detailed analysis. Furthermore, this survey provides an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art model-based online semi- and unsupervised anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time-series data, categorising them into different model families and other properties. The biggest research challenge revolves around benchmarking, as currently there is no reliable way to compare different approaches against one another. This problem is two-fold: on the one hand, public data sets suffers from at least one fundamental flaw, while on the other hand, there is a lack of intuitive and representative evaluation metrics in the field. Moreover, the way most publications choose a detection threshold disregards real-world conditions, which hinders the application in the real world. To allow for tangible advances in the field, these issues must be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |

Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. These approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and introduce mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables; Project page: https://github.com/KimMeen/Awesome-GNN4TS</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Neural Network for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19322v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce ProNet, an novel deep learning approach designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting, adaptively blending autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) strategies. Our method involves dividing the forecasting horizon into segments, predicting the most crucial steps in each segment non-autoregressively, and the remaining steps autoregressively. The segmentation process relies on latent variables, which effectively capture the significance of individual time steps through variational inference. In comparison to AR models, ProNet showcases remarkable advantages, requiring fewer AR iterations, resulting in faster prediction speed, and mitigating error accumulation. On the other hand, when compared to NAR models, ProNet takes into account the interdependency of predictions in the output space, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation, encompassing four large datasets, and an ablation study, demonstrate the effectiveness of ProNet, highlighting its superior performance in terms of accuracy and prediction speed, outperforming state-of-the-art AR and NAR forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.</p></details> |  |

Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can improve processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. They also preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays.

Convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are often used to this end as they are adept at handling data that are spatially distributed, including solutions to partial differential equations. When applied to unsteady physics problems, ROMs also require a model for time-series prediction of the low-dimensional latent variables. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network useful for modeling sequential data, are frequently employed in data-driven ROMs for autoregressive time-series prediction. When making predictions at unseen design points over long time horizons, error propagation is a frequently encountered issue, where errors made early on can compound over time and lead to large inaccuracies. In this work, we propose using bagging, a commonly used ensemble learning technique, to develop a fully data-driven ROM framework referred to as the CAE-eLSTM ROM that uses CAEs for spatial reconstruction of the full-order model and LSTM ensembles for time-series prediction. When applied to two unsteady fluid dynamics problems, our results show that the presented framework effectively reduces error propagation and leads to more accurate time-series prediction of latent variables at unseen points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated with revisions</p></details> |

DeepVATS is a tool that merges Deep Learning (Deep) with Visual Analytics (VA) for the analysis of large time series data (TS). It has three interconnected modules. The Deep Learning module, developed in R, manages the load of datasets and Deep Learning models from and to the Storage module. This module also supports models training and the acquisition of the embeddings from the latent space of the trained model. The Storage module operates using the Weights and Biases system. Subsequently, these embeddings can be analyzed in the Visual Analytics module. This module, based on an R Shiny application, allows the adjustment of the parameters related to the projection and clustering of the embeddings space. Once these parameters are set, interactive plots representing both the embeddings, and the time series are shown. This paper introduces the tool and examines its scalability through log analytics. The execution time evolution is examined while the length of the time series is varied. This is achieved by resampling a large data series into smaller subsets and logging the main execution and rendering times for later analysis of scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Admit...</summary><p>Admitted pending publication in Lecture Notes in Network and Systems (LNNS) series (Springer).

Besides traditional statistical models, modern forecasting techniques based on machine learning can be employed when treating volatility as a univariate, daily time-series. Moreover, econometric studies have shown that increasing the number of daily observations with high-frequency intraday data helps to improve volatility predictions. In this work, we propose DeepVol, a model based on Dilated Causal Convolutions that uses high-frequency data to forecast day-ahead volatility. Our empirical findings demonstrate that dilated convolutional filters are highly effective at extracting relevant information from intraday financial time-series, proving that this architecture can effectively leverage predictive information present in high-frequency data that would otherwise be lost if realised measures were precomputed. Simultaneously, dilated convolutional filters trained with intraday high-frequency data help us avoid the limitations of models that use daily data, such as model misspecification or manually designed handcrafted features, whose devise involves optimising the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency and makes models prone to lack of adaptation into changing circumstances. In our analysis, we use two years of intraday data from NASDAQ-100 to evaluate the performance of DeepVol. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed deep learning-based approach effectively learns global features from high-frequency data, resulting in more accurate predictions compared to traditional methodologies and producing more accurate risk measures.</p></details> | Updated version |

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |

However, causal relationships are difficult to be fully observed in real-world complex settings, such as spatial-temporal data from deployed sensor networks. Therefore, to capture fine-grained causal relations among spatial-temporal variables for further a more accurate and reliable time series analysis, we first design a conceptual fine-grained causal model named TBN Granger Causality, which adds time-respecting Bayesian Networks to the previous time-lagged Neural Granger Causality to offset the instantaneous effects. Second, we propose an end-to-end deep generative model called TacSas, which discovers TBN Granger Causality in a generative manner to help forecast time series data and detect possible anomalies during the forecast. For evaluations, besides the causality discovery benchmark Lorenz-96, we also test TacSas on climate benchmark ERA5 for climate forecasting and the extreme weather benchmark of NOAA for extreme weather alerts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 AI for Science Workshop</p></details> |

For example, quantifying the risk of adverse outcomes after an acute cardiovascular event helps healthcare providers identify those patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes; i.e., patients who benefit from invasive therapies that can lower their risk. Assessing the risk of adverse outcomes, however, is challenging due to the complexity, variability, and heterogeneity of longitudinal medical data, especially for individuals suffering from chronic diseases like heart failure. In this paper, we introduce Event-Based Contrastive Learning (EBCL) - a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events. We demonstrate that EBCL can be used to construct models that yield improved performance on important downstream tasks relative to other pretraining methods. We develop and test the method using a cohort of heart failure patients obtained from a large hospital network and the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset consisting of patients in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care center. On both cohorts, EBCL pretraining yields models that are performant with respect to a number of downstream tasks, including mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay. In addition, unsupervised EBCL embeddings effectively cluster heart failure patients into subgroups with distinct outcomes, thereby providing information that helps identify new heart failure phenotypes. The contrastive framework around the index event can be adapted to a wide array of time-series datasets and provides information that can be used to guide personalized care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Unifying Representations in Neural Models Workshop in NeurIPS 2023, MLHC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Transformer for High Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04245v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic. The source code and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cluster-Wide Task Slowdown Detection in Cloud System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04236v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slow task detection is a critical problem in cloud operation and maintenance since it is highly related to user experience and can bring substantial liquidated damages. Most anomaly detection methods detect it from a single-task aspect. However, considering millions of concurrent tasks in large-scale cloud computing clusters, it becomes impractical and inefficient. Moreover, single-task slowdowns are very common and do not necessarily indicate a malfunction of a cluster due to its violent fluctuation nature in a virtual environment. Thus, we shift our attention to cluster-wide task slowdowns by utilizing the duration time distribution of tasks across a cluster, so that the computation complexity is not relevant to the number of tasks. The task duration time distribution often exhibits compound periodicity and local exceptional fluctuations over time. Though transformer-based methods are one of the most powerful methods to capture these time series normal variation patterns, we empirically find and theoretically explain the flaw of the standard attention mechanism in reconstructing subperiods with low amplitude when dealing with compound periodicity. To tackle these challenges, we propose SORN (i.e., Skimming Off subperiods in descending amplitude order and Reconstructing Non-slowing fluctuation), which consists of a Skimming Attention mechanism to reconstruct the compound periodicity and a Neural Optimal Transport module to distinguish cluster-wide slowdowns from other exceptional fluctuations. Furthermore, since anomalies in the training set are inevitable in a practical scenario, we propose a picky loss function, which adaptively assigns higher weights to reliable time slots in the training set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SORN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world industrial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by KDD2024</p></details> |

By comparing it with several common machine learning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad click prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which is an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other three base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is more capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series patterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of the traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its effectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically changing user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate predictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model, this study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and the test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two datasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the model has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Crime Prediction With Spatial Temporal Multivariate Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04193v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARLA: Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09296v4)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is the lack of labelled data in many real-life scenarios. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time series in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly, resulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently leading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise normal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end self-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series Anomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume that augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant windows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as augmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a temporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive approach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and injects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not only learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies. It creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct ones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about representations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the performance of anomaly detection. In extensive tests on seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets, CARLA shows superior performance over state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised TSAD methods. Our research shows the potential of contrastive representation learning to advance time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 9 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Open-Set Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12294v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous methods for time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) have emerged in recent years, most of which are unsupervised and assume that only normal samples are available during the training phase, due to the challenge of obtaining abnormal data in real-world scenarios. Still, limited samples of abnormal data are often available, albeit they are far from representative of all possible anomalies. Supervised methods can be utilized to classify normal and seen anomalies, but they tend to overfit to the seen anomalies present during training, hence, they fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. We propose the first algorithm to address the open-set TSAD problem, called Multivariate Open-Set Time-Series Anomaly Detector (MOSAD), that leverages only a few shots of labeled anomalies during the training phase in order to achieve superior anomaly detection performance compared to both supervised and unsupervised TSAD algorithms. MOSAD is a novel multi-head TSAD framework with a shared representation space and specialized heads, including the Generative head, the Discriminative head, and the Anomaly-Aware Contrastive head. The latter produces a superior representation space for anomaly detection compared to conventional supervised contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets establish MOSAD as a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECAI-2024</p></details> |

Recently, Transformer neural network architectures have shown promising results in forecasting on common time series benchmark datasets. However, application to supply chain demand forecasting, which can have challenging characteristics such as sparsity and cross-series effects, has been limited. In this work, we explore the application of Transformer-based models to supply chain demand forecasting. In particular, we develop a new Transformer-based forecasting approach using a shared, multi-task per-time series network with an initial component applying attention across time series, to capture interactions and help address sparsity. We provide a case study applying our approach to successfully improve demand prediction for a medical device manufacturing company. To further validate our approach, we also apply it to public demand forecasting datasets as well and demonstrate competitive to superior performance compared to a variety of baseline and state-of-the-art forecast methods across the private and public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Prediction of Causes (not Effects) in Healthcare by Long-Term Clinical Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03816v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning for early syndrome diagnosis aims to solve the intricate task of predicting a ground truth label that most often is the outcome (effect) of a medical consensus definition applied to observed clinical measurements (causes), given clinical measurements observed several hours before. Instead of focusing on the prediction of the future effect, we propose to directly predict the causes via time series forecasting (TSF) of clinical variables and determine the effect by applying the gold standard consensus definition to the forecasted values. This method has the invaluable advantage of being straightforwardly interpretable to clinical practitioners, and because model training does not rely on a particular label anymore, the forecasted data can be used to predict any consensus-based label. We exemplify our method by means of long-term TSF with Transformer models, with a focus on accurate prediction of sparse clinical variables involved in the SOFA-based Sepsis-3 definition and the new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) definition. Our experiments are conducted on two datasets and show that contrary to recent proposals which advocate set function encoders for time series and direct multi-step decoders, best results are achieved by a combination of standard dense encoders with iterative multi-step decoders. The key for success of iterative multi-step decoding can be attributed to its ability to capture cross-variate dependencies and to a student forcing training strategy that teaches the model to rely on its own previous time step predictions for the next time step prediction.</p></details> |  |

This design enables AI to learn from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely, becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second, safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors. We also analyze potential mitigation measures and advocate for community awareness regarding the safety of embodied AI applications in the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version (17 pages, 4 figures).

However, concerns regarding cost, network limitations, and security constraints have posed challenges for their integration into work processes. In this study, we adopt a systems design approach to employing LLMs as imperfect data annotators for downstream supervised learning tasks, introducing novel system intervention measures aimed at improving classification performance. Our methodology outperforms LLM-generated labels in seven of eight tests, demonstrating an effective strategy for incorporating LLMs into the design and deployment of specialized, supervised learning models present in many industry use cases.</p></details> |  |

While the draft head in speculative decoding mitigates this issue, its full potential remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce KOALA (K-layer Optimized Adversarial Learning Architecture), an orthogonal approach to the draft head. By transforming the conventional single-layer draft head into a multi-layer architecture and incorporating adversarial learning into the traditional supervised training, KOALA significantly improves the accuracy of the draft head in predicting subsequent tokens, thus more closely mirroring the functionality of LLMs. Although this improvement comes at the cost of slightly increased drafting overhead, KOALA substantially unlocks the draft head's potential, greatly enhancing speculative decoding. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of KOALA, including both autoregressive and non-autoregressive draft heads across various tasks, demonstrating a latency speedup ratio improvement of 0.24x-0.41x, which is 10.57%-14.09% faster than the original draft heads.</p></details> |  |
| **[I-SHEEP: Self-Alignment of LLM from Scratch through an Iterative Self-Enhancement Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08072v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, however, the common learning paradigm treats LLMs as passive information repositories, neglecting their potential for active learning and alignment. Some approaches train LLMs using their own generated synthetic data, exploring the possibility of active alignment. However, there is still a huge gap between these one-time alignment methods and the continuous automatic alignment of humans. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{I-SHEEP}, an \textbf{I}terative \textbf{S}elf-En\textbf{H}anc\textbf{E}m\textbf{E}nt \textbf{P}aradigm.This human-like paradigm enables LLMs to \textbf{continuously self-align from scratch with nothing}. Compared to the one-time alignment method Dromedary \cite{sun2023principledriven}, which refers to the first iteration in this paper, I-SHEEP can significantly enhance capacities on both Qwen and Llama models. I-SHEEP achieves a maximum relative improvement of 78.2\% in the Alpaca Eval, 24.0\% in the MT Bench, and an absolute increase of 8.88\% in the IFEval accuracy over subsequent iterations in Qwen-1.5 72B model. Additionally, I-SHEEP surpasses the base model in various standard benchmark generation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 24.77\% in code generation tasks, 12.04\% in TrivialQA, and 20.29\% in SQuAD. We also provide new insights based on the experiment results. Our codes, datasets, and models are available at \textbf{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SHEEP}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Sentinel: LLM Agent for Adversarial Purification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20770v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past two years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has advanced rapidly. While these LLMs offer considerable convenience, they also raise security concerns, as LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks by some well-designed textual perturbations. In this paper, we introduce a novel defense technique named Large LAnguage MOdel Sentinel (LLAMOS), which is designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of LLMs by purifying the adversarial textual examples before feeding them into the target LLM. Our method comprises two main components: a) Agent instruction, which can simulate a new agent for adversarial defense, altering minimal characters to maintain the original meaning of the sentence while defending against attacks; b) Defense guidance, which provides strategies for modifying clean or adversarial examples to ensure effective defense and accurate outputs from the target LLMs. Remarkably, the defense agent demonstrates robust defensive capabilities even without learning from adversarial examples. Additionally, we conduct an intriguing adversarial experiment where we develop two agents, one for defense and one for attack, and engage them in mutual confrontation. During the adversarial interactions, neither agent completely beat the other. Extensive experiments on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively defends against adversarial attacks, thereby enhancing adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear. In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p></details> |  |

However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback.

The Case of Language-based Persuasion Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17435v4)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.</p></details> |  |

For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, MLHC 2024</p></details> |

This work accompanies the first-ever release of a LLM-generated, MBR-decoded and QE-reranked dataset with both sentence-level and multi-sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine-generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web-crawled) WMT'23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger), and also outperforms training on the top-quality subset of the WMT'23 training dataset. We also find that performing self-distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLM's strong few-shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset, and demonstrate the value of high-quality machine-generated data in improving performance of NMT models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Persona Inconstancy in Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration: Conformity, Confabulation, and Impersonation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03862v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent AI systems can be used for simulating collective decision-making in scientific and practical applications. They can also be used to introduce a diverse group discussion step in chatbot pipelines, enhancing the cultural sensitivity of the chatbot's responses. These applications, however, are predicated on the ability of AI agents to reliably adopt assigned personas and mimic human interactions. To see whether LLM agents satisfy these requirements, we examine AI agent ensembles engaged in cross-national collaboration and debate by analyzing their private responses and chat transcripts. Our findings suggest that multi-agent discussions can support collective AI decisions that more often reflect diverse perspectives, yet this effect is tempered by the agents' susceptibility to conformity due to perceived peer pressure and occasional challenges in maintaining consistent personas and opinions. Instructions that encourage debate in support of one's opinions rather than collaboration increase the rate of inconstancy. Without addressing the factors we identify, the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for producing more culturally diverse AI outputs or more realistic simulations of group decision-making may remain untapped.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Exploring LLM Multi-Agents for ICD Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15363v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding task, where they often produce inaccurate and incomplete prediction results due to the high-dimensional and skewed distribution of the ICD codes, and often lack interpretability and reliability as well. We introduce an innovative multi-agent approach for ICD coding which mimics the ICD coding assignment procedure in real-world settings, comprising five distinct agents: the patient, physician, coder, reviewer, and adjuster. Each agent utilizes an LLM-based model tailored to their specific role within the coding process. We also integrate the system with Electronic Health Record (HER)'s SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment and plan) structure to boost the performances. We compare our method with a system of agents designed solely by LLMs and other strong baselines and evaluate it using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset. Our multi-agent coding framework significantly outperforms Zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting and self-consistency with CoT (CoT-SC) in coding common and rare ICD codes. An ablation study validates the effectiveness of the designated agent roles. it also outperforms the LLM-designed agent system. Moreover, our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art ICD coding methods that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, and outperforms them in rare code accuracy, and explainability. Additionally, we demonstrate the method's practical applicability by presenting its performance in scenarios not limited by the common or rare ICD code constraints.The proposed multi-agent method for ICD coding effectively mimics the real-world coding process and improves performance on both common and rare codes.</p></details> | 12pages |

Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES)</p></details> |

Watermarking methods, particularly logit-based approaches, embed imperceptible identifiers into text to address these challenges. However, the widespread usage of watermarking across diverse LLMs has led to an inevitable issue known as watermark collision during common tasks, such as paraphrasing or translation. In this paper, we introduce watermark collision as a novel and general philosophy for watermark attacks, aimed at enhancing attack performance on top of any other attacking methods. We also provide a comprehensive demonstration that watermark collision poses a threat to all logit-based watermark algorithms, impacting not only specific attack scenarios but also downstream applications.</p></details> | Long Paper, 7 pages |

Inspired by the rise of large language models (LLMs) in various AI applications, there is a surge of work on LLM-based SRS. Despite their attractive performance, existing LLM-based SRS still exhibit some limitations, including neglecting intra-item relations, ignoring long-term collaborative knowledge and using inflexible architecture designs for adaption. To alleviate these issues, we propose an LLM-based SRS named MixRec. Built on top of coarse-grained adaption for capturing inter-item relations, MixRec is further enhanced with (1) context masking that models intra-item relations to help LLM better understand token and item semantics in the context of SRS, (2) collaborative knowledge injection that helps LLM incorporate long-term collaborative knowledge, and (3) a dynamic adaptive mixture-of-experts design that can flexibly choose expert architectures based on Bayesian optimization to better incorporate different sequential information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixRec can effectively handle sequential recommendation in a dynamic and adaptive manner.</p></details> | 11 pages, 14 figures |

To address these issues, we introduce BioRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Large Language Models (LLMs) framework. Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge, followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain. Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step reasoning. Rigorous experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms fine-tuned LLM, LLM with search engines, and other scientific RAG frameworks across multiple life science question-answering tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This task is especially challenging because modern large language models (LLMs) produce disinformation with human-like quality. Additionally, the diversity in prompting methods used to generate disinformation complicates accurate source attribution. These methods introduce domain-specific features that can mask the fundamental characteristics of the models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of model attribution as a domain generalization problem, where each prompting method represents a unique domain. We argue that an effective attribution model must be invariant to these domain-specific features. It should also be proficient in identifying the originating models across all scenarios, reflecting real-world detection challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on Supervised Contrastive Learning. This method is designed to enhance the model's robustness to variations in prompts and focuses on distinguishing between different source LLMs. We evaluate our model through rigorous experiments involving three common prompting methods: ``open-ended'', ``rewriting'', and ``paraphrasing'', and three advanced LLMs: ``llama 2'', ``chatgpt'', and ``vicuna''. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in model attribution tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse and unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, accepted at DSAA 2024</p></details> |

However, the adoption of specific software versions in development projects may introduce security risks when these versions bring along vulnerabilities. Current methods of identifying vulnerable versions typically analyze and trace the code involved in vulnerability patches using static analysis with pre-defined rules. They then use syntactic-level code clone detection to identify the vulnerable versions. These methods are hindered by imprecisions due to (1) the inclusion of vulnerability-irrelevant code in the analysis and (2) the inadequacy of syntactic-level code clone detection. This paper presents Vercation, an approach designed to identify vulnerable versions of OSS written in C/C++. Vercation combines program slicing with a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify vulnerability-relevant code from vulnerability patches. It then backtraces historical commits to gather previous modifications of identified vulnerability-relevant code. We propose semantic-level code clone detection to compare the differences between pre-modification and post-modification code, thereby locating the vulnerability-introducing commit (vic) and enabling to identify the vulnerable versions between the patch commit and the vic. We curate a dataset linking 74 OSS vulnerabilities and 1013 versions to evaluate Vercation. On this dataset, our approach achieves the F1 score of 92.4%, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, Vercation detected 134 incorrect vulnerable OSS versions in NVD reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Advanced LLMs to Enhance Smaller LLMs: An Interpretable Knowledge Distillation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07238v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or LlaMa 3 provide superior performance in complex human-like interactions. But they are costly, or too large for edge devices such as smartphones and harder to self-host, leading to security and privacy concerns. This paper introduces a novel interpretable knowledge distillation approach to enhance the performance of smaller, more economical LLMs that firms can self-host. We study this problem in the context of building a customer service agent aimed at achieving high customer satisfaction through goal-oriented dialogues. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation, where the "student" model learns directly from the "teacher" model's responses via fine-tuning, our interpretable "strategy" teaching approach involves the teacher providing strategies to improve the student's performance in various scenarios. This method alternates between a "scenario generation" step and a "strategies for improvement" step, creating a customized library of scenarios and optimized strategies for automated prompting. The method requires only black-box access to both student and teacher models; hence it can be used without manipulating model parameters. In our customer service application, the method improves performance, and the learned strategies are transferable to other LLMs and scenarios beyond the training set. The method's interpretabilty helps safeguard against potential harms through human audit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03626v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate these problems, we propose {\bf ELLA}, a tool for {\bf E}mpowering {\bf L}LMs for interpretable, accurate, and informative {\bf L}egal {\bf A}dvice. ELLA visually presents the correlation between legal articles and LLM's response by calculating their similarities, providing users with an intuitive legal basis for the responses. Besides, based on the users' queries, ELLA retrieves relevant legal articles and displays them to users. Users can interactively select legal articles for LLM to generate more accurate responses. ELLA also retrieves relevant legal cases for user reference. Our user study shows that presenting the legal basis for the response helps users understand better. The accuracy of LLM's responses also improves when users intervene in selecting legal articles for LLM. Providing relevant legal cases also aids individuals in obtaining comprehensive information.</p></details> |  |

Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.

This challenge involves efficiently allocating jobs to a limited number of machines while minimizing factors like total processing time or job delays. While recent advancements in artificial intelligence have yielded promising solutions, such as reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, this paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for JSSP. We introduce the very first supervised 120k dataset specifically designed to train LLMs for JSSP. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that LLM-based scheduling can achieve performance comparable to other neural approaches. Furthermore, we propose a sampling method that enhances the effectiveness of LLMs in tackling JSSP.</p></details> |  |

Systematically analyzing their failures and effectively enhancing their performance remain significant challenges. This paper introduces the Re-TASK framework, a novel theoretical model that Revisits LLM Tasks from cApability, Skill, Knowledge perspectives, guided by the principles of Bloom's Taxonomy and Knowledge Space Theory. The Re-TASK framework provides a systematic methodology to deepen our understanding, evaluation, and enhancement of LLMs for domain-specific tasks. It explores the interplay among an LLM's capabilities, the knowledge it processes, and the skills it applies, elucidating how these elements are interconnected and impact task performance. Our application of the Re-TASK framework reveals that many failures in domain-specific tasks can be attributed to insufficient knowledge or inadequate skill adaptation. With this insight, we propose structured strategies for enhancing LLMs through targeted knowledge injection and skill adaptation. Specifically, we identify key capability items associated with tasks and employ a deliberately designed prompting strategy to enhance task performance, thereby reducing the need for extensive fine-tuning. Alternatively, we fine-tune the LLM using capability-specific instructions, further validating the efficacy of our framework. Experimental results confirm the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating substantial improvements in both the performance and applicability of LLMs.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

To address this issue, we propose SUBLLM, short for Subsampling-Upsampling-Bypass Large Language Model, an innovative architecture that extends the core decoder-only framework by incorporating subsampling, upsampling, and bypass modules. The subsampling modules are responsible for shortening the sequence, while the upsampling modules restore the sequence length, and the bypass modules enhance convergence. In comparison to LLaMA, the proposed SUBLLM exhibits significant enhancements in both training and inference speeds as well as memory usage, while maintaining competitive few-shot performance. During training, SUBLLM increases speeds by 26% and cuts memory by 10GB per GPU. In inference, it boosts speeds by up to 37% and reduces memory by 1GB per GPU. The training and inference speeds can be enhanced by 34% and 52% respectively when the context window is expanded to 8192.

A Case Study on Bar Charts with Varying Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06837v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been adopted for a variety of visualizations tasks, but how far are we from perceptually aware LLMs that can predict human takeaways? Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as spatial layouts. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs exhibit such sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout. Overall, our case study evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human chart takeaways.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (Proc.

To improve the reliability of LLMs, recent research has focused on uncertainty quantification to predict whether a response is correct or not. However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on questions requiring a single clear answer, ignoring the existence of data uncertainty that arises from irreducible randomness. Instead, these methods only consider model uncertainty, which arises from a lack of knowledge. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that entropy and consistency-based methods estimate the model uncertainty well even under data uncertainty, while other methods for white- and black-box LLMs struggle depending on the tasks. Additionally, methods designed for white-box LLMs suffer from overconfidence in reasoning tasks compared to simple knowledge queries. We believe our observations will pave the way for future work on uncertainty quantification in realistic setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLSPilot: LLM-based High-Level Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06810v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed an upsurge in automatic code generation, garnering significant attention for register transfer level (RTL) code generation. Despite the potential of RTL code generation with natural language, it remains error-prone and limited to relatively small modules because of the substantial semantic gap between natural language expressions and hardware design intent. In response to the limitations, we propose a methodology that reduces the semantic gaps by utilizing C/C++ for generating hardware designs via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools. Basically, we build a set of C-to-HLS optimization strategies catering to various code patterns, such as nested loops and local arrays. Then, we apply these strategies to sequential C/C++ code through in-context learning, which provides the LLMs with exemplary C/C++ to HLS prompts. With this approach, HLS designs can be generated effectively. Since LLMs still face problems in determining the optimized pragma parameters precisely, we have a design space exploration (DSE) tool integrated for pragma parameter tuning. Furthermore, we also employ profiling tools to pinpoint the performance bottlenecks within a program and selectively convert bottleneck components to HLS code for hardware acceleration. By combining the LLM-based profiling, C/C++ to HLS translation, and DSE, we have established HLSPilot, the first LLM-enabled high-level synthesis framework, which can fully automate the high-level application acceleration on hybrid CPU-FPGA architectures. According to our experiments on real-world application benchmarks, HLSPilot achieve comparable performance in general and can even outperform manually crafted counterparts, thereby underscoring the substantial promise of LLM-assisted hardware designs.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) learn extensive knowledge from large corpora with powerful context modeling, which is ideal for mitigating the limitations of previous methods. Directly fine-tuning LLMs offers great capability but comes at the cost of huge time and memory consumption, while utilizing frozen LLMs yields suboptimal results. In this work, we aim to leverage LLMs for KGC effectively and efficiently. We capture the context-aware hidden states of knowledge triples by employing prompts to stimulate the intermediate layers of LLMs. We then train a data-efficient classifier on these hidden states to harness the inherent capabilities of frozen LLMs in KGC. We also generate entity descriptions with subgraph sampling on KGs, reducing the ambiguity of triplets and enriching the knowledge representation. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We outperform classical KGC methods on most datasets and match the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. Additionally, compared to fine-tuned LLMs, we boost GPU memory efficiency by \textbf{$188\times$} and speed up training+inference by \textbf{$13.48\times$}.</p></details> |  |

However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in CoLM 2024</p></details> |

However, the code generated on basis of a so called "prompt" by the programmer does not always meet accepted security standards. On the one hand, this may be due to lack of best-practice examples in the training data. On the other hand, the actual quality of the programmers prompt appears to influence whether generated code contains weaknesses or not. In this paper we analyse 4 major LLMs with respect to the security of generated code. We do this on basis of a case study for the Python and Javascript language, using the MITRE CWE catalogue as the guiding security definition. Our results show that using different prompting techniques, some LLMs initially generate 65% code which is deemed insecure by a trained security engineer. On the other hand almost all analysed LLMs will eventually generate code being close to 100% secure with increasing manual guidance of a skilled engineer.</p></details> |  |

Two sets of experiments were conducted using cosine similarity and next sentence/token prediction as experimental methods. The results in experiment 1 showed that, both models interpret some as pragmatic implicature not all in the absence of context, aligning with human language processing. In experiment 2, in which Question Under Discussion (QUD) was presented as a contextual cue, BERT showed consistent performance regardless of types of QUDs, while GPT-2 encountered processing difficulties since a certain type of QUD required pragmatic inference for implicature. The findings revealed that, in terms of theoretical approaches, BERT inherently incorporates pragmatic implicature not all within the term some, adhering to Default model (Levinson, 2000). In contrast, GPT-2 seems to encounter processing difficulties in inferring pragmatic implicature within context, consistent with Context-driven model (Sperber and Wilson, 2002).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This research was presented at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference, held on August 11-16</p></details> |

Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames.

Automated resume screening systems often encompass a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes. Our framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each resume from a large dataset. Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for decision-making. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from actual resumes and simulated a resume screening process. Subsequently, the outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed analysis. The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching 87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase. In the resume summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline performance of the GPT-3.5 model. Analysis of the decision-making efficacy of the LLM agents in the final offer stage further underscores the potential of LLM agents in transforming resume screening processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by Journal of Information Processing,(2024), 18 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

Existing approaches often necessitate expensive language model retraining and limited adaptability. Additionally, the current focus on zero-shot performance improvements offers insufficient guidance for task-specific tuning. We propose CROME, an efficient vision-language instruction tuning framework. It features a novel gated cross-modal adapter that effectively combines visual and textual representations prior to input into a frozen LLM. This lightweight adapter, trained with minimal parameters, enables efficient cross-modal understanding. Notably, CROME demonstrates superior zero-shot performance on standard visual question answering and instruction-following benchmarks. Moreover, it yields fine-tuning with exceptional parameter efficiency, competing with task-specific specialist state-of-the-art methods. CROME demonstrates the potential of pre-LM alignment for building scalable, adaptable, and parameter-efficient multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

Our study investigates this issue by developing a framework to systematically study and quantify position bias using metrics such as repetitional consistency, positional consistency, and positional fairness. We conduct experiments with 9 judge models across 22 tasks from the MTBench and DevBench benchmarks and nearly 40 answer-generating models, generating approximately 80,000 evaluation instances. This comprehensive assessment reveals significant variations in bias across judges and tasks. Although GPT-4 often excels in positional consistency and fairness, some more cost-effective models perform comparably or even better in specific tasks, highlighting essential trade-offs between consistency, fairness, and cost. Our results also demonstrate high consistency of judgment across repetitions, confirming that position bias is not due to random variations. This research significantly contributes to the field by introducing new concepts for understanding position bias and providing a multi-dimensional framework for evaluation. These insights guide the selection of optimal judge models, enhance benchmark design, and lay the foundation for future research into effective debiasing strategies, ultimately enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, around 200 figures and subfigures</p></details> |

Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, \ie, how their feelings change when presented with specific situations.

However, how to employ strategies, a set of motivational interviewing (MI) skills, to generate therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability is underexplored. We propose an approach called strategy-aware dialogue generation with Chain-of-Strategy (CoS) planning, which first predicts MI strategies as reasoning and utilizes these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue generation. It brings the potential for controllable and explainable generation in psychotherapy by aligning the generated MI dialogues with therapeutic strategies. Extensive experiments including automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MI strategy. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic settings.</p></details> |  |

However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel "Formal-LLM" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

Let's Take TravelPlanner as an Example](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06318v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought autonomous agents closer to artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their promising generalization and emergent capabilities. There is, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-based agents behave, why they could potentially fail, and how to improve them, particularly in demanding real-world planning tasks. In this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we present our study using a realistic benchmark, TravelPlanner, where an agent must meet multiple constraints to generate accurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to address four key research questions: (1) are LLM agents robust enough to lengthy and noisy contexts when it comes to reasoning and planning? (2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact the performance of LLM agents in scenarios with long context? (3) can we rely on refinement to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning LLMs with both positive and negative feedback lead to further improvement? Our comprehensive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs often fail to attend to crucial parts of a long context, despite their ability to handle extensive reference information and few-shot examples; secondly, they still struggle with analyzing the long plans and cannot provide accurate feedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose Feedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which leverages both positive and negative feedback, resulting in substantial gains over Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

However, acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.</p></details> |  |

Thus far, diversity has been studied via metrics such as $n$-gram diversity or diversity of BERT embeddings. However, for these kinds of diversity, the user has little control over the dimensions along which diversity is considered. For example, in the poetry domain, one might desire diversity in terms of rhyme and meter, whereas in the code domain, one might desire diversity in terms of the kinds of expressions used to solve a problem. We propose a diversity metric called structural diversity, where the user provides a mapping from generated text to features capturing the kinds of diversity that they care about. In addition, we propose a novel strategy called chain-of-specification (CoS) prompting for improving diversity by first having the LLM generate a specification encoding one instance of structural features, and then prompting the LLM to generate text that satisfies these features; notably, our strategy works with blackbox LLMs. In our experiments, we show that for structural diversity in the poetry and code domains, CoS significantly improves diversity compared to several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as truthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination, and user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improved the detection of hallucination without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.

This process involves collecting, indexing, retrieving, and providing information to an LLM for generating responses. Despite its growing popularity due to its flexibility and low cost, the security implications of RAG have not been extensively studied. The data for such systems are often collected from public sources, providing an attacker a gateway for indirect prompt injections to manipulate the responses of the model. In this paper, we investigate the security of RAG systems against end-to-end indirect prompt manipulations. First, we review existing RAG framework pipelines, deriving a prototypical architecture and identifying critical parameters. We then examine prior works searching for techniques that attackers can use to perform indirect prompt manipulations. Finally, we implemented Rag 'n Roll, a framework to determine the effectiveness of attacks against end-to-end RAG applications. Our results show that existing attacks are mostly optimized to boost the ranking of malicious documents during the retrieval phase. However, a higher rank does not immediately translate into a reliable attack. Most attacks, against various configurations, settle around a 40% success rate, which could rise to 60% when considering ambiguous answers as successful attacks (those that include the expected benign one as well). Additionally, when using unoptimized documents, attackers deploying two of them (or more) for a target query can achieve similar results as those using optimized ones. Finally, exploration of the configuration space of a RAG showed limited impact in thwarting the attacks, where the most successful combination severely undermines functionality.</p></details> |  |

| **[LUT Tensor Core: Lookup Table Enables Efficient Low-Bit LLM Inference Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06003v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language model (LLM) inference demands ever-greater resources, there is a rapid growing trend of using low-bit weights to shrink memory usage and boost inference efficiency. However, these low-bit LLMs introduce the need for mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM), which is a crucial yet under-explored operation that involves multiplying lower-precision weights with higher-precision activations. Unfortunately, current hardware does not natively support mpGEMM, resulting in indirect and inefficient dequantization-based implementations. To address the mpGEMM requirements in low-bit LLMs, we explored the lookup table (LUT)-based approach for mpGEMM. However, a conventional LUT implementation falls short of its potential. To fully harness the power of LUT-based mpGEMM, we introduce LUT Tensor Core, a software-hardware co-design optimized for low-bit LLM inference. Specifically, we introduce software-based operator fusion and table symmetrization techniques to optimize table precompute and table storage, respectively. Then, LUT Tensor Core proposes the hardware design featuring an elongated tiling shape design to enhance table reuse and a bit-serial design to support various precision combinations in mpGEMM. Moreover, we design an end-to-end compilation stack with new instructions for LUT-based mpGEMM, enabling efficient LLM compilation and optimizations. The evaluation on low-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet, LLAMA) shows that LUT Tensor Core achieves more than a magnitude of improvements on both compute density and energy efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[TestART: Improving LLM-based Unit Test via Co-evolution of Automated Generation and Repair Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03095v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort. The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities. However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates. (3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts. In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned. TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration. TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods. In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.</p></details> |  |

Research indicates that LLM performance hinges on the density and position of key information in the input prompt. Inspired by these findings, we propose LongLLMLingua for prompt compression towards improving LLMs' perception of the key information to simultaneously address the three challenges. Our extensive evaluation across various long context scenarios demonstrates that LongLLMLingua not only enhances performance but also significantly reduces costs and latency. For instance, in the NaturalQuestions benchmark, LongLLMLingua boosts performance by up to 21.4% with around 4x fewer tokens in GPT-3.5-Turbo, leading to substantial cost savings. It achieves a 94.0% cost reduction in the LooGLE benchmark. Moreover, when compressing prompts of about 10k tokens at ratios of 2x-6x, LongLLMLingua can accelerate end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.6x. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LongLLMLingua.</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2024 |

One opinion, especially from some startups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the long-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper, we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of \emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer, but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage, the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions, which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately, every agent/person should have its own large personal model, a deep neural network model (thus \emph{AI-native}) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory, even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally, we discuss the significant potential of AI-native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement, personalization, distribution, and social in the AGI era, as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.</p></details> |  |

Despite its potential to foster innovative solutions, the complexity and abstractness of TRIZ methodology often make its acquisition and application challenging. This often requires users to have a deep understanding of the theory, as well as substantial practical experience and knowledge across various disciplines. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to address these challenges by leveraging their extensive knowledge bases and reasoning capabilities for innovative solution generation within TRIZ-based problem-solving process. This study explores and evaluates the application of LLMs within the TRIZ-based problem-solving process. The construction of TRIZ case collections establishes a solid empirical foundation for our experiments and offers valuable resources to the TRIZ community. A specifically designed workflow, utilizing step-by-step reasoning and evaluation-validated prompt strategies, effectively transforms concrete problems into TRIZ problems and finally generates inventive solutions. Finally, we present a case study in mechanical engineering field that highlights the practical application of this LLM-augmented method. It showcases GPT-4's ability to generate solutions that closely resonate with original solutions and suggests more implementation mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Such assistants must be able to 1) encode relevant visual history from the assistant's sensors, e.g., camera, 2) forecast future actions for accomplishing the activity, and 3) replan based on the user in the loop. To evaluate the first two capabilities, grounding visual history and forecasting in short and long horizons, we conduct benchmarking of two prominent classes of multimodal LLM approaches -- Socratic Models and Vision Conditioned Language Models (VCLMs) on video-based action anticipation tasks using offline datasets. These offline benchmarks, however, do not allow us to close the loop with the user, which is essential to evaluate the replanning capabilities and measure successful activity completion in assistive scenarios. To that end, we conduct a first-of-its-kind user study, with 18 participants performing 3 different multi-step cooking activities while wearing an egocentric observation device called Aria and following assistance from multimodal LLMs. We find that the Socratic approach outperforms VCLMs in both offline and online settings. We further highlight how grounding long visual history, common in activity assistance, remains challenging in current models, especially for VCLMs, and demonstrate that offline metrics do not indicate online performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

These LLMs, exemplified by OpenAI's ChatGPT, have revolutionized the way we approach language understanding and generation tasks. However, in contrast to traditional software development practices, LLM development introduces new challenges for AI developers in design, implementation, and deployment. These challenges span different areas (such as prompts, APIs, and plugins), requiring developers to navigate unique methodologies and considerations specific to LLM development. Despite the profound influence of LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, these challenges have not been thoroughly investigated in previous empirical studies. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study on understanding the challenges faced by LLM developers. Specifically, we crawl and analyze 29,057 relevant questions from a popular OpenAI developer forum. We first examine their popularity and difficulty. After manually analyzing 2,364 sampled questions, we construct a taxonomy of challenges faced by LLM developers. Based on this taxonomy, we summarize a set of findings and actionable implications for LLM-related stakeholders, including developers and providers (especially the OpenAI organization).</p></details> | 29 pages, 15 figures |

However, even experienced faculty teams find it challenging to realize a holistic evaluation that accommodates diverse perspectives. Adequate deliberation is essential to integrate varied assessments, but faculty often lack the time for such exchanges. Deriving an average score without discussion undermines the purpose of a holistic evaluation. Therefore, this paper explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a facilitator to integrate diverse faculty assessments. Scenario-based experiments were conducted to determine if the LLM could integrate diverse evaluations and explain the underlying pedagogical theories to faculty. The results were noteworthy, showing that the LLM can effectively facilitate faculty discussions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated the capability to create evaluation criteria by generalizing a single scenario-based experiment, leveraging its already acquired pedagogical domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version appears in the proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Creating Arabic LLM Prompts at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05882v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The debut of chatGPT and BARD has popularized instruction following text generation using LLMs, where a user can interrogate an LLM using natural language requests and obtain natural language answers that matches their requests. Training LLMs to respond in this manner requires a large number of worked out examples of user requests (aka prompts) with corresponding gold responses. In this paper, we introduce two methods for creating such prompts for Arabic cheaply and quickly. The first methods entails automatically translating existing prompt datasets from English, such as PromptSource and Super-NaturalInstructions, and then using machine translation quality estimation to retain high quality translations only. The second method involves creating natural language prompts on top of existing Arabic NLP datasets. Using these two methods we were able to create more than 67.4 million Arabic prompts that cover a variety of tasks including summarization, headline generation, grammar checking, open/closed question answering, creative writing, etc. We show that fine tuning an open 7 billion parameter large language model, namely base Qwen2 7B, enables it to outperform a state-of-the-art 70 billion parameter instruction tuned model, namely Llama3 70B, in handling Arabic prompts.</p></details> |  |

Manual classification of products is time-consuming and error-prone, and the sheer volume of products imported and exported renders the manual process infeasible. Consequently, e-commerce platforms and enterprises involved in international trade have turned to automatic product classification using machine learning. However, current approaches do not consider the real-world challenges associated with product classification, such as very abbreviated and incomplete product descriptions. In addition, recent advancements in generative Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities are mainly untapped in product classification and e-commerce. In this research, we explore the real-life challenges of industrial classification and we propose data perturbations that allow for realistic data simulation. Furthermore, we employ LLM-based product classification to improve the robustness of the prediction in presence of incomplete data. Our research shows that LLMs with in-context learning outperform the supervised approaches in the clean-data scenario. Additionally, we illustrate that LLMs are significantly more robust than the supervised approaches when data attacks are present.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria. (2) We develop LLM Reasoners, a library for standardized modular implementation of existing and new reasoning algorithms, under a unified formulation of the search, reward, and world model components. With the new evaluation and library, (3) we conduct extensive study of different reasoning approaches (e.g., CoT, ToT, RAP). The analysis reveals interesting findings about different factors contributing to reasoning, including the reward-guidance, breadth-vs-depth in search, world model, and prompt formats, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.llm-reasoners.net/</p></details> |

Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\times$ and 1.25$\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[A Decoding Acceleration Framework for Industrial Deployable LLM-based Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05676v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, increasing attention has been paid to LLM-based recommender systems, but their deployment is still under exploration in the industry. Most deployments utilize LLMs as feature enhancers, generating augmentation knowledge in the offline stage. However, in recommendation scenarios, involving numerous users and items, even offline generation with LLMs consumes considerable time and resources. This generation inefficiency stems from the autoregressive nature of LLMs, and a promising direction for acceleration is speculative decoding, a Draft-then-Verify paradigm that increases the number of generated tokens per decoding step. In this paper, we first identify that recommendation knowledge generation is suitable for retrieval-based speculative decoding. Then, we discern two characteristics: (1) extensive items and users in RSs bring retrieval inefficiency, and (2) RSs exhibit high diversity tolerance for text generated by LLMs. Based on the above insights, we propose a Decoding Acceleration Framework for LLM-based Recommendation (dubbed DARE), with Customized Retrieval Pool to improve retrieval efficiency and Relaxed Verification to increase the acceptance rate of draft tokens, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARE achieves a 3-5x speedup and is compatible with various frameworks and backbone LLMs. DARE has also been deployed to online advertising scenarios within a large-scale commercial environment, achieving a 3.45x speedup while maintaining the downstream performance.</p></details> |  |

Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments.

This paper focuses on task-specific data pruning and selection to enhance fine-tuning. We introduce an innovative framework, termed P3, which improves LLM performance through a dynamic, adaptive training strategy. Specifically, P3 comprises the following components: (1) Policy-driven Difficulty Measurement: we begin by measuring the difficulty of data based on the model's real-time performance, transitioning from static, predefined metrics to more dynamic and adaptable ones. (2) Pace-adaptive Selection: we employ self-paced learning (SPL) to gradually select increasingly challenging data, thereby progressively enhancing the model's performance. (3) Diversity Promotion: we integrate Determinantal Point Process (DPP) into the selection process to promote the diversity within and between samples, enriching the learning process. We have validated our method on two well-known LLM datasets, APPS and MATH, designed for logical reasoning scenarios. The results show that our P3 framework significantly improves training outcomes compared to traditional methods. By fundamentally refining data selection and utilization strategies, P3 not only advances theoretical understanding of dynamic training approaches but also provides a versatile framework that can revolutionize model training in natural language processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Replace Manual Annotation of Software Engineering Artifacts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05534v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental evaluations of software engineering innovations, e.g., tools and processes, often include human-subject studies as a component of a multi-pronged strategy to obtain greater generalizability of the findings. However, human-subject studies in our field are challenging, due to the cost and difficulty of finding and employing suitable subjects, ideally, professional programmers with varying degrees of experience. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have recently started to demonstrate human-level performance in several areas. This paper explores the possibility of substituting costly human subjects with much cheaper LLM queries in evaluations of code and code-related artifacts. We study this idea by applying six state-of-the-art LLMs to ten annotation tasks from five datasets created by prior work, such as judging the accuracy of a natural language summary of a method or deciding whether a code change fixes a static analysis warning. Our results show that replacing some human annotation effort with LLMs can produce inter-rater agreements equal or close to human-rater agreement. To help decide when and how to use LLMs in human-subject studies, we propose model-model agreement as a predictor of whether a given task is suitable for LLMs at all, and model confidence as a means to select specific samples where LLMs can safely replace human annotators. Overall, our work is the first step toward mixed human-LLM evaluations in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

These efforts not only include innovations in the algorithm and software domains but also constitute developments of various hardware acceleration techniques. Nevertheless, there is a lack of simulation infrastructure capable of accurately modeling versatile hardware-software behaviors in LLM serving systems without extensively extending the simulation time. This paper aims to develop an effective simulation tool, called LLMServingSim, to support future research in LLM serving systems. In designing LLMServingSim, we focus on two limitations of existing simulators: (1) they lack consideration of the dynamic workload variations of LLM inference serving due to its autoregressive nature, and (2) they incur repetitive simulations without leveraging algorithmic redundancies in LLMs. To address these limitations, LLMServingSim simulates the LLM serving in the granularity of iterations, leveraging the computation redundancies across decoder blocks and reusing the simulation results from previous iterations. Additionally, LLMServingSim provides a flexible framework that allows users to plug in any accelerator compiler-and-simulation stacks for exploring various system designs with heterogeneous processors. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMServingSim produces simulation results closely following the performance behaviors of real GPU-based LLM serving system with less than 14.7% error rate, while offering 91.5x faster simulation speed compared to existing accelerator simulators.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

However, existing studies based on graph neural networks and language models either suffer from the limitations of numerous training needed toward specific downstream predictions or have shallow semantic features. In this work, we propose a novel Path-LLM model to learn unified graph representation, which leverages a powerful large language model (LLM) to incorporate our proposed path features. Our Path-LLM framework consists of several well-designed techniques. First, we develop a new mechanism of long-to-short shortest path (L2SP) selection, which covers essential connections between different dense groups. An in-depth comparison of different path selection plans is offered to illustrate the strength of our designed L2SP. Then, we design path textualization to obtain L2SP-based training texts. Next, we feed the texts into a self-supervised LLM training process to learn embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of Path-LLM against the state-of-the-art WalkLM method on two classical graph learning tasks (node classification and link prediction) and one NP-hard graph query processing task (keyword search), meanwhile saving more than 90% of training paths.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, the adversarial robustness of these models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to investigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness of LLMs by comparing three prominent models with varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and AdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial samples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the GLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE tasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative robustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack levels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to achieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial robustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource constraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces DocMath-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the numerical reasoning capabilities of LLMs in the context of understanding and analyzing specialized documents containing both text and tables. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 48 LLMs with Chain-of-Thought and Program-of-Thought prompting methods, aiming to comprehensively assess the capabilities and limitations of existing LLMs in DocMath-Eval. We found that even the current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4o) still significantly lags behind human experts in solving complex numerical reasoning problems grounded in long contexts. We believe that DocMath-Eval can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in solving challenging numerical reasoning problems within expert domains.</p></details> | ACL 2024 Oral |
| **[Psychological Profiling in Cybersecurity: A Look at LLMs and Psycholinguistic Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18783v3)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing sophistication of cyber threats necessitates innovative approaches to cybersecurity. In this paper, we explore the potential of psychological profiling techniques, particularly focusing on the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and psycholinguistic features. We investigate the intersection of psychology and cybersecurity, discussing how LLMs can be employed to analyze textual data for identifying psychological traits of threat actors. We explore the incorporation of psycholinguistic features, such as linguistic patterns and emotional cues, into cybersecurity frameworks. Our research underscores the importance of integrating psychological perspectives into cybersecurity practices to bolster defense mechanisms against evolving threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text Clustering with LLM Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15112v4)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model (KG-LLM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph tasks. We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations. To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework's potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen prompts. Experimental results show that KG-LLM significantly improves the models' generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions in unfamiliar scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[How Well Do LLMs Identify Cultural Unity in Diversity?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05102v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much work on the cultural awareness of large language models (LLMs) focuses on the models' sensitivity to geo-cultural diversity. However, in addition to cross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures. For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similar cultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturing cross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans. Moreover, geo-cultural proximity shows a weak influence on model performance in capturing cross-cultural associations.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

A 5000h pseudo labeled dataset containing open source and self collected speech data is used for training. We achieve performance comparable to other open source models trained with up to hundreds of thousands of hours of labeled speech data. Meanwhile, experiments conducted on Covost2 Zh2en testset suggest that our model outperforms other open source Speech LLMs. A BLEU score of 25.2 can be obtained. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, this paper presents a training strategy for encoders and LLMs on speech related tasks (including ASR and AST) using a small size of pseudo labeled data without any extra manual annotation and selection. Second, we release our ASR and AST models and plan to open-source our training code and strategy in the near future. Moreover, a model trained on 8wh scale training data is planned to be released later on.</p></details> |  |
| **[Examining the Behavior of LLM Architectures Within the Framework of Standardized National Exams in Brazil](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05035v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Exame Nacional do Ensino M\'edio (ENEM) is a pivotal test for Brazilian students, required for admission to a significant number of universities in Brazil. The test consists of four objective high-school level tests on Math, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Languages, and one writing essay. Students' answers to the test and to the accompanying socioeconomic status questionnaire are made public every year (albeit anonymized) due to transparency policies from the Brazilian Government. In the context of large language models (LLMs), these data lend themselves nicely to comparing different groups of humans with AI, as we can have access to human and machine answer distributions. We leverage these characteristics of the ENEM dataset and compare GPT-3.5 and 4, and MariTalk, a model trained using Portuguese data, to humans, aiming to ascertain how their answers relate to real societal groups and what that may reveal about the model biases. We divide the human groups by using socioeconomic status (SES), and compare their answer distribution with LLMs for each question and for the essay. We find no significant biases when comparing LLM performance to humans on the multiple-choice Brazilian Portuguese tests, as the distance between model and human answers is mostly determined by the human accuracy. A similar conclusion is found by looking at the generated text as, when analyzing the essays, we observe that human and LLM essays differ in a few key factors, one being the choice of words where model essays were easily separable from human ones. The texts also differ syntactically, with LLM generated essays exhibiting, on average, smaller sentences and less thought units, among other differences. These results suggest that, for Brazilian Portuguese in the ENEM context, LLM outputs represent no group of humans, being significantly different from the answers from Brazilian students across all tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Seventh AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics and Society (AIES 2024). 14 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Instruction Tuning-free Visual Token Complement for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05019v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the open community of large language models (LLMs) matures, multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have promised an elegant bridge between vision and language. However, current research is inherently constrained by challenges such as the need for high-quality instruction pairs and the loss of visual information in image-to-text training objectives. To this end, we propose a Visual Token Complement framework (VTC) that helps MLLMs regain the missing visual features and thus improve response accuracy. Specifically, our VTC integrates text-to-image generation as a guide to identifying the text-irrelevant features, and a visual selector is then developed to generate complementary visual tokens to enrich the original visual input. Moreover, an iterative strategy is further designed to extract more visual information by iteratively using the visual selector without any additional training. Notably, the training pipeline requires no additional image-text pairs, resulting in a desired instruction tuning-free property. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our VTC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024 (20pages)</p></details> |
| **[Cost-Effective Hallucination Detection for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21424v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be prone to hallucinations - generating unreliable outputs that are unfaithful to their inputs, external facts or internally inconsistent. In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to GenAI Evaluation Workshop at KDD 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing the Code Debugging Ability of LLMs via Communicative Agent Based Data Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05006v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a vital aspect of software development, yet the debugging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. This paper first introduces DEBUGEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the debugging capabilities of LLMs. DEBUGEVAL collects data from existing high-quality datasets and designs four different tasks to evaluate the debugging effectiveness, including BUG Localization, BUG Identification, Code Review, and Code Repair. Additionally, to enhance the code debugging ability of LLMs, this paper proposes a CoMmunicative Agent BaSed DaTa REfinement FRamework (MASTER), which generates the refined code debugging data for supervised finetuning. Specifically, MASTER employs the Code Quizzer to generate refined data according to the defined tasks of DEBUGEVAL. Then the Code Learner acts as a critic and reserves the generated problems that it can not solve. Finally, the Code Teacher provides a detailed Chain-of-Thought based solution to deal with the generated problem. We collect the synthesized data and finetune the Code Learner to enhance the debugging ability and conduct the NeuDebugger model. Our experiments evaluate various LLMs and NeuDebugger in the zero-shot setting on DEBUGEVAL. Experimental results demonstrate that these 7B-scale LLMs have weaker debugging capabilities, even these code-oriented LLMs. On the contrary, these larger models (over 70B) show convincing debugging ability. Our further analyses illustrate that MASTER is an effective method to enhance the code debugging ability by synthesizing data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.</p></details> | Accepted at AIES24 |

On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop MT-Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. MT-Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving MT-Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained MT-Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, MT-Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XX-En), and MT-Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4. Extensive ablation and analysis corroborate the effectiveness of MT-Ladder in diverse settings.

| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals. Codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrajCogn-5021.</p></details> |  |

Existing IoT systems, however, are limited in their capacity to handle complex tasks, particularly in their interactions with humans to accomplish these tasks. In this paper, we present LLMind, an LLM-based task-oriented AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices, with humans communicating high-level verbal instructions, to perform complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation of Standard Statistical Models and LLMs on Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04867v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction. We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness. The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components, as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-tuning Aligns LLMs to the Human Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00575v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuning is a widely adopted finetuning method that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate output that more closely resembles human responses. However, no studies have shown that instruction-tuning actually teaches LLMs to process language in a similar manner as humans. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on aligning LLM and human language processing mechanisms in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences, and find that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment (~6%), but has no similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify factors underlying this improvement in brain alignment, we compute correlations between brain alignment and various LLM properties, such as model size, problem-solving, and world knowledge understanding. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that the mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

We introduce the concept of Large Language Model Development Lifecycle (LDLC) and then highlight the importance of consistency test in ensuring the delivery quality. The principled solution of consistency test, however, is usually overlooked by industrial practitioners and not urgent in academia, and current practical solutions are insufficiently rigours and labor-intensive. We thus propose a simple yet effective consistency test protocol, named SimCT. SimCT is mainly to proactively check the consistency across different development stages of "bare metal" LLMs or associated services without accessing the model artifacts, in an attempt to expedite the delivery by reducing the back-and-forth alignment communications among multiple teams involved in different development stages. Specifically, SimCT encompasses response-wise and model-wise tests. We implement the protocol with LightGBM and Student's t-test for two components respectively, and perform extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of SimCT and the involved components.</p></details> |  |

An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and the difficult task of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[h4rm3l: A Dynamic Benchmark of Composable Jailbreak Attacks for LLM Safety Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04811v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world. Warning: This paper and related research artifacts contain offensive and potentially disturbing prompts and model-generated content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tamper-Resistant Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00761v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised widespread concerns regarding their potential for malicious use. Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://www.tamper-resistant-safeguards.com</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking LLM-based Preference Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01085v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language model (LLM)-based preference evaluations has become widespread for comparing model responses, but it has revealed a notable bias towards longer responses, questioning the reliability of such evaluations. This paper explores the length bias in LLM evaluations from a data-centric perspective, analyzing 14 commonly used preference datasets and 10 reward models. Our findings indicate that human preference labeling favors longer responses and this spurious correlation is learned by the reward model and subsequently propagated to the aligned model during training. We decompose the preference evaluation metric, i.e., win rate, from the perspective of human to identify the deeper factors and conclude that the win rate is affected by two axes of model response: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness, and the latter is length-dependent and can be represented by conditional entropy. Controlled experiments demonstrate that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To ensure reliable evaluation metrics that assess content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, by adjusting the lengths of reference answers to match the test model's answers within the same interval, we debias information mass relative to length, ensuring a fair model evaluation. Furthermore, we investigate length bias in DPO using AlpacaEval and AdapAlpaca. By testing Tulu2 and Tulu2-dpo at 7B, 13B, and 70B scales, we found that DPO leads to higher human preference, but this gain is amplified by response length, with AlpacaEval showing higher win rates gain than AdapAlpaca.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread adoption, ongoing research continues to explore new ways to integrate LLMs into diverse systems. This paper explores new techniques to harness the power of LLMs for 6G (6th Generation) wireless communication technologies, a domain where automation and intelligent systems are pivotal. The inherent adaptability of LLMs to domain-specific tasks positions them as prime candidates for enhancing wireless systems in the 6G landscape. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework that leverages LLMs for network deployment in wireless communications. Our approach involves training an RL agent, utilizing LLMs as its core, in an urban setting to maximize coverage. The agent's objective is to navigate the complexities of urban environments and identify the network parameters for optimal area coverage. Additionally, we integrate LLMs with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capitalize on their strengths while mitigating their limitations. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed for training purposes. The results suggest that LLM-assisted models can outperform CNN-based models in some cases while performing at least as well in others.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy issues. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They show a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare state and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in the areas of foreign policy and migration.</p></details> | 12 pages, TACL |

In this study, we introduce $\textbf{Fusion-LLM}$, a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing paradigms tailored to address challenges in Inertial Confinement Fusion ($\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we propose the $\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a fusion-specific prompt, enabling accurate forecasting of hot electron dynamics during implosion. Secondly, we develop $\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to temporally and spatially describe the laser intensity across time, capturing the unique characteristics of $\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the $\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting, providing valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\texttt{ICF}$ process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11 $\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\texttt{HXR}$) energies of $\texttt{ICF}$ tasks, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against concurrent best systems.

Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible behaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks between unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address this challenge, but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We propose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically compose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov Decision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the control state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that are restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts to the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and web environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM. On WebArena, SteP improves (14.9\% to 33.5\%) over SOTA that use GPT-4 policies, while on MiniWob++, SteP is competitive with prior works while using significantly less data. Our code and data are available at https://asappresearch.github.io/webagents-step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference on Language Modeling (COLM) 2024. 30 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[LUNAR: Unsupervised LLM-based Log Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07174v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log parsing serves as an essential prerequisite for various log analysis tasks. Recent advancements in this field have improved parsing accuracy by leveraging the semantics in logs through fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) or learning from in-context demonstrations. However, these methods heavily depend on labeled examples to achieve optimal performance. In practice, collecting sufficient labeled data is challenging due to the large scale and continuous evolution of logs, leading to performance degradation of existing log parsers after deployment. To address this issue, we propose LUNAR, an unsupervised LLM-based method for efficient and off-the-shelf log parsing. Our key insight is that while LLMs may struggle with direct log parsing, their performance can be significantly enhanced through comparative analysis across multiple logs that differ only in their parameter parts. We refer to such groups of logs as Log Contrastive Units (LCUs). Given the vast volume of logs, obtaining LCUs is difficult. Therefore, LUNAR introduces a hybrid ranking scheme to effectively search for LCUs by jointly considering the commonality and variability among logs. Additionally, LUNAR crafts a novel parsing prompt for LLMs to identify contrastive patterns and extract meaningful log structures from LCUs. Experiments on large-scale public datasets demonstrate that LUNAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art log parsers in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing an effective and scalable solution for real-world deployment. \footnote{The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Jun-jie-Huang/LUNAR}}.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we characterize sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) based LLM fine-tuning to understand their accuracy and runtime performance on a single GPU. Our evaluation provides unique insights into the training efficacy of sparse and dense versions of MoE models, as well as their runtime characteristics, including maximum batch size, execution time breakdown, end-to-end throughput, GPU hardware utilization, and load distribution. Our study identifies the optimization of the MoE layer as crucial for further improving the performance of LLM fine-tuning. Using our profiling results, we also develop and validate an analytical model to estimate the cost of LLM fine-tuning on the cloud. This model, based on parameters of the model and GPU architecture, estimates LLM throughput and the cost of training, aiding practitioners in industry and academia to budget the cost of fine-tuning a specific model.</p></details> | 10 pages, conference |

A Dynamic Multi-agent Framework for Competitive Debate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04472v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive debate is a comprehensive and complex computational argumentation task. Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter hallucinations and lack competitiveness in this task. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent for Debate (Agent4Debate), a dynamic, multi-agent framework based on LLMs designed to enhance their capabilities in competitive debate. Drawing inspiration from human behavior in debate preparation and execution, Agent4Debate employs a collaborative architecture where four specialized agents (Searcher, Analyzer, Writer, and Reviewer) dynamically interact and cooperate. These agents work throughout the debate process, covering multiple stages from initial research and argument formulation to rebuttal and summary. To comprehensively evaluate framework performance, we construct the Chinese Debate Arena, comprising 66 carefully selected Chinese debate motions. We recruite ten experienced human debaters and collect records of 200 debates involving Agent4Debate, baseline models, and humans. The evaluation employs the Debatrix automatic scoring system and professional human reviewers based on the established Debatrix-Elo and Human-Elo ranking. Experimental results indicate that the state-of-the-art Agent4Debate exhibits capabilities comparable to those of humans. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the agent structure.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

However, the unmitigated deployment of LLM-based embodied systems in real-world environments may pose potential physical risks, such as property damage and personal injury. Existing security benchmarks for LLMs overlook risk awareness for LLM-based embodied agents. To address this gap, we propose RiskAwareBench, an automated framework designed to assess physical risks awareness in LLM-based embodied agents. RiskAwareBench consists of four modules: safety tips generation, risky scene generation, plan generation, and evaluation, enabling comprehensive risk assessment with minimal manual intervention. Utilizing this framework, we compile the PhysicalRisk dataset, encompassing diverse scenarios with associated safety tips, observations, and instructions. Extensive experiments reveal that most LLMs exhibit insufficient physical risk awareness, and baseline risk mitigation strategies yield limited enhancement, which emphasizes the urgency and cruciality of improving risk awareness in LLM-based embodied agents in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03354v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the accuracy of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [7] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of 500 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums, XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP, was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and code 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed strikingly well, with an average accuracy score of 98%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the efficiency and relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</p></details> |  |

In journalism, integrating AI poses unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in enhancing the quality and efficiency of news reporting. This study explores how LLMs and LMMs can assist journalistic practice by generating contextualised captions for images accompanying news articles. We conducted experiments using the GoodNews dataset to evaluate the ability of LMMs (BLIP-2, GPT-4v, or LLaVA) to incorporate one of two types of context: entire news articles, or extracted named entities. In addition, we compared their performance to a two-stage pipeline composed of a captioning model (BLIP-2, OFA, or ViT-GPT2) with post-hoc contextualisation with LLMs (GPT-4 or LLaMA). We assess a diversity of models, and we find that while the choice of contextualisation model is a significant factor for the two-stage pipelines, this is not the case in the LMMs, where smaller, open-source models perform well compared to proprietary, GPT-powered ones. Additionally, we found that controlling the amount of provided context enhances performance. These results highlight the limitations of a fully automated approach and underscore the necessity for an interactive, human-in-the-loop strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards SLO-Optimized LLM Serving via Automatic Inference Engine Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04323v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A service-level objective (SLO) is a target performance metric of service that cloud vendors aim to ensure. Delivering optimized SLOs can enhance user satisfaction and improve the competitiveness of cloud vendors. As large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity across various fields, it is of great significance to optimize SLOs for LLM inference services. In this paper, we observe that adjusting the parameters of LLM inference engines can improve service performance, and the optimal parameter configurations of different services are different. Therefore, we propose SCOOT, an automatic performance tuning system to optimize SLOs for each LLM inference service by tuning the parameters of the inference engine. We first propose a generalized formulation of the tuning problem to handle various objectives and constraints between parameters, and SCOOT exploits the Bayesian optimization (BO) technique to resolve the problem via exploration and exploitation. Moreover, SCOOT adopts a random forest to learn hidden constraints during the tuning process to mitigate invalid exploration. To improve the tuning efficiency, SCOOT utilizes the parallel suggestion to accelerate the tuning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCOOT can significantly outperform existing tuning techniques in SLO optimization while greatly improving the tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of learning models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously, i.e., the All-in-One image restoration models. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters facing images with different degradation types, which causes the model to be forced to trade off between degradation types, therefore impair the total performance. To solve this problem, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based plug-in-and-play method that dynamically generated parameters for the corresponding networks based on the contents of input images. HAIR consists of 2 main components: Classifier (Cl) and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). To be more specific, the Classifier is a simple image classification network which is used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image; And the HSNs can be seen as a simple Fully-connected Neural Network that receive the GIV and output parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments shows that incorporating HAIR into the architectures can significantly improve the performance of different models on image restoration tasks at a low cost, \textbf{although HAIR only generate parameters and haven't change these models' logical structures at all.} With incorporating HAIR into the popular architecture Restormer, our method obtains superior or at least comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on a range of image restoration tasks. \href{https://github.com/toummHus/HAIR}{\textcolor{blue}{$\underline{\textbf{Code and pre-trained checkpoints are available here.}}$}}</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet based inpainting detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06429v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in image editing tools, manipulating digital images has become alarmingly easy. Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in parts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting forgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with noise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this task, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor manipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which helps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency bands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then analyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can identify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with existing forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02342v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> |  |

It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the unique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and their convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz method (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the matrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method converges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is consistent. The numerical tests verify the theoretical results and the methods presented in this paper are applied to the color image restoration problem to obtain satisfactory restored images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physical prior guided cooperative learning framework for joint turbulence degradation estimation and infrared video restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04227v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared imaging and turbulence strength measurements are in widespread demand in many fields. This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided Cooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric turbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a cyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence strength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a physical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on Cn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement accuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint loss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories. Experiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence strength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and image restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant impact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.</p></details> | 21 |

However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task. We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Posterior Proximal Sampling for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16907v2)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in generating high-quality samples. Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this paper, we present a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration. Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output stability and enhancement. The number of candidate samples used for selection is adaptively determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the timestep. Additionally, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses validate that our proposed method significantly enhances image restoration performance while consuming negligible additional computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2024 Oral</p></details> |

Recent research shows that learning discriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can significantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen extreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically adapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM24 workshop</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer for Image Fusion and Exposure Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01183v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The correction of exposure-related issues is a pivotal component in enhancing the quality of images, offering substantial implications for various computer vision tasks. Historically, most methodologies have predominantly utilized spatial domain recovery, offering limited consideration to the potentialities of the frequency domain. Additionally, there has been a lack of a unified perspective towards low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, complicating and impeding the optimization of image processing. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology that leverages the frequency domain to improve and unify the handling of exposure correction tasks. Our method introduces Holistic Frequency Attention and Dynamic Frequency Feed-Forward Network, which replace conventional correlation computation in the spatial-domain. They form a foundational building block that facilitates a U-shaped Holistic Dynamic Frequency Transformer as a filter to extract global information and dynamically select important frequency bands for image restoration. Complementing this, we employ a Laplacian pyramid to decompose images into distinct frequency bands, followed by multiple restorers, each tuned to recover specific frequency-band information. The pyramid fusion allows a more detailed and nuanced image restoration process. Ultimately, our structure unifies the three tasks of low-light enhancement, exposure correction, and multi-exposure fusion, enabling comprehensive treatment of all classical exposure errors. Benchmarking on mainstream datasets for these tasks, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results, paving the way for more sophisticated and unified solutions in exposure correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contribution-based Low-Rank Adaptation with Pre-training Model for Real Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01099v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pre-trained model and efficient parameter tuning have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and high-level computer vision with the aid of masked modeling and prompt tuning. In low-level computer vision, however, there have been limited investigations on pre-trained models and even efficient fine-tuning strategy has not yet been explored despite its importance and benefit in various real-world tasks such as alleviating memory inflation issue when integrating new tasks on AI edge devices. Here, we propose a novel efficient parameter tuning approach dubbed contribution-based low-rank adaptation (CoLoRA) for multiple image restorations along with effective pre-training method with random order degradations (PROD). Unlike prior arts that tune all network parameters, our CoLoRA effectively fine-tunes small amount of parameters by leveraging LoRA (low-rank adaptation) for each new vision task with our contribution-based method to adaptively determine layer by layer capacity for that task to yield comparable performance to full tuning. Furthermore, our PROD strategy allows to extend the capability of pre-trained models with improved performance as well as robustness to bridge synthetic pre-training and real-world fine-tuning. Our CoLoRA with PROD has demonstrated its superior performance in various image restoration tasks across diverse degradation types on both synthetic and real-world datasets for known and novel tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 15 figures, for homepage see this url : https://janeyeon.github.io/colora/</p></details> |

This is worsened by lack of ground truth data of clean scenes without water. Diffusion priors have emerged as strong image restoration priors. However, they are often trained with a dataset of the desired restored output, which is not available in our case. We also observe that using only color data is insufficient, and therefore augment the prior with a depth channel. We train an unconditional diffusion model prior on the joint space of color and depth, using standard RGBD datasets of natural outdoor scenes in air. Using this prior together with a novel guidance method based on the underwater image formation model, we generate posterior samples of clean images, removing the water effects. Even though our prior did not see any underwater images during training, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for image restoration on very challenging scenes. Our code, models and data are available on the project website.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

Currently, little existing literature offers a solution to this problem. In response, we propose a prior embedding-driven architecture for long distance blind iris recognition. We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restore-RWKV: Efficient and Effective Medical Image Restoration with RWKV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11087v2)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized medical image restoration, but the quadratic complexity still poses limitations for their application to high-resolution medical images. The recent advent of RWKV in the NLP field has attracted much attention as it can process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range.

Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Multi-Expert Adaptive Selection: Task-Balancing for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19139v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of a single image restoration framework to achieve multi-task image restoration has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, several practical challenges remain, including meeting the specific and simultaneous demands of different tasks, balancing relationships between tasks, and effectively utilizing task correlations in model design. To address these challenges, this paper explores a multi-expert adaptive selection mechanism. We begin by designing a feature representation method that accounts for both the pixel channel level and the global level, encompassing low-frequency and high-frequency components of the image. Based on this method, we construct a multi-expert selection and ensemble scheme. This scheme adaptively selects the most suitable expert from the expert library according to the content of the input image and the prompts of the current task. It not only meets the individualized needs of different tasks but also achieves balance and optimization across tasks. By sharing experts, our design promotes interconnections between different tasks, thereby enhancing overall performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the multi-expert mechanism effectively eliminates irrelevant experts, reducing interference from them and further improving the effectiveness and accuracy of image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is both effective and superior to existing approaches, highlighting its potential for practical applications in multi-task image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilated Strip Attention Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18613v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a long-standing task that seeks to recover the latent sharp image from its deteriorated counterpart. Due to the robust capacity of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods or some attention-based convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results on many image restoration tasks in recent years. However, existing attention modules encounters limited receptive fields or abundant parameters. In order to integrate contextual information more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose a dilated strip attention network (DSAN) for image restoration. Specifically, to gather more contextual information for each pixel from its neighboring pixels in the same row or column, a dilated strip attention (DSA) mechanism is elaborately proposed. By employing the DSA operation horizontally and vertically, each location can harvest the contextual information from a much wider region. In addition, we utilize multi-scale receptive fields across different feature groups in DSA to improve representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our DSAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions via Histogram Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10172v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10MB</p></details> |

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art inpainting methods are mainly designed for nature images and cannot correctly recover text within scene text images, and training existing models on the scene text images cannot fix the issues. In this work, we identify the visual-text inpainting task to achieve high-quality scene text image restoration and text completion: Given a scene text image with unknown missing regions and the corresponding text with unknown missing characters, we aim to complete the missing information in both images and text by leveraging their complementary information. Intuitively, the input text, even if damaged, contains language priors of the contents within the images and can guide the image inpainting. Meanwhile, the scene text image includes the appearance cues of the characters that could benefit text recovery. To this end, we design the cross-modal predictive interaction (CLII) model containing two branches, i.e., ImgBranch and TxtBranch, for scene text inpainting and text completion, respectively while leveraging their complementary effectively. Moreover, we propose to embed our model into the SOTA scene text spotting method and significantly enhance its robustness against missing pixels, which demonstrates the practicality of the newly developed task. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct three real datasets based on existing text-related datasets, containing 1838 images and covering three scenarios with curved, incidental, and styled texts, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms baselines significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Prior-Based Amortized Variational Inference for Noisy Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16125v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on inverse problems have proposed posterior samplers that leverage the pre-trained diffusion models as powerful priors. These attempts have paved the way for using diffusion models in a wide range of inverse problems. However, the existing methods entail computationally demanding iterative sampling procedures and optimize a separate solution for each measurement, which leads to limited scalability and lack of generalization capability across unseen samples. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion prior-based Amortized Variational Inference (DAVI) that solves inverse problems with a diffusion prior from an amortized variational inference perspective. Specifically, instead of separate measurement-wise optimization, our amortized inference learns a function that directly maps measurements to the implicit posterior distributions of corresponding clean data, enabling a single-step posterior sampling even for unseen measurements. Extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, e.g., Gaussian deblur, 4$\times$ super-resolution, and box inpainting with two benchmark datasets, demonstrate our approach's superior performance over strong baselines.

Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffLoss: unleashing diffusion model as constraint for training image restoration network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to enhance low quality images, producing high quality images that exhibit natural visual characteristics and fine semantic attributes. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful technique for image generation, and it has been explicitly employed as a backbone in image restoration tasks, yielding excellent results. However, it suffers from the drawbacks of slow inference speed and large model parameters due to its intrinsic characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that implicitly leverages the diffusion model to assist the training of image restoration network, called DiffLoss, which drives the restoration results to be optimized for naturalness and semantic-aware visual effect. To achieve this, we utilize the mode coverage capability of the diffusion model to approximate the distribution of natural images and explore its ability to capture image semantic attributes. On the one hand, we extract intermediate noise to leverage its modeling capability of the distribution of natural images, which serves as a naturalness-oriented optimization space. On the other hand, we utilize the bottleneck features of diffusion model to harness its semantic attributes serving as a constraint on semantic level. By combining these two designs, the overall loss function is able to improve the perceptual quality of image restoration, resulting in visually pleasing and semantically enhanced outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the visual quality and semantic perception of the restoration network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

However, existing models often require specific learning modules tailored for each degradation, resulting in complex architectures and high computation costs. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose a unified manner to achieve joint embedding by leveraging the inherent similarities across various degradations for efficient and comprehensive restoration. Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs.

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration.

To address this limitation, we propose Grouped Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity (GRIDS), a novel approach that harmonizes the competing objectives inherent in multiple-degradation restoration. We first introduce a quantitative method for assessing relationships between image degradations using statistical modeling of deep degradation representations. This analysis facilitates the strategic grouping of similar tasks, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of the restoration process. Based on the degradation similarity, GRIDS divides restoration tasks into one of the optimal groups, where tasks within the same group are highly correlated. For instance, GRIDS effectively groups 11 degradation types into 4 cohesive groups. Trained models within each group show significant improvements, with an average improvement of 0.09dB over single-task upper bound models and 2.24dB over the mix-training baseline model. GRIDS incorporates an adaptive model selection mechanism for inference, automatically selecting the appropriate grouped-training model based on the input degradation. This mechanism is particularly useful for real-world scenarios with unknown degradations as it does not rely on explicit degradation classification modules. Furthermore, our method can predict model generalization ability without the need for network inference, providing valuable insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks. Based on this principle, we design a new general image restoration backbone network, X-Restormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Restormer possesses good task generality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to ECCV2024 |

Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, it still remains an open research problem to adopt this language-vision paradigm for more fine-level image processing tasks, such as denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and compression artifact removal. In this paper, we develop SPIRE, a Semantic and restoration Prompt-driven Image Restoration framework that leverages natural language as a user-friendly interface to control the image restoration process. We consider the capacity of prompt information in two dimensions. First, we use content-related prompts to enhance the semantic alignment, effectively alleviating identity ambiguity in the restoration outcomes. Second, our approach is the first framework that supports fine-level instruction through language-based quantitative specification of the restoration strength, without the need for explicit task-specific design. In addition, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that augments the existing ControlNet architecture by learning to rescale the generative prior, thereby achieving better restoration fidelity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior restoration performance of SPIRE compared to the state of the arts, alongside offering the flexibility of text-based control over the restoration effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024; Webpage: https://chenyangqiqi.github.io/tip</p></details> |

Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model.

This intends to handle two pivotal challenges in the existing CIR methods: (i) lacking adaptability and universality for different image codecs, e.g., JPEG and WebP; (ii) poor texture generation capability, particularly at low bitrates. Specifically, our MoE-DiffIR develops the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) prompt module, where some basic prompts cooperate to excavate the task-customized diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion (SD) for each compression task. Moreover, the degradation-aware routing mechanism is proposed to enable the flexible assignment of basic prompts. To activate and reuse the cross-modality generation prior of SD, we design the visual-to-text adapter for MoE-DiffIR, which aims to adapt the embedding of low-quality images from the visual domain to the textual domain as the textual guidance for SD, enabling more consistent and reasonable texture generation. We also construct one comprehensive benchmark dataset for universal CIR, covering 21 types of degradations from 7 popular traditional and learned codecs.

Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets. All the source code will be made available to the public.</p></details> |  |

Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world Video Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00853v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions. To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.20106</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |

To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the potential risk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might directly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side.

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2024</p></details> |

Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. Further, we propose to maneuver Instruct-IPT with text instructions for better user interfaces. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |
| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIR: A Lightweight Baseline for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01368v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in Image Restoration based on CNN and transformer. However, the inherent characteristics of the Image Restoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to focus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model, leading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the efficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently restore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious structural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and global residual connections that are ignored by modern networks. Then, a Lightweight Adaptive Attention (LAA) Block is introduced which is mainly composed of proposed Adaptive Filters and Attention Blocks. The proposed Adaptive Filter is used to adaptively extract high-frequency information and enhance object contours in various IR tasks, and Attention Block involves a novel Patch Attention module to approximate the self-attention part of the transformer. On the deraining task, our LIR achieves the state-of-the-art Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). For denoising, dehazing, and deblurring tasks, LIR also achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with a parameter size of about 30\%. In addition, it is worth noting that our LIR produces better visual results that are more in line with the human aesthetic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-High-Definition Restoration: New Benchmarks and A Dual Interaction Prior-Driven Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13607v2)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration has acquired remarkable attention due to its practical demand. In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

| **[Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08853v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining \& dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration.

| **[Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Restorer: Solving Multiple Image Restoration Tasks with One Set of Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth.

Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Test-Time Degradation Adaptation for Open-Set Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02197v4)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contrast to close-set scenarios that restore images from a predefined set of degradations, open-set image restoration aims to handle the unknown degradations that were unforeseen during the pretraining phase, which is less-touched as far as we know. This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |
| **[Deep Block Proximal Linearised Minimisation Algorithm for Non-convex Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02458v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is typically addressed through non-convex inverse problems, which are often solved using first-order block-wise splitting methods. In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |
| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

| **[Efficient Degradation-aware Any Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15475v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing missing details from degraded low-quality inputs poses a significant challenge. Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/BracketIRE.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

However, the substantial volume of data associated with point clouds presents numerous challenges, particularly in terms of high bandwidth consumption and large storage capacity. Despite various solutions proposed thus far, with a focus on point cloud compression, upsampling, and completion, these reconstruction-related methods continue to fall short in delivering high fidelity point cloud output. As a solution, in DiffPMAE, we propose an effective point cloud reconstruction architecture. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we combine Masked Auto-Encoding and Diffusion Model mechanism to remotely reconstruct point cloud data. By the nature of this reconstruction process, DiffPMAE can be extended to many related downstream tasks including point cloud compression, upsampling and completion. Leveraging ShapeNet-55 and ModelNet datasets with over 60000 objects, we validate the performance of DiffPMAE exceeding many state-of-the-art methods in-terms of auto-encoding and downstream tasks considered.</p></details> |  |

While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

We begin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through controlled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively recreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key insight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is familiar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in the model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual inversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens required for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal definitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce original content without relying on specific prompts or having the training data of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable diffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the number of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the understanding of originality in generative models and has implications for copyright infringement cases.</p></details> | GenLaw ICML 2024 |
| **[Implicit and Explicit Language Guidance for Diffusion-based Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07600v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown powerful ability on conditional image synthesis. With large-scale vision-language pre-training, diffusion models are able to generate high-quality images with rich texture and reasonable structure under different text prompts. However, it is an open problem to adapt the pre-trained diffusion model for visual perception. In this paper, we propose an implicit and explicit language guidance framework for diffusion-based perception, named IEDP. Our IEDP comprises an implicit language guidance branch and an explicit language guidance branch. The implicit branch employs frozen CLIP image encoder to directly generate implicit text embeddings that are fed to diffusion model, without using explicit text prompts. The explicit branch utilizes the ground-truth labels of corresponding images as text prompts to condition feature extraction of diffusion model. During training, we jointly train diffusion model by sharing the model weights of these two branches. As a result, implicit and explicit branches can jointly guide feature learning. During inference, we only employ implicit branch for final prediction, which does not require any ground-truth labels. Experiments are performed on two typical perception tasks, including semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Our IEDP achieves promising performance on both tasks. For semantic segmentation, our IEDP has the mIoU$^\text{ss}$ score of 55.9% on AD20K validation set, which outperforms the baseline method VPD by 2.2%. For depth estimation, our IEDP outperforms the baseline method VPD with a relative gain of 11.0%.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMM |

The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</p></details> |  |

However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Active Generation for Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06517v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.

| **[EmoDM: A Diffusion Model for Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15931v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary algorithms have been successful in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). However, as a class of population-based search methodology, evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, preventing them from being applied to a wide range of expensive MOPs. To tackle the above challenge, this work proposes for the first time a diffusion model that can learn to perform evolutionary multi-objective search, called EmoDM. This is achieved by treating the reversed convergence process of evolutionary search as the forward diffusion and learn the noise distributions from previously solved evolutionary optimization tasks. The pre-trained EmoDM can then generate a set of non-dominated solutions for a new MOP by means of its reverse diffusion without further evolutionary search, thereby significantly reducing the required function evaluations. To enhance the scalability of EmoDM, a mutual entropy-based attention mechanism is introduced to capture the decision variables that are most important for the objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness of EmoDM in terms of both the search performance and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in solving MOPs having up to 5000 decision variables. The pre-trained EmoDM is shown to generalize well to unseen problems, revealing its strong potential as a general and efficient MOP solver.</p></details> |  |

To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>contr...</summary><p>controllable generation</p></details> |

However, these methods ignore the modal gap between the 2D diffusion model and 3D objects, which primarily render 3D objects into 2D images and texture each image separately. In this paper, we revisit the texture synthesis and propose a Variance alignment based 3D-2D Collaborative Denoising framework, dubbed VCD-Texture, to address these issues. Formally, we first unify both 2D and 3D latent feature learning in diffusion self-attention modules with re-projected 3D attention receptive fields. Subsequently, the denoised multi-view 2D latent features are aggregated into 3D space and then rasterized back to formulate more consistent 2D predictions. However, the rasterization process suffers from an intractable variance bias, which is theoretically addressed by the proposed variance alignment, achieving high-fidelity texture synthesis. Moreover, we present an inpainting refinement to further improve the details with conflicting regions. Notably, there is not a publicly available benchmark to evaluate texture synthesis, which hinders its development. Thus we construct a new evaluation set built upon three open-source 3D datasets and propose to use four metrics to thoroughly validate the texturing performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that VCD-Texture achieves superior performance against other counterparts.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

HawkI uses techniques from classical computer vision and information theory. It seamlessly blends the visual features from the input image within a pretrained text-to-2Dimage stable diffusion model with a test-time optimization process for a careful bias-variance trade-off, which uses an Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) homography transformation to provide subtle cues for aerialview synthesis. At inference, HawkI employs a unique mutual information guidance formulation to steer the generated image towards faithfully replicating the semantic details of the input-image, while maintaining a realistic aerial perspective. Mutual information guidance maximizes the semantic consistency between the generated image and the input image, without enforcing pixel-level correspondence between vastly different viewpoints. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against text + exemplar-image based methods and 3D/ multi-view based novel-view synthesis methods on proposed synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves a significantly better bias-variance trade-off towards generating high fidelity aerial-view images.Code and data is available at https://github.com/divyakraman/HawkI2024.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2024</p></details> |

One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research.

In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging systems for improved reconstruction results.</p></details> |  |

Despite the widespread application demand in editing human-centered videos, these models face significant challenges in handling complex objects like humans. In this paper, we introduce DeCo, a novel video editing framework specifically designed to treat humans and the background as separate editable targets, ensuring global spatial-temporal consistency by maintaining the coherence of each individual component. Specifically, we propose a decoupled dynamic human representation that utilizes a parametric human body prior to generate tailored humans while preserving the consistent motions as the original video. In addition, we consider the background as a layered atlas to apply text-guided image editing approaches on it. To further enhance the geometry and texture of humans during the optimization, we extend the calculation of score distillation sampling into normal space and image space. Moreover, we tackle inconsistent lighting between the edited targets by leveraging a lighting-aware video harmonizer, a problem previously overlooked in decompose-edit-combine approaches. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate that DeCo outperforms prior video editing methods in human-centered videos, especially in longer videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Computer Vision</p></details> |

However, these approaches typically require tens or even hundreds of iterative samplings, resulting in significant latency. Recently, techniques have been devised to enhance the sampling efficiency of diffusion-based SR models via knowledge distillation. Nonetheless, when aligning the knowledge of student and teacher models, these solutions either solely rely on pixel-level loss constraints or neglect the fact that diffusion models prioritize varying levels of information at different time steps. To accomplish effective and efficient image super-resolution, we propose a time-aware diffusion distillation method, named TAD-SR. Specifically, we introduce a novel score distillation strategy to align the data distribution between the outputs of the student and teacher models after minor noise perturbation. This distillation strategy enables the student network to concentrate more on the high-frequency details. Furthermore, to mitigate performance limitations stemming from distillation, we integrate a latent adversarial loss and devise a time-aware discriminator that leverages diffusion priors to effectively distinguish between real images and generated images. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to both previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and the teacher model in just one sampling step.

The algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband. Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out, as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the room impulse response is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental results and insights into the algorithm's performance and versatility. We first investigate the robustness of informed dereverberation methods to RIR estimation errors, to motivate the joint acoustic estimation and dereverberation paradigm. Then, we demonstrate the adaptability of our method to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, study its performance in RIR estimation, and conduct subjective evaluation experiments to validate the perceptual quality of the results, among other contributions. Audio samples and code can be found online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |
| **[KIND: Knowledge Integration and Diversion in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07337v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models have become the preferred backbone due to the expansion of model parameters, with techniques like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFTs) typically fixing the parameters of these models. However, pre-trained models may not always be optimal, especially when there are discrepancies between training tasks and target tasks, potentially resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we introduce \textbf{KIND}, which performs \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{IN}tegration and \textbf{D}iversion in diffusion models. KIND first integrates knowledge by decomposing parameter matrices of models using $U$, $\Sigma$, and $V$ matrices, formally inspired by singular value decomposition (SVD). Then it explicitly partitions the components of these matrices into \textbf{learngenes} and \textbf{tailors} to condense common and class-specific knowledge, respectively, through a class gate. In this way, KIND redefines traditional pre-training methods by adjusting training objectives from maximizing model performance on current tasks to condensing transferable common knowledge, leveraging the \textit{Learngene} framework. We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K and compare KIND with PEFT and other learngene methods. Results indicate that KIND achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other PEFT and learngene methods. Specifically, the images generated by KIND achieves more than 6.54 and 1.07 decrease in FID and sFID on DiT-L/2, utilizing only 45.4M trainable parameters and saving at least 35.4G FLOPs in computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cascaded Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model for Medical Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12223v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-image translation is a vital component in medical imaging processing, with many uses in a wide range of imaging modalities and clinical scenarios. Previous methods include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), which offer realism but suffer from instability and lack uncertainty estimation. Even though both GAN and DM methods have individually exhibited their capability in medical image translation tasks, the potential of combining a GAN and DM to further improve translation performance and to enable uncertainty estimation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a Cascade Multi-path Shortcut Diffusion Model (CMDM) for high-quality medical image translation and uncertainty estimation. To reduce the required number of iterations and ensure robust performance, our method first obtains a conditional GAN-generated prior image that will be used for the efficient reverse translation with a DM in the subsequent step. Additionally, a multi-path shortcut diffusion strategy is employed to refine translation results and estimate uncertainty. A cascaded pipeline further enhances translation quality, incorporating residual averaging between cascades. We collected three different medical image datasets with two sub-tasks for each dataset to test the generalizability of our approach. Our experimental results found that CMDM can produce high-quality translations comparable to state-of-the-art methods while providing reasonable uncertainty estimations that correlate well with the translation error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis Journal</p></details> |

The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility, catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based method, termed \ourmethod, to generate fonts that vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of \ourmethod lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset, affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements.

Recently, the combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with latent diffusion models (LDMs) has emerged as a viable approach for efficiently adapting pre-trained large language models, in the medical field. However, the direct application of LoRA assumes uniform ranking across all linear layers, overlooking the significance of different weight matrices, and leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Prior works on LoRA prioritize the reduction of trainable parameters, and there exists an opportunity to further tailor this adaptation process to the intricate demands of medical image synthesis. In response, we present SeLoRA, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation Module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training, strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers, to allow the model to elevate synthesis quality where it matters most. The proposed method not only enables LDMs to fine-tune on medical data efficiently but also empowers the model to achieve improved image quality with minimal ranking. The code of our SeLoRA method is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SeLoRA-980D .</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yuchen20.github.io/SeLoRA.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Low-Bitwidth Floating Point Quantization for Efficient High-Quality Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06995v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are emerging models that generate images by iteratively denoising random Gaussian noise using deep neural networks. These models typically exhibit high computational and memory demands, necessitating effective post-training quantization for high-performance inference. Recent works propose low-bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit) quantization for diffusion models, however 4-bit integer quantization typically results in low-quality images. We observe that on several widely used hardware platforms, there is little or no difference in compute capability between floating-point and integer arithmetic operations of the same bitwidth (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit). Therefore, we propose an effective floating-point quantization method for diffusion models that provides better image quality compared to integer quantization methods. We employ a floating-point quantization method that was effective for other processing tasks, specifically computer vision and natural language tasks, and tailor it for diffusion models by integrating weight rounding learning during the mapping of the full-precision values to the quantized values in the quantization process. We comprehensively study integer and floating-point quantization methods in state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our floating-point quantization method not only generates higher-quality images than that of integer quantization methods, but also shows no noticeable degradation compared to full-precision models (32-bit floating-point), when both weights and activations are quantized to 8-bit floating-point values, while has minimal degradation with 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations.</p></details> |  |

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) are the main frameworks used to create Deepfakes, producing highly realistic yet fabricated content. While these technologies open up new creative possibilities, they also bring substantial ethical and security risks due to their potential misuse. The rise of such advanced media has led to the development of a cognitive bias known as Impostor Bias, where individuals doubt the authenticity of multimedia due to the awareness of AI's capabilities. As a result, Deepfake detection has become a vital area of research, focusing on identifying subtle inconsistencies and artifacts with machine learning techniques, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Research in forensic Deepfake technology encompasses five main areas: detection, attribution and recognition, passive authentication, detection in realistic scenarios, and active authentication. This paper reviews the primary algorithms that address these challenges, examining their advantages, limitations, and future prospects.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Ensemble Score Filter for Tracking High-Dimensional Nonlinear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00983v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an ensemble score filter (EnSF) for solving high-dimensional nonlinear filtering problems with superior accuracy. A major drawback of existing filtering methods, e.g., particle filters or ensemble Kalman filters, is the low accuracy in handling high-dimensional and highly nonlinear problems. EnSF attacks this challenge by exploiting the score-based diffusion model, defined in a pseudo-temporal domain, to characterizing the evolution of the filtering density. EnSF stores the information of the recursively updated filtering density function in the score function, instead of storing the information in a set of finite Monte Carlo samples (used in particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters). Unlike existing diffusion models that train neural networks to approximate the score function, we develop a training-free score estimation that uses a mini-batch-based Monte Carlo estimator to directly approximate the score function at any pseudo-spatial-temporal location, which provides sufficient accuracy in solving high-dimensional nonlinear problems as well as saves a tremendous amount of time spent on training neural networks. High-dimensional Lorenz-96 systems are used to demonstrate the performance of our method. EnSF provides surprising performance, compared with the state-of-the-art Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter method, in reliably and efficiently tracking extremely high-dimensional Lorenz systems (up to 1,000,000 dimensions) with highly nonlinear observation processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.09282</p></details> |

A significant challenge with slate recommendation is managing the complex combinatorial choice space. Traditional methods often simplify this problem by assuming users engage with only one item at a time. However, this simplification does not reflect the reality, as users often interact with multiple items simultaneously. In this paper, we address the general slate recommendation problem, which accounts for simultaneous engagement with multiple items. We propose a generative approach using Diffusion Models, leveraging their ability to learn structures in high-dimensional data. Our model generates high-quality slates that maximize user satisfaction by overcoming the challenges of the combinatorial choice space. Furthermore, our approach enhances the diversity of recommendations. Extensive offline evaluations on applications such as music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle recommendations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both relevance and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose CLIP4Sketch, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate a large and diverse set of sketch images, which helps in enhancing the performance of face recognition systems in sketch-to-mugshot matching. Our method utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate sketches with explicit control over identity and style. We combine CLIP and Adaface embeddings of a reference mugshot, along with textual descriptions of style, as the conditions to the diffusion model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a comprehensive dataset of sketches corresponding to mugshots and training a face recognition model on our synthetic data. Our results show significant improvements in sketch-to-mugshot matching accuracy over training on an existing, limited amount of real face sketch data, validating the potential of diffusion models in enhancing the performance of face recognition systems across modalities. We also compare our dataset with datasets generated using GAN-based methods to show its superiority.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically involve test-time fine-tuning or instead incorporating an additional pre-trained branch. However, these approaches struggle to simultaneously address the demands of efficiency, identity fidelity, and preserving the model's original generative capabilities. In this paper, we propose DiffLoRA, a novel approach that leverages diffusion models as a hypernetwork to predict personalized low-rank adaptation (LoRA) weights based on the reference images. By integrating these LoRA weights into the text-to-image model, DiffLoRA achieves personalization during inference without further training. Additionally, we propose an identity-oriented LoRA weight construction pipeline to facilitate the training of DiffLoRA. By utilizing the dataset produced by this pipeline, our DiffLoRA consistently generates high-performance and accurate LoRA weights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving both time efficiency and maintaining identity fidelity throughout the personalization process.</p></details> | 9 pages,8 figures |

However, their use in the communication community has been mostly limited to auxiliary tasks like data modeling and feature extraction. These models hold greater promise for fundamental problems in network optimization compared to traditional machine learning methods. Discriminative deep learning often falls short due to its single-step input-output mapping and lack of global awareness of the solution space, especially given the complexity of network optimization's objective functions. In contrast, diffusion generative models can consider a broader range of solutions and exhibit stronger generalization by learning parameters that describe the distribution of the underlying solution space, with higher probabilities assigned to better solutions. We propose a new framework Diffusion Model-based Solution Generation (DiffSG), which leverages the intrinsic distribution learning capabilities of diffusion generative models to learn high-quality solution distributions based on given inputs. The optimal solution within this distribution is highly probable, allowing it to be effectively reached through repeated sampling. We validate the performance of DiffSG on several typical network optimization problems, including mixed-integer non-linear programming, convex optimization, and hierarchical non-convex optimization. Our results show that DiffSG outperforms existing baselines. In summary, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion generative models in tackling complex network optimization problems and outline a promising path for their broader application in the communication community.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, such attempts face the pivotal challenge of misalignment between the intended precise editing target regions and the broader area impacted by the guidance in practice. Despite excellent methods leveraging attention mechanisms that have been developed to refine the editing guidance, these approaches necessitate modifications through complex network architecture and are limited to specific editing tasks. In this work, we re-examine the diffusion process and misalignment problem from a frequency perspective, revealing that, due to the power law of natural images and the decaying noise schedule, the denoising network primarily recovers low-frequency image components during the earlier timesteps and thus brings excessive low-frequency signals for editing. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel fine-tuning free approach that employs progressive $\textbf{Fre}$qu$\textbf{e}$ncy truncation to refine the guidance of $\textbf{Diff}$usion models for universal editing tasks ($\textbf{FreeDiff}$). Our method achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods across a variety of editing tasks and on a diverse set of images, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool in image editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV-2024</p></details> |

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach for time series generation, emphasizing diverse synthesis scenarios based on historical or correlated time series data streams. Since time series have unique characteristics, such as fixed time order and data scaling, standard Gaussian prior might be ill-suited for general time series generation. In this paper, we exploit the usage of diverse prior distributions for synthesis. Then, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that enables flexible synthesis by leveraging diffusion bridges to learn the transport between chosen prior and data distributions. Our model covers a wide range of scenarios in time series diffusion models, which leverages (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional synthesis, and (ii) data-scale preserving synthesis with a constraint as a prior for conditional generation. Experimentally, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both unconditional and conditional time series generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their broad application is impeded by their large model sizes and intensive computational requirements, which typically require expensive cloud servers for deployment. On the flip side, while there are many compact models tailored for edge devices that can reduce these demands, they often compromise on semantic integrity and visual quality when compared to full-sized SDMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hybrid SD, an innovative, training-free SDMs inference framework designed for edge-cloud collaborative inference. Hybrid SD distributes the early steps of the diffusion process to the large models deployed on cloud servers, enhancing semantic planning. Furthermore, small efficient models deployed on edge devices can be integrated for refining visual details in the later stages. Acknowledging the diversity of edge devices with differing computational and storage capacities, we employ structural pruning to the SDMs U-Net and train a lightweight VAE.

To scale up the training data for the diffusion model, a lightweight network is developed to efficiently acquire feature volumes from multi-view images. The 3D volumes are then trained on a diffusion model for text-to-3D generation using a 3D U-Net. This research further addresses the challenges of inaccurate object captions and high-dimensional feature volumes. The proposed model, trained on the public Objaverse dataset, demonstrates promising outcomes in producing diverse and recognizable samples from text prompts. Notably, it empowers finer control over object part characteristics through textual cues, fostering model creativity by seamlessly combining multiple concepts within a single object. This research significantly contributes to the progress of 3D generation by introducing an efficient, flexible, and scalable representation methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViMo: Generating Motions from Casual Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06614v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although humans have the innate ability to imagine multiple possible actions from videos, it remains an extraordinary challenge for computers due to the intricate camera movements and montages. Most existing motion generation methods predominantly rely on manually collected motion datasets, usually tediously sourced from motion capture (Mocap) systems or Multi-View cameras, unavoidably resulting in a limited size that severely undermines their generalizability. Inspired by recent advance of diffusion models, we probe a simple and effective way to capture motions from videos and propose a novel Video-to-Motion-Generation framework (ViMo) which could leverage the immense trove of untapped video content to produce abundant and diverse 3D human motions. Distinct from prior work, our videos could be more causal, including complicated camera movements and occlusions. Striking experimental results demonstrate the proposed model could generate natural motions even for videos where rapid movements, varying perspectives, or frequent occlusions might exist. We also show this work could enable three important downstream applications, such as generating dancing motions according to arbitrary music and source video style. Extensive experimental results prove that our model offers an effective and scalable way to generate diversity and realistic motions. Code and demos will be public soon.</p></details> |  |

PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the PeRFlow models inherit knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Thus, the training converges fast and the obtained models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models. Codes for training and inference are publicly released. https://github.com/magic-research/piecewise-rectified-flow</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Discrete Diffusion for Categorical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03701v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have seen a surge of attention with applications on naturally discrete data such as language and graphs. Although discrete-time discrete diffusion has been established for a while, only recently Campbell et al. (2022) introduced the first framework for continuous-time discrete diffusion. However, their training and sampling processes differ significantly from the discrete-time version, necessitating nontrivial approximations for tractability. In this paper, we first present a series of mathematical simplifications of the variational lower bound that enable more accurate and easy-to-optimize training for discrete diffusion. In addition, we derive a simple formulation for backward denoising that enables exact and accelerated sampling, and importantly, an elegant unification of discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion. Thanks to simpler analytical formulations, both forward and now also backward probabilities can flexibly accommodate any noise distribution, including different noise distributions for multi-element objects. Experiments show that our proposed USD3 (for Unified Simplified Discrete Denoising Diffusion) outperform all SOTA baselines on established datasets. We open-source our unified code at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/USD3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unify...</summary><p>Unify Discrete Denoising Diffusion</p></details> |
| **[3D Reconstruction of Protein Structures from Multi-view AFM Images using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06244v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning for predicting 3D protein structures have shown promise, particularly when leveraging inputs like protein sequences and Cryo-Electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) images. However, these techniques often fall short when predicting the structures of protein complexes (PCs), which involve multiple proteins. In our study, we investigate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined with deep learning to predict the 3D structures of PCs. AFM generates height maps that depict the PCs in various random orientations, providing a rich information for training a neural network to predict the 3D structures. We then employ the pre-trained UpFusion model (which utilizes a conditional diffusion model for synthesizing novel views) to train an instance-specific NeRF model for 3D reconstruction. The performance of UpFusion is evaluated through zero-shot predictions of 3D protein structures using AFM images. The challenge, however, lies in the time-intensive and impractical nature of collecting actual AFM images. To address this, we use a virtual AFM imaging process that transforms a `PDB' protein file into multi-view 2D virtual AFM images via volume rendering techniques. We extensively validate the UpFusion architecture using both virtual and actual multi-view AFM images. Our results include a comparison of structures predicted with varying numbers of views and different sets of views. This novel approach holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of protein complex structure predictions with further fine-tuning of the UpFusion network.</p></details> |  |
| **[ControlNet-XS: Rethinking the Control of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models as Feedback-Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06573v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of image synthesis has made tremendous strides forward in the last years. Besides defining the desired output image with text-prompts, an intuitive approach is to additionally use spatial guidance in form of an image, such as a depth map. In state-of-the-art approaches, this guidance is realized by a separate controlling model that controls a pre-trained image generation network, such as a latent diffusion model. Understanding this process from a control system perspective shows that it forms a feedback-control system, where the control module receives a feedback signal from the generation process and sends a corrective signal back. When analysing existing systems, we observe that the feedback signals are timely sparse and have a small number of bits. As a consequence, there can be long delays between newly generated features and the respective corrective signals for these features. It is known that this delay is the most unwanted aspect of any control system. In this work, we take an existing controlling network (ControlNet) and change the communication between the controlling network and the generation process to be of high-frequency and with large-bandwidth. By doing so, we are able to considerably improve the quality of the generated images, as well as the fidelity of the control. Also, the controlling network needs noticeably fewer parameters and hence is about twice as fast during inference and training time. Another benefit of small-sized models is that they help to democratise our field and are likely easier to understand. We call our proposed network ControlNet-XS. When comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches, we outperform them for pixel-level guidance, such as depth, canny-edges, and semantic segmentation, and are on a par for loose keypoint-guidance of human poses. All code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LPGen: Enhancing High-Fidelity Landscape Painting Generation through Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17229v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating landscape paintings expands the possibilities of artistic creativity and imagination. Traditional landscape painting methods involve using ink or colored ink on rice paper, which requires substantial time and effort. These methods are susceptible to errors and inconsistencies and lack precise control over lines and colors. This paper presents LPGen, a high-fidelity, controllable model for landscape painting generation, introducing a novel multi-modal framework that integrates image prompts into the diffusion model. We extract its edges and contours by computing canny edges from the target landscape image. These, along with natural language text prompts and drawing style references, are fed into the latent diffusion model as conditions. We implement a decoupled cross-attention strategy to ensure compatibility between image and text prompts, facilitating multi-modal image generation. A decoder generates the final image. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in landscape painting generation and exceeds the current state-of-the-art. The LPGen network effectively controls the composition and color of landscape paintings, generates more accurate images, and supports further research in deep learning-based landscape painting generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Novel View Synthesis from a Single Image with Pretrained Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06157v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are limited to single-object-centric scenes generated from new viewpoints and struggle with complex environments. They often require extensive 3D data for training, lacking generalization beyond training distribution. Conversely, 3D-free methods can generate text-controlled views of complex, in-the-wild scenes using a pretrained stable diffusion model without tedious fine-tuning, but lack camera control. In this paper, we introduce HawkI++, a method capable of generating camera-controlled viewpoints from a single input image. HawkI++ excels in handling complex and diverse scenes without additional 3D data or extensive training. It leverages widely available pretrained NVS models for weak guidance, integrating this knowledge into a 3D-free view synthesis approach to achieve the desired results efficiently. Our experimental results demonstrate that HawkI++ outperforms existing models in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, providing high-fidelity and consistent novel view synthesis at desired camera angles across a wide variety of scenes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Our network employs a dual-branch architecture, combining the high-resolution representations of points with the computational efficiency of sparse voxels. Our fastest variant outperforms all non-diffusion generative approaches on unconditional shape generation, the most popular benchmark for evaluating point cloud generative models, while our largest model achieves state-of-the-art results among diffusion methods, with a runtime approximately 70% of the previously state-of-the-art PVD. Beyond unconditional generation, we perform extensive evaluations, including conditional generation on all categories of ShapeNet, demonstrating the scalability of our model to larger datasets, and implicit generation which allows our network to produce high quality point clouds on fewer timesteps, further decreasing the generation time. Finally, we evaluate the architecture's performance in point cloud completion and super-resolution. Our model excels in all tasks, establishing it as a state-of-the-art diffusion U-Net for point cloud generative modeling.

| **[Towards Highly Realistic Artistic Style Transfer via Stable Diffusion with Step-aware and Layer-aware Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11474v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the learned artistic style onto an arbitrary content image, generating artistic stylized images. Existing generative adversarial network-based methods fail to generate highly realistic stylized images and always introduce obvious artifacts and disharmonious patterns. Recently, large-scale pre-trained diffusion models opened up a new way for generating highly realistic artistic stylized images. However, diffusion model-based methods generally fail to preserve the content structure of input content images well, introducing some undesired content structure and style patterns. To address the above problems, we propose a novel pre-trained diffusion-based artistic style transfer method, called LSAST, which can generate highly realistic artistic stylized images while preserving the content structure of input content images well, without bringing obvious artifacts and disharmonious style patterns. Specifically, we introduce a Step-aware and Layer-aware Prompt Space, a set of learnable prompts, which can learn the style information from the collection of artworks and dynamically adjusts the input images' content structure and style pattern. To train our prompt space, we propose a novel inversion method, called Step-ware and Layer-aware Prompt Inversion, which allows the prompt space to learn the style information of the artworks collection. In addition, we inject a pre-trained conditional branch of ControlNet into our LSAST, which further improved our framework's ability to maintain content structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can generate more highly realistic artistic stylized images than the state-of-the-art artistic style transfer methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2024</p></details> |

To efficently model video data, we propose to levearge a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions. To improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. By employing a progressive training technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method. It significantly helps enhance the performance of CogVideoX, improving both generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations.

Existing methods always employ an accurate mask to remove the original garment in the source image, thus achieving realistic synthesized images in simple and conventional try-on scenarios based on powerful diffusion model. Therefore, acquiring suitable mask is vital to the try-on performance of these methods. However, obtaining precise inpainting masks, especially for complex wild try-on data containing diverse foreground occlusions and person poses, is not easy as Figure 1-Top shows. This difficulty often results in poor performance in more practical and challenging real-life scenarios, such as the selfie scene shown in Figure 1-Bottom. To this end, we propose a novel training paradigm combined with an efficient data augmentation method to acquire large-scale unpaired training data from wild scenarios, thereby significantly facilitating the try-on performance of our model without the need for additional inpainting masks. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to localize a more accurate try-on area to obtain more reasonable try-on results. It is noted that our method only needs the reference cloth image, source pose image and source person image as input, which is more cost-effective and user-friendly compared to existing methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.</p></details> |  |

Of particular concern are generated images that resemble photographs as they aspire to represent real world events. Synthetic photographs may be used maliciously by a broad range of threat actors, from scammers to nation-state actors, to deceive, defraud, and mislead people. Mitigating this threat usually involves answering a basic analytic question: Is the photograph real or synthetic? To address this, we have examined the capabilities of recent generative diffusion models and have focused on their flaws: visible artifacts in generated images which reveal their synthetic origin to the trained eye. We categorize these artifacts, provide examples, discuss the challenges in detecting them, suggest practical applications of our work, and outline future research directions.</p></details> | 27 pages, 25 figures |

However, extending these techniques to video generation remains challenging, with existing text-to-video (T2V) methods often struggling to produce high-quality and motion-consistent videos. In this work, we introduce Control-A-Video, a controllable T2V diffusion model that can generate videos conditioned on text prompts and reference control maps like edge and depth maps. To tackle video quality and motion consistency issues, we propose novel strategies to incorporate content prior and motion prior into the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we employ a first-frame condition scheme to transfer video generation from the image domain. Additionally, we introduce residual-based and optical flow-based noise initialization to infuse motion priors from reference videos, promoting relevance among frame latents for reduced flickering. Furthermore, we present a Spatio-Temporal Reward Feedback Learning (ST-ReFL) algorithm that optimizes the video diffusion model using multiple reward models for video quality and motion consistency, leading to superior outputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates higher-quality, more consistent videos compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in controllable text-to-video generation</p></details> |  |

This disparity affects the fairness of artificial intelligence algorithms in healthcare. We introduce Diffuse-UDA, a novel method leveraging diffusion models to tackle Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in medical image segmentation. Diffuse-UDA generates high-quality image-mask pairs with target domain characteristics and various structures, thereby enhancing UDA tasks. Initially, pseudo labels for target domain samples are generated. Subsequently, a specially tailored diffusion model, incorporating deformable augmentations, is trained on image-label or image-pseudo-label pairs from both domains. Finally, source domain labels guide the diffusion model to generate image-label pairs for the target domain. Comprehensive evaluations on several benchmarks demonstrate that Diffuse-UDA outperforms leading UDA and semi-supervised strategies, achieving performance close to or even surpassing the theoretical upper bound of models trained directly on target domain data. Diffuse-UDA offers a pathway to advance the development and deployment of AI systems in medical imaging, addressing disparities between healthcare environments. This approach enables the exploration of innovative AI-driven diagnostic tools, improves outcomes, saves time, and reduces human error.</p></details> |  |

But reliable measurement is fundamentally challenging, and touches on issues of reproducibility, scalability, uncertainty quantification, epistemology, and more. This dissertation addresses criteria needed to take reliability seriously: both criteria for designing meaningful metrics, and for methodologies that ensure that we can dependably and efficiently measure these metrics at scale and in practice. In doing so, this dissertation articulates a research vision for a new field of scholarship at the intersection of machine learning, law, and policy. Within this frame, we cover topics that fit under three different themes: (1) quantifying and mitigating sources of arbitrariness in ML, (2) taming randomness in uncertainty estimation and optimization algorithms, in order to achieve scalability without sacrificing reliability, and (3) providing methods for evaluating generative-AI systems, with specific focuses on quantifying memorization in language models and training latent diffusion models on open-licensed data. By making contributions in these three themes, this dissertation serves as an empirical proof by example that research on reliable measurement for machine learning is intimately and inescapably bound up with research in law and policy. These different disciplines pose similar research questions about reliable measurement in machine learning. They are, in fact, two complementary sides of the same research vision, which, broadly construed, aims to construct machine-learning systems that cohere with broader societal values.</p></details> | Ph.D. Dissertation |

UniPortrait consists of only two plug-and-play modules: an ID embedding module and an ID routing module. The ID embedding module extracts versatile editable facial features with a decoupling strategy for each ID and embeds them into the context space of diffusion models. The ID routing module then combines and distributes these embeddings adaptively to their respective regions within the synthesized image, achieving the customization of single and multiple IDs. With a carefully designed two-stage training scheme, UniPortrait achieves superior performance in both single- and multi-ID customization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches as well as its good scalability, e.g., the universal compatibility with existing generative control tools.

However, the diffusion models used in these techniques are prone to viewpoint bias and thus lead to geometric inconsistencies such as the Janus problem. To counter this, we introduce MT3D, a text-to-3D generative model that leverages a high-fidelity 3D object to overcome viewpoint bias and explicitly infuse geometric understanding into the generation pipeline. Firstly, we employ depth maps derived from a high-quality 3D model as control signals to guarantee that the generated 2D images preserve the fundamental shape and structure, thereby reducing the inherent viewpoint bias. Next, we utilize deep geometric moments to ensure geometric consistency in the 3D representation explicitly. By incorporating geometric details from a 3D asset, MT3D enables the creation of diverse and geometrically consistent objects, thereby improving the quality and usability of our 3D representations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Simple Early Exiting Framework for Accelerated Sampling in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05927v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generation problems over various domains including images, videos, text, and audio. A practical bottleneck of diffusion models is their sampling speed, due to the repeated evaluation of score estimation networks during the inference. In this work, we propose a novel framework capable of adaptively allocating compute required for the score estimation, thereby reducing the overall sampling time of diffusion models. We observe that the amount of computation required for the score estimation may vary along the time step for which the score is estimated. Based on this observation, we propose an early-exiting scheme, where we skip the subset of parameters in the score estimation network during the inference, based on a time-dependent exit schedule. Using the diffusion models for image synthesis, we show that our method could significantly improve the sampling throughput of the diffusion models without compromising image quality. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various types of solvers for faster sampling, capitalizing on their compatibility to enhance overall efficiency.

Recently, methods utilizing diffusion probabilistic models have achieved great success for adversarial purification in image classification tasks. However, such methods fall into the dilemma of balancing the needs for noise removal and information preservation. This paper points out that existing adversarial purification methods based on diffusion models gradually lose sample information during the core denoising process, causing occasional label shift in subsequent classification tasks. As a remedy, we suggest to suppress such information loss by introducing guidance from the classifier confidence. Specifically, we propose Classifier-cOnfidence gUided Purification (COUP) algorithm, which purifies adversarial examples while keeping away from the classifier decision boundary. Experimental results show that COUP can achieve better adversarial robustness under strong attack methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECAI 2024</p></details> |

Imperceptible image watermarking is one viable solution towards such concerns. Prior watermarking methods map the image to a latent space for adding the watermark. Moreover, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) generate the image in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. We argue that this latent space can be used to integrate watermarking into the generation process. To this end, we present LaWa, an in-generation image watermarking method designed for LDMs. By using coarse-to-fine watermark embedding modules, LaWa modifies the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders and achieves high robustness against a wide range of image transformations while preserving perceptual quality of the image. We show that LaWa can also be used as a general image watermarking method. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LaWa outperforms previous works in perceptual quality, robustness against attacks, and computational complexity, while having very low false positive rate.

| **[Residual Corrective Diffusion Modeling for Km-scale Atmospheric Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15214v4)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The state of the art for physical hazard prediction from weather and climate requires expensive km-scale numerical simulations driven by coarser resolution global inputs. Here, a generative diffusion architecture is explored for downscaling such global inputs to km-scale, as a cost-effective machine learning alternative. The model is trained to predict 2km data from a regional weather model over Taiwan, conditioned on a 25km global reanalysis. To address the large resolution ratio, different physics involved at different scales and prediction of channels beyond those in the input data, we employ a two-step approach where a UNet predicts the mean and a corrector diffusion (CorrDiff) model predicts the residual. CorrDiff exhibits encouraging skill in bulk MAE and CRPS scores. The predicted spectra and distributions from CorrDiff faithfully recover important power law relationships in the target data. Case studies of coherent weather phenomena show that CorrDiff can help sharpen wind and temperature gradients that co-locate with intense rainfall in cold front, and can help intensify typhoons and synthesize rain band structures. Calibration of model uncertainty remains challenging. The prospect of unifying methods like CorrDiff with coarser resolution global weather models implies a potential for global-to-regional multi-scale machine learning simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Egocentric Vision Language Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05802v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore leveraging large multi-modal models (LMMs) and text2image models to build a more general embodied agent. LMMs excel in planning long-horizon tasks over symbolic abstractions but struggle with grounding in the physical world, often failing to accurately identify object positions in images. A bridge is needed to connect LMMs to the physical world. The paper proposes a novel approach, egocentric vision language planning (EgoPlan), to handle long-horizon tasks from an egocentric perspective in varying household scenarios. This model leverages a diffusion model to simulate the fundamental dynamics between states and actions, integrating techniques like style transfer and optical flow to enhance generalization across different environmental dynamics. The LMM serves as a planner, breaking down instructions into sub-goals and selecting actions based on their alignment with these sub-goals, thus enabling more generalized and effective decision-making. Experiments show that EgoPlan improves long-horizon task success rates from the egocentric view compared to baselines across household scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Object Coherence in Layout-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10522v6)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Layout-to-image synthesis is an emerging technique in conditional image generation. It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and latent images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence relation into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the physical coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation.

| **[MTSCI: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05740v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing values are prevalent in multivariate time series, compromising the integrity of analyses and degrading the performance of downstream tasks. Consequently, research has focused on multivariate time series imputation, aiming to accurately impute the missing values based on available observations. A key research question is how to ensure imputation consistency, i.e., intra-consistency between observed and imputed values, and inter-consistency between adjacent windows after imputation. However, previous methods rely solely on the inductive bias of the imputation targets to guide the learning process, ignoring imputation consistency and ultimately resulting in poor performance. Diffusion models, known for their powerful generative abilities, prefer to generate consistent results based on available observations. Therefore, we propose a conditional diffusion model for Multivariate Time Series Consistent Imputation (MTSCI). Specifically, MTSCI employs a contrastive complementary mask to generate dual views during the forward noising process. Then, the intra contrastive loss is calculated to ensure intra-consistency between the imputed and observed values. Meanwhile, MTSCI utilizes a mixup mechanism to incorporate conditional information from adjacent windows during the denoising process, facilitating the inter-consistency between imputed samples. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series imputation task under different missing scenarios.

However, these generative models are prone to generating visual artifacts and false image structures, resulting in unnatural Real-ISR results. Based on the fact that natural images exhibit high self-similarities, i.e., a local patch can have many similar patches to it in the whole image, in this work we propose a simple yet effective self-similarity loss (SSL) to improve the performance of generative Real-ISR models, enhancing the hallucination of structural and textural details while reducing the unpleasant visual artifacts. Specifically, we compute a self-similarity graph (SSG) of the ground-truth image, and enforce the SSG of Real-ISR output to be close to it. To reduce the training cost and focus on edge areas, we generate an edge mask from the ground-truth image, and compute the SSG only on the masked pixels. The proposed SSL serves as a general plug-and-play penalty, which could be easily applied to the off-the-shelf Real-ISR models. Our experiments demonstrate that, by coupling with SSL, the performance of many state-of-the-art Real-ISR models, including those GAN and DM based ones, can be largely improved, reproducing more perceptually realistic image details and eliminating many false reconstructions and visual artifacts.

However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typically caused by traditional cropping methods and enriching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model module incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data.

This task is crucial for understanding the vulnerabilities of existing detection methods and developing more robust techniques. However, current adversarial attacks often introduce visible noise, have poor transferability, and fail to address spectral differences between AI-generated and genuine images. To address this, we propose StealthDiffusion, a framework based on stable diffusion that modifies AI-generated images into high-quality, imperceptible adversarial examples capable of evading state-of-the-art forensic detectors. StealthDiffusion comprises two main components: Latent Adversarial Optimization, which generates adversarial perturbations in the latent space of stable diffusion, and Control-VAE, a module that reduces spectral differences between the generated adversarial images and genuine images without affecting the original diffusion model's generation process. Extensive experiments show that StealthDiffusion is effective in both white-box and black-box settings, transforming AI-generated images into high-quality adversarial forgeries with frequency spectra similar to genuine images. These forgeries are classified as genuine by advanced forensic classifiers and are difficult for humans to distinguish.</p></details> |  |

While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, \textit{Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff)}, is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a \textbf{up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches.}</p></details> |  |

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model-based Contrastive Learning for Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05567v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based activity recognition has sparked numerous studies due to its widespread availability and privacy protection. However, when applied in practical applications, general CSI-based recognition models may face challenges related to the limited generalization capability, since individuals with different behavior habits will cause various fluctuations in CSI data and it is difficult to gather enough training data to cover all kinds of motion habits. To tackle this problem, we design a diffusion model-based Contrastive Learning framework for human Activity Recognition (CLAR) using WiFi CSI. On the basis of the contrastive learning framework, we primarily introduce two components for CLAR to enhance CSI-based activity recognition. To generate diverse augmented data and complement limited training data, we propose a diffusion model-based time series-specific augmentation model. In contrast to typical diffusion models that directly apply conditions to the generative process, potentially resulting in distorted CSI data, our tailored model dissects these condition into the high-frequency and low-frequency components, and then applies these conditions to the generative process with varying weights. This can alleviate data distortion and yield high-quality augmented data. To efficiently capture the difference of the sample importance, we present an adaptive weight algorithm. Different from typical contrastive learning methods which equally consider all the training samples, this algorithm adaptively adjusts the weights of positive sample pairs for learning better data representations. The experiments suggest that CLAR achieves significant gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

Previous methods, which are mainly GAN-based, still struggle to consistently produce satisfactory results across diverse emotions and cannot conveniently specify personalized emotions. In this work, we leverage powerful diffusion models to address the issue and propose DreamTalk, a framework that employs meticulous design to unlock the potential of diffusion models in generating emotional talking heads. Specifically, DreamTalk consists of three crucial components: a denoising network, a style-aware lip expert, and a style predictor. The diffusion-based denoising network can consistently synthesize high-quality audio-driven face motions across diverse emotions. To enhance lip-motion accuracy and emotional fullness, we introduce a style-aware lip expert that can guide lip-sync while preserving emotion intensity. To more conveniently specify personalized emotions, a diffusion-based style predictor is utilized to predict the personalized emotion directly from the audio, eliminating the need for extra emotion reference. By this means, DreamTalk can consistently generate vivid talking faces across diverse emotions and conveniently specify personalized emotions. Extensive experiments validate DreamTalk's effectiveness and superiority.

However, current portrait stylization methods generally require either model fine-tuning based on examples or the employment of DDIM Inversion to revert images to noise space, both of which substantially decelerate the image generation process. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an inversion-free portrait stylization framework based on diffusion models that accomplishes content and style feature fusion in merely four sampling steps. We observed that Latent Consistency Models employing consistency distillation can effectively extract representative Consistency Features from noisy images. To blend the Consistency Features extracted from both content and style images, we introduce a Style Enhancement Attention Control technique that meticulously merges content and style features within the attention space of the target image. Moreover, we propose a feature merging strategy to amalgamate redundant features in Consistency Features, thereby reducing the computational load of attention control. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing stylization efficiency and fidelity.

However, existing works on diffusion-based unrestricted attacks are mostly focused on images yet are seldom explored in videos. In this paper, we propose the Recursive Token Merging for Video Diffusion-based Unrestricted Adversarial Attack (ReToMe-VA), which is the first framework to generate imperceptible adversarial video clips with higher transferability. Specifically, to achieve spatial imperceptibility, ReToMe-VA adopts a Timestep-wise Adversarial Latent Optimization (TALO) strategy that optimizes perturbations in diffusion models' latent space at each denoising step. TALO offers iterative and accurate updates to generate more powerful adversarial frames. TALO can further reduce memory consumption in gradient computation. Moreover, to achieve temporal imperceptibility, ReToMe-VA introduces a Recursive Token Merging (ReToMe) mechanism by matching and merging tokens across video frames in the self-attention module, resulting in temporally consistent adversarial videos. ReToMe concurrently facilitates inter-frame interactions into the attack process, inducing more diverse and robust gradients, thus leading to better adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of ReToMe-VA, particularly in surpassing state-of-the-art attacks in adversarial transferability by more than 14.16% on average.</p></details> |  |

Though 2D diffusion has achieved success, a unified 3D diffusion pipeline remains unsettled. This paper introduces a novel framework called LN3Diff to address this gap and enable fast, high-quality, and generic conditional 3D generation. Our approach harnesses a 3D-aware architecture and variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode the input image into a structured, compact, and 3D latent space. The latent is decoded by a transformer-based decoder into a high-capacity 3D neural field. Through training a diffusion model on this 3D-aware latent space, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet for 3D generation and demonstrates superior performance in monocular 3D reconstruction and conditional 3D generation across various datasets.

| **[Multimodal generative semantic communication based on latent diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05455v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emergencies, the ability to quickly and accurately gather environmental data and command information, and to make timely decisions, is particularly critical. Traditional semantic communication frameworks, primarily based on a single modality, are susceptible to complex environments and lighting conditions, thereby limiting decision accuracy. To this end, this paper introduces a multimodal generative semantic communication framework named mm-GESCO. The framework ingests streams of visible and infrared modal image data, generates fused semantic segmentation maps, and transmits them using a combination of one-hot encoding and zlib compression techniques to enhance data transmission efficiency. At the receiving end, the framework can reconstruct the original multimodal images based on the semantic maps. Additionally, a latent diffusion model based on contrastive learning is designed to align different modal data within the latent space, allowing mm-GESCO to reconstruct latent features of any modality presented at the input. Experimental results demonstrate that mm-GESCO achieves a compression ratio of up to 200 times, surpassing the performance of existing semantic communication frameworks and exhibiting excellent performance in downstream tasks such as object classification and detection.</p></details> |  |

Some previous methods focus on learning a direct mapping from audio to visual content. Despite progress, they often struggle with the ambiguity of the mapping process, leading to flawed results. An alternative strategy involves facial structural representations (e.g., facial landmarks) as intermediaries. This multi-stage approach better preserves the appearance details but suffers from error accumulation due to the independent optimization of different stages. Moreover, most previous methods rely on generative adversarial networks, prone to training instability and mode collapse. To address these challenges, our study proposes a novel landmark-based diffusion model for talking face generation, which leverages facial landmarks as intermediate representations while enabling end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we first establish the less ambiguous mapping from audio to landmark motion of lip and jaw. Then, we introduce an innovative conditioning module called TalkFormer to align the synthesized motion with the motion represented by landmarks via differentiable cross-attention, which enables end-to-end optimization for improved lip synchronization. Besides, TalkFormer employs implicit feature warping to align the reference image features with the target motion for preserving more appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can synthesize high-fidelity and lip-synced talking face videos, preserving more subject appearance details from the reference image.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing(TIP)</p></details> |

Individuals exhibit distinct lip shapes when speaking the same utterance, attributed to the unique speaking styles of individuals, posing a notable challenge for audio-driven lip sync. Earlier methods for such task often bypassed the modeling of personalized speaking styles, resulting in sub-optimal lip sync conforming to the general styles. Recent lip sync techniques attempt to guide the lip sync for arbitrary audio by aggregating information from a style reference video, yet they can not preserve the speaking styles well due to their inaccuracy in style aggregation. This work proposes an innovative audio-aware style reference scheme that effectively leverages the relationships between input audio and reference audio from style reference video to address the style-preserving audio-driven lip sync. Specifically, we first develop an advanced Transformer-based model adept at predicting lip motion corresponding to the input audio, augmented by the style information aggregated through cross-attention layers from style reference video. Afterwards, to better render the lip motion into realistic talking face video, we devise a conditional latent diffusion model, integrating lip motion through modulated convolutional layers and fusing reference facial images via spatial cross-attention layers. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving precise lip sync, preserving speaking styles, and generating high-fidelity, realistic talking face videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing(TIP)</p></details> |

However, due to limited sample sizes and significant data loss during collection for various reasons, some machine learning methods have been proposed to address the issue of missing data. These methods have not fully utilized the known clinical information of patients to enhance the accuracy of data imputation. Therefore, we introduce mbVDiT, a novel pre-trained conditional diffusion model for microbiome data imputation and denoising, which uses the unmasked data and patient metadata as conditional guidance for imputating missing values. It is also uses VAE to integrate the the other public microbiome datasets to enhance model performance. The results on the microbiome datasets from three different cancer types demonstrate the performance of our methods in comparison with existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The method focuses on generating customized models wearing various targeted outfits according to different text prompts. The primary challenge lies in maintaining the natural appearance of the dressed model while preserving the complex textures of each piece of clothing, ensuring that the information from different garments does not interfere with each other. To tackle these challenges, we first developed a garment encoder, which is a trainable UNet copy with shared weights, capable of extracting detailed features of garments in parallel. Secondly, our framework supports the conditional generation of multiple garments through decoupled multi-garment feature fusion, allowing multiple clothing features to be injected into the backbone network, significantly alleviating conflicts between garment information. Additionally, the proposed garment encoder is a plug-and-play module that can be combined with other extension modules such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet, enhancing the diversity and controllability of the generated models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing alternatives, opening up new avenues for the task of generating images with multiple-piece clothing combinations</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages conditional diffusion models coupled with the underlying physics of wave-propagation and symmetries in the problem, to produce highly accurate reconstructions. The framework introduces a factorization of the score function into a physics-based latent representation inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula and a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps are also constrained to obey symmetries in the formulation while being amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. As a result, empirically, our framework is able to provide sharp reconstructions effortlessly, even recovering sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime. It has low-sample and computational complexity, its number of parameters scales sub-linearly with the target resolution, and it has stable training dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning-based inversion algorithms have shown promising performance in regional (i.e., for exploration) and global velocity estimation, while their effectiveness hinges on access to large and diverse training datasets whose distributions generally cover the target solutions. Additionally, enhancing the precision and reliability of velocity estimation also requires incorporating prior information, e.g., geological classes, well logs, and subsurface structures, but current statistical or neural network-based methods are not flexible enough to handle such multi-modal information. To address both challenges, we propose to use conditional generative diffusion models for seismic velocity synthesis, in which we readily incorporate those priors. This approach enables the generation of seismic velocities that closely match the expected target distribution, offering datasets informed by both expert knowledge and measured data to support training for data-driven geophysical methods. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our method through training diffusion models on the OpenFWI dataset under various conditions, including class labels, well logs, reflectivity images, and the combination of these priors. The performance of the approach under out-of-distribution conditions further underscores its generalization ability, showcasing its potential to provide tailored priors for velocity inverse problems and create specific training datasets for machine learning-based geophysical applications.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the flow-based diffusion model has become a new trend for generations. Yet, adapting SDS to flow-based diffusion models in 3D generation remains unexplored. Our work is aimed to bridge this gap. In this paper, we adapt SDS to rectified flow and re-examine the over-smoothing issue under this novel framework. The issue can be explained that the model learns an average of multiple ODE trajectories. Then we propose DreamCouple, which instead of randomly sampling noise, uses a rectified flow model to find the coupled noise. Its Unique Couple Matching (UCM) loss guides the model to learn different trajectories and thus solves the over-smoothing issue. We apply our method to both NeRF and 3D Gaussian splatting and achieve state-of-the-art performances. We also identify some other interesting open questions such as initialization issues for NeRF and faster training convergence. Our code will be released soon.</p></details> | Tech Report |

Building upon this, researchers have extended 2D text-to-image diffusion models into the 3D domain for generating human textures (UV Maps). However, some important problems about UV Map Generative models are still not solved, i.e., how to generate personalized texture maps for any given face image, and how to define and evaluate the quality of these generated texture maps. To solve the above problems, we introduce a novel method, UVMap-ID, which is a controllable and personalized UV Map generative model. Unlike traditional large-scale training methods in 2D, we propose to fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model which is integrated with a face fusion module for achieving ID-driven customized generation. To support the finetuning strategy, we introduce a small-scale attribute-balanced training dataset, including high-quality textures with labeled text and Face ID. Additionally, we introduce some metrics to evaluate the multiple aspects of the textures.

Its potential in healthcare is significant, but challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data, exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues. CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation. The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution differences across clients without compromising privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>I fou...</summary><p>I found critical errors in the manuscript affecting its validity.

| **[Adversarially Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection Through Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04839v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based industrial anomaly detection models have achieved remarkably high accuracy on commonly used benchmark datasets. However, the robustness of those models may not be satisfactory due to the existence of adversarial examples, which pose significant threats to the practical deployment of deep anomaly detectors. Recently, it has been shown that diffusion models can be used to purify the adversarial noises and thus build a robust classifier against adversarial attacks. Unfortunately, we found that naively applying this strategy in anomaly detection (i.e., placing a purifier before an anomaly detector) will suffer from a high anomaly miss rate since the purifying process can easily remove both the anomaly signal and the adversarial perturbations, causing the later anomaly detector failed to detect anomalies. To tackle this issue, we explore the possibility of performing anomaly detection and adversarial purification simultaneously. We propose a simple yet effective adversarially robust anomaly detection method, \textit{AdvRAD}, that allows the diffusion model to act both as an anomaly detector and adversarial purifier. We also extend our proposed method for certified robustness to $l_2$ norm bounded perturbations. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method exhibits outstanding (certified) adversarial robustness while also maintaining equally strong anomaly detection performance on par with the state-of-the-art methods on industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we explore the transformative potential of GAI in next-generation Wi-Fi networks, exploiting its advanced capabilities to address key challenges and improve overall network performance. We begin by reviewing the development of major Wi-Fi generations and illustrating the challenges that future Wi-Fi networks may encounter. We then introduce typical GAI models and detail their potential capabilities in Wi-Fi network optimization, performance enhancement, and other applications. Furthermore, we present a case study wherein we propose a retrieval-augmented LLM (RA-LLM)-enabled Wi-Fi design framework that aids in problem formulation, which is subsequently solved using a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize various network parameters. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in high-density deployment scenarios. Finally, we provide some potential future research directions for GAI-assisted Wi-Fi networks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose Diffusion Reward, a novel framework that learns rewards from expert videos via conditional video diffusion models for solving complex visual RL problems. Our key insight is that lower generative diversity is exhibited when conditioning diffusion on expert trajectories. Diffusion Reward is accordingly formalized by the negative of conditional entropy that encourages productive exploration of expert behaviors. We show the efficacy of our method over robotic manipulation tasks in both simulation platforms and the real world with visual input. Moreover, Diffusion Reward can even solve unseen tasks successfully and effectively, largely surpassing baseline methods.

We note that textual inversion has been underexplored using alternatives to the UNet, and experiment with textual inversion with a vision transformer. We also seek to optimize textual inversion using a strategy that does not require explicit use of the UNet and its idiosyncratic layers, so we add bonus tokens and enforce orthogonality. We find the use of the bonus token improves adherence to the source images and the use of the vision transformer improves adherence to the prompt.

| **[Zero-Shot Uncertainty Quantification using Diffusion Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04718v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of diffusion probabilistic models in generative tasks, such as text-to-image generation, has motivated the exploration of their application to regression problems commonly encountered in scientific computing and various other domains. In this context, the use of diffusion regression models for ensemble prediction is becoming a practice with increasing popularity. Under such background, we conducted a study to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of ensemble methods on solving different regression problems using diffusion models. We consider the ensemble prediction of a diffusion model as a means for zero-shot uncertainty quantification, since the diffusion models in our study are not trained with a loss function containing any uncertainty estimation. Through extensive experiments on 1D and 2D data, we demonstrate that ensemble methods consistently improve model prediction accuracy across various regression tasks. Notably, we observed a larger accuracy gain in auto-regressive prediction compared with point-wise prediction, and that enhancements take place in both the mean-square error and the physics-informed loss. Additionally, we reveal a statistical correlation between ensemble prediction error and ensemble variance, offering insights into balancing computational complexity with prediction accuracy and monitoring prediction confidence in practical applications where the ground truth is unknown. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the utility of diffusion ensembles, serving as a useful reference for practitioners employing diffusion models in regression problem-solving.</p></details> |  |

At test time, given a single image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories. Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark.

Since diffusion-based methods typically require significant optimization time for both training and inference, the use of GAN-based models would still be desirable for fast 3D generation. In this work, we propose Triplane Attention for text-guided 3D generation (TPA3D), an end-to-end trainable GAN-based deep learning model for fast text-to-3D generation. With only 3D shape data and their rendered 2D images observed during training, our TPA3D is designed to retrieve detailed visual descriptions for synthesizing the corresponding 3D mesh data. This is achieved by the proposed attention mechanisms on the extracted sentence and word-level text features. In our experiments, we show that TPA3D generates high-quality 3D textured shapes aligned with fine-grained descriptions, while impressive computation efficiency can be observed.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |

Sketch-based input offers a natural, and convenient way to convey the user's design intention in the content creation process. To circumvent the data-deficient challenge in learning (i.e. the lack of large training data of 3D scenes), our method leverages a pre-trained 2D denoising diffusion model to generate a 2D image of the scene as the conceptual guidance. In this process, we adopt the isometric projection mode to factor out unknown camera poses while obtaining the scene layout. From the generated isometric image, we use a pre-trained image understanding method to segment the image into meaningful parts, such as off-ground objects, trees, and buildings, and extract the 2D scene layout. These segments and layouts are subsequently fed into a procedural content generation (PCG) engine, such as a 3D video game engine like Unity or Unreal, to create the 3D scene. The resulting 3D scene can be seamlessly integrated into a game development environment and is readily playable. Extensive tests demonstrate that our method can efficiently generate high-quality and interactive 3D game scenes with layouts that closely follow the user's intention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xrvisionlabs.github.io/Sketch2Scene/</p></details> |

However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG) to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss, utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and an FID of 9.56 with a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2.

Although the problem has been studied for years under names such as Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, or Inverse Reinforcement Learning, classical methods have relied on models that don't capture complex data distributions well or don't scale well to large numbers of demonstrations. In recent years, the robot learning community has shown increasing interest in using deep generative models to capture the complexity of large datasets. In this survey, we aim to provide a unified and comprehensive review of the last year's progress in the use of deep generative models in robotics. We present the different types of models that the community has explored, such as energy-based models, diffusion models, action value maps, or generative adversarial networks. We also present the different types of applications in which deep generative models have been used, from grasp generation to trajectory generation or cost learning. One of the most important elements of generative models is the generalization out of distributions. In our survey, we review the different decisions the community has made to improve the generalization of the learned models. Finally, we highlight the research challenges and propose a number of future directions for learning deep generative models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, submitted to TRO</p></details> |

| **[Towards Flexible Visual Relationship Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08305v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual relationship understanding has been studied separately in human-object interaction(HOI) detection, scene graph generation(SGG), and referring relationships(RR) tasks. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these tasks, it is crucial to have a flexible framework that can effectively address these tasks in a cohesive manner. In this work, we propose FleVRS, a single model that seamlessly integrates the above three aspects in standard and promptable visual relationship segmentation, and further possesses the capability for open-vocabulary segmentation to adapt to novel scenarios. FleVRS leverages the synergy between text and image modalities, to ground various types of relationships from images and use textual features from vision-language models to visual conceptual understanding. Empirical validation across various datasets demonstrates that our framework outperforms existing models in standard, promptable, and open-vocabulary tasks, e.g., +1.9 $mAP$ on HICO-DET, +11.4 $Acc$ on VRD, +4.7 $mAP$ on unseen HICO-DET. Our FleVRS represents a significant step towards a more intuitive, comprehensive, and scalable understanding of visual relationships.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevalent assumption of having an extensive pool of training data encompassing all classes prior to model training often diverges from real-world scenarios, where limited data availability for novel classes is the norm. The challenge emerges in seamlessly integrating new classes with few samples into the training data, demanding the model to adeptly accommodate these additions without compromising its performance on base classes. To address this exigency, the research community has introduced several solutions under the realm of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL). In this study, we introduce an innovative FSCIL framework that utilizes language regularizer and subspace regularizer. During base training, the language regularizer helps incorporate semantic information extracted from a Vision-Language model. The subspace regularizer helps in facilitating the model's acquisition of nuanced connections between image and text semantics inherent to base classes during incremental training. Our proposed framework not only empowers the model to embrace novel classes with limited data, but also ensures the preservation of performance on base classes. To substantiate the efficacy of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three distinct FSCIL benchmarks, where our framework attains state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Conventional methods rely on specialized architectures trained on specific datasets, which struggle to be adapted to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, effective strategies for vision downstream tasks with VLMs remain largely unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for better image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, named Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP with Generative Latent Replay: a Strong Baseline for Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15793v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of Transformers and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP, fine-tuning large pre-trained models has recently become a prevalent strategy in Continual Learning. This has led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to adapt transformer-based models without incurring catastrophic forgetting. However, these strategies often compromise the original zero-shot capabilities of the pre-trained CLIP model and struggle to adapt to domains that significantly deviate from the pre-training data. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a simple and novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting CLIP. Briefly, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to learn class-conditioned distributions within the embedding space of the visual encoder. We then exploit these distributions to sample new synthetic visual embeddings and train the corresponding class-specific textual prompts during subsequent tasks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we show that such a generative replay approach can adapt to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities, evaluated using a novel metric tailored for CL scenarios. Notably, further analysis reveals that our approach can bridge the gap with joint prompt tuning.

To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for video ReID under Ground-to-Aerial scenarios. G2A-VReID dataset has the following characteristics: 1) Drastic view changes; 2) Large number of annotated identities; 3) Rich outdoor scenarios; 4) Huge difference in resolution. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark approach for cross-platform ReID by transforming the cross-platform visual alignment problem into visual-semantic alignment through vision-language model (i.e., CLIP) and applying a parameter-efficient Video Set-Level-Adapter module to adapt image-based foundation model to video ReID tasks, termed VSLA-CLIP. Besides, to further reduce the great discrepancy across the platforms, we also devise the platform-bridge prompts for efficient visual feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on all existing video ReID datasets and our proposed G2A-VReID dataset.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language model to templates built from random words and characters. Up until now, deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors has remained nearly unchanged, i.e., classify to the class that maximizes cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the image encoding. However, weighing all class descriptors equally can be suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP tunes per-image weights to each prompt template at inference time, based on statistics of class descriptor-image similarities. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has only a minor additional computation overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that AutoCLIP outperforms baselines across a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates consistently and by up to 3 percent point accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at TMLR, Camera Ready Version</p></details> |
| **[Vision Language Model for Interpretable and Fine-grained Detection of Safety Compliance in Diverse Workplaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07146v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Workplace accidents due to personal protective equipment (PPE) non-compliance raise serious safety concerns and lead to legal liabilities, financial penalties, and reputational damage. While object detection models have shown the capability to address this issue by identifying safety items, most existing models, such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and SSD, are limited in verifying the fine-grained attributes of PPE across diverse workplace scenarios. Vision language models (VLMs) are gaining traction for detection tasks by leveraging the synergy between visual and textual information, offering a promising solution to traditional object detection limitations in PPE recognition. Nonetheless, VLMs face challenges in consistently verifying PPE attributes due to the complexity and variability of workplace environments, requiring them to interpret context-specific language and visual cues simultaneously. We introduce Clip2Safety, an interpretable detection framework for diverse workplace safety compliance, which comprises four main modules: scene recognition, the visual prompt, safety items detection, and fine-grained verification. The scene recognition identifies the current scenario to determine the necessary safety gear. The visual prompt formulates the specific visual prompts needed for the detection process. The safety items detection identifies whether the required safety gear is being worn according to the specified scenario. Lastly, the fine-grained verification assesses whether the worn safety equipment meets the fine-grained attribute requirements. We conduct real-world case studies across six different scenarios. The results show that Clip2Safety not only demonstrates an accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art question-answering based VLMs but also achieves inference times two hundred times faster.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

However, it is unclear if these models are robust to distribution shifts, and how their performance and generalization capabilities vary under changes in data distribution. In this project we strive to answer the question "Are vision-language foundational models robust to distribution shifts like human perception?" Specifically, we consider a diverse range of vision-language models and compare how the performance of these systems is affected by corruption based distribution shifts (such as \textit{motion blur, fog, snow, gaussian noise}) commonly found in practical real-world scenarios. We analyse the generalization capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively on zero-shot image classification task under aforementioned distribution shifts.

Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, also lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks: object classification, understanding spatial arrangement, and ability to delineate individual object instances (through counting), by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, maybe lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, that simply measure final performance of VLM, by also comparing and contrasting it to performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from visual encoder (image embeddings), as well as intermediate vision-language projection used to bridge image-encoder and LLM-decoder ouput in many SoTA models (e.g., LLaVA, BLIP, InstructBLIP). In doing so, we uncover nascent shortcomings in VLMs response and make a number of important observations which could help train and develop more effective VLM models in future.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[PromptKD: Unsupervised Prompt Distillation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02781v5)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a valuable technique in enhancing vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP for downstream tasks in specific domains. Existing work mainly focuses on designing various learning forms of prompts, neglecting the potential of prompts as effective distillers for learning from larger teacher models. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised domain prompt distillation framework, which aims to transfer the knowledge of a larger teacher model to a lightweight target model through prompt-driven imitation using unlabeled domain images. Specifically, our framework consists of two distinct stages. In the initial stage, we pre-train a large CLIP teacher model using domain (few-shot) labels. After pre-training, we leverage the unique decoupled-modality characteristics of CLIP by pre-computing and storing the text features as class vectors only once through the teacher text encoder. In the subsequent stage, the stored class vectors are shared across teacher and student image encoders for calculating the predicted logits. Further, we align the logits of both the teacher and student models via KL divergence, encouraging the student image encoder to generate similar probability distributions to the teacher through the learnable prompts. The proposed prompt distillation process eliminates the reliance on labeled data, enabling the algorithm to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled images within the domain. Finally, the well-trained student image encoders and pre-stored text features (class vectors) are utilized for inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to (1) perform unsupervised domain-specific prompt-driven knowledge distillation for CLIP, and (2) establish a practical pre-storing mechanism of text features as shared class vectors between teacher and student. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024. Project Page: https://zhengli97.github.io/PromptKD.

However, the absence of a general measurement for evaluating object hallucination in VL models has hindered our understanding and ability to mitigate this issue. In this work, we present NOPE (Negative Object Presence Evaluation), a novel benchmark designed to assess object hallucination in VL models through visual question answering (VQA). We propose a cost-effective and scalable approach utilizing large language models to generate 29.5k synthetic negative pronoun (NegP) data of high quality for NOPE. We extensively investigate the performance of 10 state-of-the-art VL models in discerning the non-existence of objects in visual questions, where the ground truth answers are denoted as NegP (e.g., "none"). Additionally, we evaluate their standard performance on visual questions on 9 other VQA datasets. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that no VL model is immune to the vulnerability of object hallucination, as all models achieve accuracy below 10\% on NegP. Furthermore, we uncover that lexically diverse visual questions, question types with large scopes, and scene-relevant objects capitalize the risk of object hallucination in VL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ALVR Workshop at ACL 2024</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a large vision-language model (LVLM) named IFShip for interpretable fine-grained ship classification. Unlike traditional methods, IFShip excels in interpretability by accurately conveying the reasoning process of FGSC in natural language. Specifically, we first design a domain knowledge-enhanced Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompt generation mechanism. This mechanism is used to semi-automatically construct a task-specific instruction-following dataset named TITANIC-FGS, which emulates human-like logical decision-making. We then train the IFShip model using task instructions tuned with the TITANIC-FGS dataset. Building on IFShip, we develop an FGSC visual chatbot that redefines the FGSC problem as a step-by-step reasoning task and conveys the reasoning process in natural language. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art FGSC algorithms in both classification interpretability and accuracy. Moreover, compared to LVLMs like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, our approach demonstrates superior expertise in the FGSC task. It provides an accurate chain of reasoning when fine-grained ship types are recognizable to the human eye and offers interpretable explanations when they are not.</p></details> |  |

In addition to pre-trained video models, contemporary methods utilize pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) to capture detailed characteristics of diverse scenes and objects from video frames. However, as pre-trained on images, VLM may struggle to distinguish action-sensitive patterns from static objects, making it necessary to adapt them to specific data domains for effective feature representation over temporal grounding. We address two primary challenges to achieve this goal. Specifically, to mitigate high adaptation costs, we propose an efficient preliminary in-domain fine-tuning paradigm for feature adaptation, where downstream-adaptive features are learned through several pretext tasks. Furthermore, to integrate action-sensitive information into VLM, we introduce Action-Cue-Injected Temporal Prompt Learning (ActPrompt), which injects action cues into the image encoder of VLM for better discovering action-sensitive patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActPrompt is an off-the-shelf training framework that can be effectively applied to various SOTA methods, resulting in notable improvements. The complete code used in this study is provided in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Models Generalization via Diversity-Driven Novel Feature Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02586v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot generalization, but finetuning on downstream datasets can cause overfitting and loss of its generalization ability on unseen domains. Although collecting additional data from new domains of interest is possible, this method is often impractical due to the challenges in obtaining annotated data. To address this, we propose a plug-and-play feature synthesis method called LDFS (Language-Guided Diverse Feature Synthesis) to synthesize new domain features and improve existing CLIP fine-tuning strategies. LDFS has three main contributions: 1) To synthesize novel domain features and promote diversity, we propose an instance-conditional feature augmentation strategy based on a text-guided feature augmentation loss. 2) To maintain feature quality after augmenting, we introduce a pairwise regularizer to preserve augmented feature coherence within the CLIP feature space. 3) We propose to use stochastic text feature augmentation to reduce the modality gap and further facilitate the process of text-guided feature synthesis. Extensive experiments show LDFS superiority in improving CLIP generalization ability on unseen domains without collecting data from those domains. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18957v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online user generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-Guard, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-Guard achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium, August 14-16, 2024</p></details> |

We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations with BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers to be plausible, but generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate the ability of VQA models to abstain from answering unanswerable questions across multiple prompting strategies.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

The OpenIns3D framework employs a "Mask-Snap-Lookup" scheme. The "Mask" module learns class-agnostic mask proposals in 3D point clouds, the "Snap" module generates synthetic scene-level images at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract interesting objects, and the "Lookup" module searches through the outcomes of "Snap" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet simple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D open-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance segmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D facilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without requiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it achieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks. Furthermore, when combined with LLM-powered 2D models, OpenIns3D exhibits an impressive capability to comprehend and process highly complex text queries that demand intricate reasoning and real-world knowledge.

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

| **[Learning Invariant Causal Mechanism from Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15289v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP have been widely applied to a variety of downstream scenarios. In real-world applications, the CLIP model is often utilized in more diverse scenarios than those encountered during its training, a challenge known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem. However, our experiments reveal that CLIP performs unsatisfactorily in certain domains. Through a causal analysis, we find that CLIP's current prediction process cannot guarantee a low OOD risk. The lowest OOD risk can be achieved when the prediction process is based on invariant causal mechanisms, i.e., predicting solely based on invariant latent factors. However, theoretical analysis indicates that CLIP does not identify these invariant latent factors. Therefore, we propose the Invariant Causal Mechanism for CLIP (CLIP-ICM), a framework that first identifies invariant latent factors using interventional data and then performs invariant predictions across various domains. Our method is simple yet effective, without significant computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIP-ICM significantly improves CLIP's performance in OOD scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting a Foundation Model for Space-based Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05924v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[GlyphPattern: An Abstract Pattern Recognition for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05894v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) building upon the foundation of powerful large language models have made rapid progress in reasoning across visual and textual data. While VLMs perform well on vision tasks that they are trained on, our results highlight key challenges in abstract pattern recognition. We present GlyphPattern, a 954 item dataset that pairs 318 human-written descriptions of visual patterns from 40 writing systems with three visual presentation styles. GlyphPattern evaluates abstract pattern recognition in VLMs, requiring models to understand and judge natural language descriptions of visual patterns. GlyphPattern patterns are drawn from a large-scale cognitive science investigation of human writing systems; as a result, they are rich in spatial reference and compositionality. Our experiments show that GlyphPattern is challenging for state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o achieves only 55% accuracy), with marginal gains from few-shot prompting. Our detailed error analysis reveals challenges at multiple levels, including visual processing, natural language understanding, and pattern generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Generative Communication between Embodied Agents Good for Zero-Shot ObjectNav?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01877v2)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Zero-Shot ObjectNav, an embodied ground agent is expected to navigate to a target object specified by a natural language label without any environment-specific fine-tuning. This is challenging, given the limited view of a ground agent and its independent exploratory behavior. To address these issues, we consider an assistive overhead agent with a bounded global view alongside the ground agent and present two coordinated navigation schemes for judicious exploration. We establish the influence of the Generative Communication (GC) between the embodied agents equipped with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in improving zero-shot ObjectNav, achieving a 10% improvement in the ground agent's ability to find the target object in comparison with an unassisted setup in simulation. We further analyze the GC for unique traits quantifying the presence of hallucination and cooperation. In particular, we identify a unique trait of "preemptive hallucination" specific to our embodied setting, where the overhead agent assumes that the ground agent has executed an action in the dialogue when it is yet to move. Finally, we conduct real-world inferences with GC and showcase qualitative examples where countering pre-emptive hallucination via prompt finetuning improves real-world ObjectNav performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05775v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models have showcased impressive zero-shot classification capabilities when equipped with suitable text prompts. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of test-time prompt tuning; however, these methods typically require per-image prompt adaptation during inference, which incurs high computational budgets and limits scalability and practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we introduce Self-TPT, a novel framework leveraging Self-supervised learning for efficient Test-time Prompt Tuning. The key aspect of Self-TPT is that it turns to efficient predefined class adaptation via self-supervised learning, thus avoiding computation-heavy per-image adaptation at inference. Self-TPT begins by co-training the self-supervised and the classification task using source data, then applies the self-supervised task exclusively for test-time new class adaptation. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning (CPT) as the key task for self-supervision. CPT is designed to minimize the intra-class distances while enhancing inter-class distinguishability via contrastive learning. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that CPT could closely mimic back-propagated gradients of the classification task, offering a plausible explanation for its effectiveness. Motivated by this finding, we further introduce a gradient matching loss to explicitly enhance the gradient similarity. We evaluated Self-TPT across three challenging zero-shot benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate that Self-TPT not only significantly reduces inference costs but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing the efficiency-efficacy trade-off.</p></details> |  |

While LVLMs exhibit excellent ability in language understanding, question answering, and conversations of visual inputs, they are prone to producing hallucinations. While several methods are proposed to evaluate the hallucinations in LVLMs, most are reference-based and depend on external tools, which complicates their practical application. To assess the viability of alternative methods, it is critical to understand whether the reference-free approaches, which do not rely on any external tools, can efficiently detect hallucinations. Therefore, we initiate an exploratory study to demonstrate the effectiveness of different reference-free solutions in detecting hallucinations in LVLMs. In particular, we conduct an extensive study on three kinds of techniques: uncertainty-based, consistency-based, and supervised uncertainty quantification methods on four representative LVLMs across two different tasks. The empirical results show that the reference-free approaches are capable of effectively detecting non-factual responses in LVLMs, with the supervised uncertainty quantification method outperforming the others, achieving the best performance across different settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images poses a challenge in acquiring feature representations that align well with images on real scenes, thereby limiting the performance of these methods. We note that vision-language models like CLIP, pre-trained on extensive real image-text pairs, effectively align images and text in a unified embedding space, suggesting the potential to derive the representations of real images from text alone. Building upon this premise, we introduce a novel method named Decoder Pre-training with only text for STR (DPTR). DPTR treats text embeddings produced by the CLIP text encoder as pseudo visual embeddings and uses them to pre-train the decoder. An Offline Randomized Perturbation (ORP) strategy is introduced. It enriches the diversity of text embeddings by incorporating natural image embeddings extracted from the CLIP image encoder, effectively directing the decoder to acquire the potential representations of real images. In addition, we introduce a Feature Merge Unit (FMU) that guides the extracted visual embeddings focusing on the character foreground within the text image, thereby enabling the pre-trained decoder to work more efficiently and accurately. Extensive experiments across various STR decoders and language recognition tasks underscore the broad applicability and remarkable performance of DPTR, providing a novel insight for STR pre-training.

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p></details> |  |

Among these cutting-edge developments, Google's Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of $42$ standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere $2.1$K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

However, their application in modern vision-language models (VLMs) has been limited. A notable exception is MERU, which leverages the hierarchical properties of hyperbolic space in the CLIP ViT-large model, consisting of hundreds of millions parameters. In our work, we address the challenges of scaling multi-modal hyperbolic models by orders of magnitude in terms of parameters (billions) and training complexity using the BLIP-2 architecture. Although hyperbolic embeddings offer potential insights into uncertainty not present in Euclidean embeddings, our analysis reveals that scaling these models is particularly difficult. We propose a novel training strategy for a hyperbolic version of BLIP-2, which allows to achieve comparable performance to its Euclidean counterpart, while maintaining stability throughout the training process and showing a meaningful indication of uncertainty with each embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 - Beyond Euclidean Workshop</p></details> |

Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently unreasonable? To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03% and 100% accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the performance of Gemini-Pro in the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot example.</p></details> |  |

In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoid Wasted Annotation Costs in Open-set Active Learning with Pre-trained Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04917v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) aims to enhance model performance by selectively collecting highly informative data, thereby minimizing annotation costs. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, leading to wasted annotation costs if data is incorrectly selected. Recent research has explored methods to apply AL to open-set data, but these methods often require or incur unavoidable cost losses to minimize them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel selection strategy, CLIPN for AL (CLIPNAL), which minimizes cost losses without requiring OOD samples. CLIPNAL sequentially evaluates the purity and informativeness of data. First, it utilizes a pre-trained vision-language model to detect and exclude OOD data by leveraging linguistic and visual information of in-distribution (ID) data without additional training. Second, it selects highly informative data from the remaining ID data, and then the selected samples are annotated by human experts. Experimental results on datasets with various open-set conditions demonstrate that CLIPNAL achieves the lowest cost loss and highest performance across all scenarios.

| **[Advancing Prompt Learning through an External Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19674v5)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding evaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition. Additionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the overall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more finely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width adjustment, style change, and address augmentation. We propose variants of prompts to address the above tasks in different settings. Notably, to leverage the strengths of VLMs in understanding text rather than two-dimensional positioning, we propose to decode cell values on the four boundaries of the table in spreadsheet boundary detection. Our findings reveal that VLMs demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due to cell omission and misalignment, and they notably exhibit insufficient spatial and format recognition skills, motivating future work to enhance VLMs' spreadsheet data comprehension capabilities using our methods to generate extensive spreadsheet-image pairs in various settings.</p></details> |  |

The proposed VLM-MPC system is structurally divided into two asynchronous components: an upper-level VLM and a lower-level MPC. The upper layer VLM generates driving parameters for lower-level control based on front camera images, ego vehicle state, traffic environment conditions, and reference memory. The lower-level MPC controls the vehicle in real-time using these parameters, considering engine lag and providing state feedback to the entire system. Experiments based on the nuScenes dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed VLM-MPC system across various scenarios (e.g., night, rain, intersections). Results showed that the VLM-MPC system consistently outperformed baseline models in terms of safety and driving comfort. By comparing behaviors under different weather conditions and scenarios, we demonstrated the VLM's ability to understand the environment and make reasonable inferences.</p></details> |  |

Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radar Spectra-Language Model for Automotive Scene Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02158v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radar sensors are low cost, long-range, and weather-resilient. Therefore, they are widely used for driver assistance functions, and are expected to be crucial for the success of autonomous driving in the future. In many perception tasks only pre-processed radar point clouds are considered. In contrast, radar spectra are a raw form of radar measurements and contain more information than radar point clouds. However, radar spectra are rather difficult to interpret. In this work, we aim to explore the semantic information contained in spectra in the context of automated driving, thereby moving towards better interpretability of radar spectra. To this end, we create a radar spectra-language model, allowing us to query radar spectra measurements for the presence of scene elements using free text. We overcome the scarcity of radar spectra data by matching the embedding space of an existing vision-language model. Finally, we explore the benefit of the learned representation for scene retrieval using radar spectra only, and obtain improvements in free space segmentation and object detection merely by injecting the spectra embedding into a baseline model.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel, easy-to-use approach to achieving high-quality representations that lead to adversarial robustness through the use of multi-resolution input representations and dynamic self-ensembling of intermediate layer predictions. We demonstrate that intermediate layer predictions exhibit inherent robustness to adversarial attacks crafted to fool the full classifier, and propose a robust aggregation mechanism based on Vickrey auction that we call \textit{CrossMax} to dynamically ensemble them. By combining multi-resolution inputs and robust ensembling, we achieve significant adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets without any adversarial training or extra data, reaching an adversarial accuracy of $\approx$72% (CIFAR-10) and $\approx$48% (CIFAR-100) on the RobustBench AutoAttack suite ($L_\infty=8/255)$ with a finetuned ImageNet-pretrained ResNet152. This represents a result comparable with the top three models on CIFAR-10 and a +5 % gain compared to the best current dedicated approach on CIFAR-100. Adding simple adversarial training on top, we get $\approx$78% on CIFAR-10 and $\approx$51% on CIFAR-100, improving SOTA by 5 % and 9 % respectively and seeing greater gains on the harder dataset. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and provide insights into the interplay between adversarial robustness, and the hierarchical nature of deep representations. We show that simple gradient-based attacks against our model lead to human-interpretable images of the target classes as well as interpretable image changes. As a byproduct, using our multi-resolution prior, we turn pre-trained classifiers and CLIP models into controllable image generators and develop successful transferable attacks on large vision language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 25 figures, appendix</p></details> |

In robotic grasping, estimating the reflectance of objects is crucial for successful grasping, as it significantly impacts the distance measured by proximity sensors. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate reflectance from object names alone, leveraging the embedded human knowledge in distributional semantics, and if the latent structure of language in VLMs positively affects image-based reflectance estimation. In this paper, we verify that 1) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text as input; and 2) VLMs such as CLIP can increase their generalization capabilities in reflectance estimation from images. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text input with a mean error of 14.7%, lower than the image-only ResNet. Moreover, CLIP achieved the lowest mean error of 11.8%, while GPT-3.5 obtained a competitive 19.9% compared to ResNet's 17.8%. These results suggest that the distributional semantics in LLMs and VLMs increases their generalization capabilities, and the knowledge acquired by VLMs benefits from the latent structure of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Advanced Robotics Special Issue on Real-World Robot Applications of the Foundation Models</p></details> |
| **[From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12668v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtVLM: Attribute Recognition Through Vision-Based Prefix Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04102v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, how well these VLMs can see image detail beyond the semantic level remains unclear. In our study, we introduce a pixel value prediction task (PVP) to explore "How Well Can Vision Language Models See Image Details?" and to assist VLMs in perceiving more details. Typically, these models comprise a frozen CLIP visual encoder, a large language model, and a connecting module. After fine-tuning VLMs on the PVP task, we find: 1) existing VLMs struggle to predict precise pixel values by only fine-tuning the connection module and LLM; and 2) prediction precision is significantly improved when the vision encoder is also adapted. Additionally, our research reveals that incorporating pixel value prediction as one of the VLM pre-training tasks and vision encoder adaptation markedly boosts VLM performance on downstream image-language understanding tasks requiring detailed image perception, such as referring image segmentation (with an average +10.19 cIoU improvement) and video game decision making (with average score improvements of +80.34 and +70.54 on two games, respectively).</p></details> |  |
| **[Target Prompting for Information Extraction with Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03834v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent trend in the Large Vision and Language model has brought a new change in how information extraction systems are built. VLMs have set a new benchmark with their State-of-the-art techniques in understanding documents and building question-answering systems across various industries. They are significantly better at generating text from document images and providing accurate answers to questions. However, there are still some challenges in effectively utilizing these models to build a precise conversational system. General prompting techniques used with large language models are often not suitable for these specially designed vision language models. The output generated by such generic input prompts is ordinary and may contain information gaps when compared with the actual content of the document. To obtain more accurate and specific answers, a well-targeted prompt is required by the vision language model, along with the document image. In this paper, a technique is discussed called Target prompting, which focuses on explicitly targeting parts of document images and generating related answers from those specific regions only. The paper also covers the evaluation of response for each prompting technique using different user queries and input prompts.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

We propose an approach that appends first names to ethically annotated text scenarios to reveal demographic biases in model outputs. Our study involves a curated list of more than 300 names representing diverse genders and ethnic backgrounds, tested across thousands of moral scenarios. Following the auditing methodologies from social sciences we propose a detailed analysis involving popular LLMs/VLMs to contribute to the field of responsible AI by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and mitigating biases in these systems. Furthermore, we introduce a novel benchmark, the Pratical Scenarios Benchmark (PSB), designed to assess the presence of biases involving gender or demographic prejudices in everyday decision-making scenarios as well as practical scenarios where an LLM might be used to make sensible decisions (e.g., granting mortgages or insurances). This benchmark allows for a comprehensive comparison of model behaviors across different demographic categories, highlighting the risks and biases that may arise in practical applications of LLMs and VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV workshop FAILED</p></details> |

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Openstory++: A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Instance-aware Open-domain Visual Storytelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03695v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generation models excel at creating high-quality images from brief captions. However, they fail to maintain consistency of multiple instances across images when encountering lengthy contexts. This inconsistency is largely due to in existing training datasets the absence of granular instance feature labeling in existing training datasets. To tackle these issues, we introduce Openstory++, a large-scale dataset combining additional instance-level annotations with both images and text. Furthermore, we develop a training methodology that emphasizes entity-centric image-text generation, ensuring that the models learn to effectively interweave visual and textual information. Specifically, Openstory++ streamlines the process of keyframe extraction from open-domain videos, employing vision-language models to generate captions that are then polished by a large language model for narrative continuity. It surpasses previous datasets by offering a more expansive open-domain resource, which incorporates automated captioning, high-resolution imagery tailored for instance count, and extensive frame sequences for temporal consistency. Additionally, we present Cohere-Bench, a pioneering benchmark framework for evaluating the image generation tasks when long multimodal context is provided, including the ability to keep the background, style, instances in the given context coherent. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work fills critical gaps in multi-modal generation, propelling the development of models that can adeptly generate and interpret complex narratives in open-domain environments. Experiments conducted within Cohere-Bench confirm the superiority of Openstory++ in nurturing high-quality visual storytelling models, enhancing their ability to address open-domain generation tasks.

While pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive performance on various vision tasks, their potential for ordinal regression has received less exploration. In this study, we first investigate CLIP's potential for ordinal regression, from which we expect the model could generalise to different ordinal regression tasks and scenarios. Unfortunately, vanilla CLIP fails on this task, since current VLMs have a well-documented limitation of encapsulating compositional concepts such as number sense. We propose a simple yet effective method called NumCLIP to improve the quantitative understanding of VLMs. We disassemble the exact image to number-specific text matching problem into coarse classification and fine prediction stages. We discretize and phrase each numerical bin with common language concept to better leverage the available pre-trained alignment in CLIP. To consider the inherent continuous property of ordinal regression, we propose a novel fine-grained cross-modal ranking-based regularisation loss specifically designed to keep both semantic and ordinal alignment in CLIP's feature space. Experimental results on three general ordinal regression tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NumCLIP, with 10% and 3.83% accuracy improvement on historical image dating and image aesthetics assessment task, respectively.

To obtain these category-specific prompts, the present methods rely on hand-crafting the prompts to the LLMs for generating VLM prompts for the downstream tasks. However, this requires manually composing these task-specific prompts and still, they might not cover the diverse set of visual concepts and task-specific styles associated with the categories of interest. To effectively take humans out of the loop and completely automate the prompt generation process for zero-shot recognition, we propose Meta-Prompting for Visual Recognition (MPVR). Taking as input only minimal information about the target task, in the form of its short natural language description, and a list of associated class labels, MPVR automatically produces a diverse set of category-specific prompts resulting in a strong zero-shot classifier. MPVR generalizes effectively across various popular zero-shot image recognition benchmarks belonging to widely different domains when tested with multiple LLMs and VLMs. For example, MPVR obtains a zero-shot recognition improvement over CLIP by up to 19.8% and 18.2% (5.0% and 4.5% on average over 20 datasets) leveraging GPT and Mixtral LLMs, respectively</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV Camera Ready.

We propose a new VPI method, "goal hijacking via visual prompt injection" (GHVPI), that swaps the execution task of LVLMs from an original task to an alternative task designated by an attacker. The quantitative analysis indicates that GPT-4V is vulnerable to the GHVPI and demonstrates a notable attack success rate of 15.8%, which is an unignorable security risk. Our analysis also shows that successful GHVPI requires high character recognition capability and instruction-following ability in LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to NAACL 2024 SRW</p></details> |

While recent surgical AI models have focused on solving task-specific problems, there is a need for general-purpose systems that can understand surgical scenes and interact through natural language. This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical and surgical knowledge with visual scene understanding. For comprehensively evaluating general-purpose surgical models, we propose SurgiQual, which evaluates across medical and surgical knowledge benchmarks as well as surgical vision-language questions. To train GP-VLS, we develop six new datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and vision-language pairs for tasks like phase recognition and tool identification. We show that GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on surgical vision-language tasks, with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks. GP-VLS also demonstrates strong performance on medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives. Overall, GP-VLS provides an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across a wide range of tasks and scenarios.

However, existing multimodal benchmarks focus on primary perception abilities and commonsense knowledge which are insufficient to reflect the comprehensive capabilities of LVLMs. We propose GAOKAO-MM, a multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), comprising of 8 subjects and 12 types of images, such as diagrams, function graphs, maps and photos. GAOKAO-MM derives from native Chinese context and sets human-level requirements for the model's abilities, including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning. We evaluate 10 LVLMs and find that the accuracies of all of them are lower than 50%, with GPT-4-Vison (48.1%), Qwen-VL-Plus (41.2%) and Gemini-Pro-Vision (35.1%) ranking in the top three positions.

The inherent heterogeneity of content within multimodal inputs and outputs presents a significant challenge to the execution of MSMO. Traditional approaches typically adopt a holistic perspective on coarse image-text data or individual visual objects, overlooking the essential connections between objects and the entities they represent. To integrate the fine-grained entity knowledge, we propose an Entity-Guided Multimodal Summarization model (EGMS). Our model, building on BART, utilizes dual multimodal encoders with shared weights to process text-image and entity-image information concurrently. A gating mechanism then combines visual data for enhanced textual summary generation, while image selection is refined through knowledge distillation from a pre-trained vision-language model. Extensive experiments on public MSMO dataset validate the superiority of the EGMS method, which also prove the necessity to incorporate entity information into MSMO problem.</p></details> | In ACL-Findings 2024 |

These programs are complex to use and typically require years of training and experience to master. Structured and well-constrained 2D sketches and 3D constructions are crucial components of CAD modeling. A well-executed CAD model can be seamlessly integrated into the manufacturing process, thereby enhancing production efficiency. Deep generative models of 3D shapes and 3D object reconstruction models have garnered significant research interest. However, most of these models produce discrete forms of 3D objects that are not editable. Moreover, the few models based on CAD operations often have substantial input restrictions. In this work, we fine-tuned pre-trained models to create OpenECAD models (0.55B, 0.89B, 2.4B and 3.1B), leveraging the visual, logical, coding, and general capabilities of visual language models. OpenECAD models can process images of 3D designs as input and generate highly structured 2D sketches and 3D construction commands, ensuring that the designs are editable. These outputs can be directly used with existing CAD tools' APIs to generate project files. To train our network, we created a series of OpenECAD datasets. These datasets are derived from existing public CAD datasets, adjusted and augmented to meet the specific requirements of vision language model (VLM) training. Additionally, we have introduced an approach that utilizes dependency relationships to define and generate sketches, further enriching the content and functionality of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, LVLMs struggle with object hallucinations due to their reliance on text cues and learned object co-occurrence biases. While most research quantifies these hallucinations, mitigation strategies are still lacking. Our study introduces a Language Contrastive Decoding (LCD) algorithm that adjusts LVLM outputs based on LLM distribution confidence levels, effectively reducing object hallucinations. We demonstrate the advantages of LCD in leading LVLMs, showing up to %4 improvement in POPE F1 scores and up to %36 reduction in CHAIR scores on the COCO validation set, while also improving captioning quality scores. Our method effectively improves LVLMs without needing complex post-processing or retraining, and is easily applicable to different models.

However, the insulated nature of training restricts the capability of classical detectors to obtain open-world facts. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have encoded rich world knowledge, they are not inherently tailored for combating fake news and struggle to comprehend local forgery details. In this paper, we propose FKA-Owl, a novel framework that leverages forgery-specific knowledge to augment LVLMs, enabling them to reason about manipulations effectively. The augmented forgery-specific knowledge includes semantic correlation between text and images, and artifact trace in image manipulation. To inject these two kinds of knowledge into the LVLM, we design two specialized modules to establish their representations, respectively. The encoded knowledge embeddings are then incorporated into LVLMs. Extensive experiments on the public benchmark demonstrate that FKA-Owl achieves superior cross-domain performance compared to previous methods.

While most attacks target encoders on the upstream side, it remains unknown how an encoder could be threatened when deployed in a downstream ML service. This paper unveils a new vulnerability: the Pre-trained Encoder Inference (PEI) attack, which posts privacy threats toward encoders hidden behind downstream ML services. By only providing API accesses to a targeted downstream service and a set of candidate encoders, the PEI attack can infer which encoder is secretly used by the targeted service based on candidate ones. We evaluate the attack performance of PEI against real-world encoders on three downstream tasks: image classification, text classification, and text-to-image generation. Experiments show that the PEI attack succeeds in revealing the hidden encoder in most cases and seldom makes mistakes even when the hidden encoder is not in the candidate set. We also conducted a case study on one of the most recent vision-language models, LLaVA, to illustrate that the PEI attack is useful in assisting other ML attacks such as adversarial attacks.

Recent multi-image LVLMs have begun to address this need. However, their evaluation has not kept pace with their development. To fill this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-image Understanding (MMIU) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess LVLMs across a wide range of multi-image tasks. MMIU encompasses 7 types of multi-image relationships, 52 tasks, 77K images, and 11K meticulously curated multiple-choice questions, making it the most extensive benchmark of its kind. Our evaluation of 24 popular LVLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, reveals significant challenges in multi-image comprehension, particularly in tasks involving spatial understanding.

Through multi-faceted analytical experiments, we identify key performance gaps and limitations, providing valuable insights for future model and data improvements.

| **[Enhancing Conceptual Understanding in Multimodal Contrastive Learning through Hard Negative Samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02875v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal models leveraging contrastive learning often face limitations in developing fine-grained conceptual understanding. This is due to random negative samples during pretraining, causing almost exclusively very dissimilar concepts to be compared in the loss function. Consequently, the models struggle with fine-grained semantic differences. To address this problem, we introduce a novel pretraining method incorporating synthetic hard negative text examples. The hard negatives permute terms corresponding to visual concepts, leading to a more fine-grained visual and textual concept alignment. Further, we introduce InpaintCOCO, a new challenging dataset for assessing the fine-grained alignment of colors, objects, and sizes in vision-language models. We created the dataset using generative inpainting from COCO images by changing the visual concepts so that the images no longer match their original captions. Our results show significant improvements in fine-grained concept understanding across a wide range of vision-language datasets, including our InpaintCOCO dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Friendly Vision-Language Model for Minecraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10571v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the essential missions in the AI research community is to build an autonomous embodied agent that can achieve high-level performance across a wide spectrum of tasks. However, acquiring or manually designing rewards for all open-ended tasks is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal contrastive learning framework architecture, CLIP4MC, aiming to learn a reinforcement learning (RL) friendly vision-language model (VLM) that serves as an intrinsic reward function for open-ended tasks. Simply utilizing the similarity between the video snippet and the language prompt is not RL-friendly since standard VLMs may only capture the similarity at a coarse level. To achieve RL-friendliness, we incorporate the task completion degree into the VLM training objective, as this information can assist agents in distinguishing the importance between different states. Moreover, we provide neat YouTube datasets based on the large-scale YouTube database provided by MineDojo. Specifically, two rounds of filtering operations guarantee that the dataset covers enough essential information and that the video-text pair is highly correlated. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance on RL tasks compared with baselines. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/CLIP4MC.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Solving Token Gradient Conflict in Mixture-of-Experts for Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19905v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing attention in studying Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and they usually employ a router to predict the routing of each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization directions of tokens. This may lead to severe optimization interference between different tokens assigned to an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis, i.e., Solving Token Gradient Conflict (STGC). Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. After that, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation on Inconsistent Taxonomy using VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02261v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of semantic segmentation in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) emerges not only from domain shifts between source and target images but also from discrepancies in class taxonomies across domains. Traditional UDA research assumes consistent taxonomy between the source and target domains, thereby limiting their ability to recognize and adapt to the taxonomy of the target domain. This paper introduces a novel approach, Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation on Inconsistent Taxonomy using Vision Language Models (CSI), which effectively performs domain-adaptive semantic segmentation even in situations of source-target class mismatches. CSI leverages the semantic generalization potential of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to create synergy with previous UDA methods. It leverages segment reasoning obtained through traditional UDA methods, combined with the rich semantic knowledge embedded in VLMs, to relabel new classes in the target domain. This approach allows for effective adaptation to extended taxonomies without requiring any ground truth label for the target domain. Our method has shown to be effective across various benchmarks in situations of inconsistent taxonomy settings (coarse-to-fine taxonomy and open taxonomy) and demonstrates consistent synergy effects when integrated with previous state-of-the-art UDA methods. The implementation is available at http://github.com/jkee58/CSI.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

This study evaluates the efficacy of an advanced vision-language foundation model, OWLv2, in detecting and classifying various helmet-wearing statuses of motorcycle occupants using video data. We extend the dataset provided by the CVPR AI City Challenge and employ a cascaded model approach for detection and classification tasks, integrating OWLv2 and CNN models. The results highlight the potential of zero-shot learning to address challenges arising from incomplete and biased training datasets, demonstrating the usage of such models in detecting motorcycles, helmet usage, and occupant positions under varied conditions. We have achieved an average precision of 0.5324 for helmet detection and provided precision-recall curves detailing the detection and classification performance. Despite limitations such as low-resolution data and poor visibility, our research shows promising advancements in automated vehicle safety and traffic safety enforcement systems.</p></details> |  |

However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[ViG-Bias: Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01996v3)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of machine learning models in critical decision making processes has underscored the need for bias discovery and mitigation strategies. Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is not straightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hidden spurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely on bias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroups of data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender or ethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes defining semantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible to know a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visual recognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups by leveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction of cross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions to characterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In this work, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generated via GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such bias discovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce Visually Grounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effective technique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks to improve both, discovery and mitigation performance. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that incorporating visual explanations enhances existing techniques like DOMINO, FACTS and Bias-to-Text, across several challenging datasets, including CelebA, Waterbirds, and NICO++.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Self-Introspective Decoding: Alleviating Hallucinations for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02032v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, the prevalent issue known as the `hallucination' problem has emerged as a significant bottleneck, hindering their real-world deployments. Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaCBM: An Adaptive Concept Bottleneck Model for Explainable and Accurate Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02001v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language models such as CLIP and Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offers a promising approach to explaining deep neural network (DNN) decisions using concepts understandable by humans, addressing the black-box concern of DNNs. While CLIP provides both explainability and zero-shot classification capability, its pre-training on generic image and text data may limit its classification accuracy and applicability to medical image diagnostic tasks, creating a transfer learning problem. To maintain explainability and address transfer learning needs, CBM methods commonly design post-processing modules after the bottleneck module. However, this way has been ineffective. This paper takes an unconventional approach by re-examining the CBM framework through the lens of its geometrical representation as a simple linear classification system. The analysis uncovers that post-CBM fine-tuning modules merely rescale and shift the classification outcome of the system, failing to fully leverage the system's learning potential. We introduce an adaptive module strategically positioned between CLIP and CBM to bridge the gap between source and downstream domains. This simple yet effective approach enhances classification performance while preserving the explainability afforded by the framework. Our work offers a comprehensive solution that encompasses the entire process, from concept discovery to model training, providing a holistic recipe for leveraging the strengths of GPT, CLIP, and CBM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024, the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention</p></details> |

However, uncertainty about bias has in some cases limited their adoption and availability. In the present work, we study 43 CLIP vision-language models to determine whether they learn human-like facial impression biases, and we find evidence that such biases are reflected across three distinct CLIP model families. We show for the first time that the the degree to which a bias is shared across a society predicts the degree to which it is reflected in a CLIP model. Human-like impressions of visually unobservable attributes, like trustworthiness and sexuality, emerge only in models trained on the largest dataset, indicating that a better fit to uncurated cultural data results in the reproduction of increasingly subtle social biases. Moreover, we use a hierarchical clustering approach to show that dataset size predicts the extent to which the underlying structure of facial impression bias resembles that of facial impression bias in humans. Finally, we show that Stable Diffusion models employing CLIP as a text encoder learn facial impression biases, and that these biases intersect with racial biases in Stable Diffusion XL-Turbo. While pretrained CLIP models may prove useful for scientific studies of bias, they will also require significant dataset curation when intended for use as general-purpose models in a zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society 2024</p></details> |

To approach this goal, we leverage a vision-language model (VLM) for visual grounding and transfer its vision-language knowledge into reinforcement learning (RL) for object-centric tasks, which makes the agent capable of zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and instructions. By visual grounding, we obtain an object-grounded confidence map for the target object indicated in the instruction. Based on this map, we introduce two routes to transfer VLM knowledge into RL. Firstly, we propose an object-grounded intrinsic reward function derived from the confidence map to more effectively guide the agent towards the target object. Secondly, the confidence map offers a more unified, accessible task representation for the agent's policy, compared to language embeddings. This enables the agent to process unseen objects and instructions through comprehensible visual confidence maps, facilitating zero-shot object-level generalization. Single-task experiments prove that our intrinsic reward significantly improves performance on challenging skill learning. In multi-task experiments, through testing on tasks beyond the training set, we show that the agent, when provided with the confidence map as the task representation, possesses better generalization capabilities than language-based conditioning.

Our approach improves the generalization of large foundation models when fine-tuned on downstream tasks in a few-shot setting. The basic idea of CoPrompt is to enforce a consistency constraint in the prediction of the trainable and pre-trained models to prevent overfitting on the downstream task. Additionally, we introduce the following two components into our consistency constraint to further boost the performance: enforcing consistency on two perturbed inputs and combining two dominant paradigms of tuning, prompting and adapter. Enforcing consistency on perturbed input serves to further regularize the consistency constraint, thereby improving generalization. Moreover, the integration of adapters and prompts not only enhances performance on downstream tasks but also offers increased tuning flexibility in both input and output spaces. This facilitates more effective adaptation to downstream tasks in a few-shot learning setting. Experiments show that CoPrompt outperforms existing methods on a range of evaluation suites, including base-to-novel generalization, domain generalization, and cross-dataset evaluation. On generalization, CoPrompt improves the state-of-the-art on zero-shot tasks and the overall harmonic mean over 11 datasets. Detailed ablation studies show the effectiveness of each of the components in CoPrompt. We make our code available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoPrompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |

To create a high-quality scene, designers usually need to spend hours in software like Blender, in which they might need to interleave and repeat operations, such as connecting material nodes, hundreds of times. Moreover, slightly different design goals may require completely different sequences, making automation difficult. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), like GPT-4V, to intelligently search the design action space to arrive at an answer that can satisfy a user's intent. Specifically, we design a vision-based edit generator and state evaluator to work together to find the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal. Inspired by the role of visual imagination in the human design process, we supplement the visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs with "imagined" reference images from image-generation models, providing visual grounding of abstract language descriptions. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence suggesting our system can produce simple but tedious Blender editing sequences for tasks such as editing procedural materials and geometry from text and/or reference images, as well as adjusting lighting configurations for product renderings in complex scenes.</p></details> |  |

This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096.

LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the MICCAI 2024 Second International Workshop on Foundation Models for General Medical AI</p></details> |

However, these capabilities are built upon training on large amount of uncurated data crawled from the web. The latter may include sensitive information that VLMs could memorize and leak, raising significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we assess whether these vulnerabilities exist, focusing on identity leakage. Our study leads to three key findings: (i) VLMs leak identity information, even when the vision-language alignment and the fine-tuning use anonymized data; (ii) context has little influence on identity leakage; (iii) simple, widely used anonymization techniques, like blurring, are not sufficient to address the problem. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust privacy protection strategies when deploying VLMs. Ethical awareness and responsible development practices are essential to mitigate these risks.</p></details> |  |

However, standard multimodal approaches often assume consistent modalities between training and inference, limiting applications in many real-world use cases, as some modalities may not be available during inference. While existing research mitigates this problem through reconstructing the missing modalities, they unavoidably increase unnecessary computational cost, which could be just as critical, especially for large, deployed infrastructures in industry. To this end, we propose a novel guidance network that promotes knowledge sharing during training, taking advantage of the multimodal representations to train better single-modality models to be used for inference. Real-world experiments in violence detection shows that our proposed framework trains single-modality models that significantly outperform traditionally trained counterparts, while avoiding increases in computational cost for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICME ...</summary><p>ICME 2024 Camera Ready.

Direct inspections and manual annotations are prohibitively expensive at scale. Conventional machine learning methods require substantial annotated training data for adequate performance. In this paper, we consider vision language models as a mechanism for annotating diverse urban features from satellite images, reducing the dependence on human annotation to produce large training sets. While these models have achieved impressive results in describing common objects in images captured from a human perspective, their training sets are less likely to include strong signals for esoteric features in the built environment, and their performance in these settings is therefore unclear. We demonstrate proof-of-concept combining a state-of-the-art vision language model and variants of a prompting strategy that asks the model to consider segmented elements independently of the original image. Experiments on two urban features -- stop lines and raised tables -- show that while direct zero-shot prompting correctly annotates nearly zero images, the pre-segmentation strategies can annotate images with near 40% intersection-over-union accuracy. We describe how these results inform a new research agenda in automatic annotation of the built environment to improve equity, accessibility, and safety at broad scale and in diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

This raises an urgent need to carefully analyse their robustness so that stakeholders can understand if and when such models are trustworthy enough to be relied upon in any given application. In this paper, we highlight a specific vulnerability in popular models, namely permutation sensitivity in multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist in very recent language and vision-language models.

Typical solutions involve either freezing CLIP during training to unilaterally maintain its zero-shot capability, or fine-tuning CLIP vision encoder to achieve perceptual sensitivity to local regions. However, few of them incorporate vision-text collaborative optimization. Based on this, we propose the Content-Dependent Transfer to adaptively enhance each text embedding by interacting with the input image, which presents a parameter-efficient way to optimize the text representation. Besides, we additionally introduce a Representation Compensation strategy, reviewing the original CLIP-V representation as compensation to maintain the zero-shot capability of CLIP. In this way, the vision and text representation of CLIP are optimized collaboratively, enhancing the alignment of the vision-text feature space. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to establish the collaborative vision-text optimizing mechanism within the OVS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior performance on popular OVS benchmarks. In open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches by +0.5, +2.3, +3.4, +0.4 and +1.1 mIoU, respectively on A-847, A-150, PC-459, PC-59 and PAS-20.

Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full-spectrum, actionable coaching -- expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and the first-of-its-kind expert pose generation -- outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Are Bigger Encoders Always Better in Vision Large Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00620v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential in real-world applications. They are developing rapidly due to their remarkable ability to comprehend multimodal information and their inherent powerful cognitive and reasoning capabilities. Among MLLMs, vision language models (VLM) stand out for their ability to understand vision information. However, the scaling trend of VLMs under the current mainstream paradigm has not been extensively studied. Whether we can achieve better performance by training even larger models is still unclear. To address this issue, we conducted experiments on the pretraining stage of MLLMs. We conduct our experiment using different encoder sizes and large language model (LLM) sizes. Our findings indicate that merely increasing the size of encoders does not necessarily enhance the performance of VLMs. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of LLM backbone parameter size and data quality on the pretraining outcomes. Additionally, we explored the differences in scaling laws between LLMs and VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models with Active Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00555v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in image comprehension, these models frequently generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination.Recently, in large language models (LLMs), augmenting LLMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources has been proven as a promising solution to mitigate hallucinations.However, the retrieval augmentation in LVLM significantly lags behind the widespread applications of LVLM. Moreover, when transferred to augmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even exacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we introduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large vision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by incorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets based on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the most effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval results. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low certainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high certainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing hallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and mPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks. Our empirical observations suggest that by utilizing fitting retrieval mechanisms and timing the retrieval judiciously, we can effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the retrieval augmentation to LVLMs for reducing hallucinations with more effective retrieval and minimal retrieval occurrences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Multilingual Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00550v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they suffer from hallucination problems, where models generate plausible yet incorrect answers given the input image-query pair. This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/ssmisya/MHR</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models with LLM-Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00523v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have significantly improved automated task-solving capabilities using autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs). However, most LLM-based agents focus on dialogue, programming, or specialized domains, leaving gaps in addressing generative AI safety tasks. These gaps are primarily due to the challenges posed by LLM hallucinations and the lack of clear guidelines. In this paper, we propose Atlas, an advanced LLM-based multi-agent framework that integrates an efficient fuzzing workflow to target generative AI models, specifically focusing on jailbreak attacks against text-to-image (T2I) models with safety filters. Atlas utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) to assess whether a prompt triggers the T2I model's safety filter. It then iteratively collaborates with both LLM and VLM to generate an alternative prompt that bypasses the filter. Atlas also enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs in attack scenarios by leveraging multi-agent communication, in-context learning (ICL) memory mechanisms, and the chain-of-thought (COT) approach. Our evaluation demonstrates that Atlas successfully jailbreaks several state-of-the-art T2I models in a black-box setting, which are equipped with multi-modal safety filters. In addition, Atlas outperforms existing methods in both query efficiency and the quality of the generated images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending Jailbreak Attack in VLMs via Cross-modality Information Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21659v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend the capacity of LLMs to comprehensively understand vision information, achieving remarkable performance in many vision-centric tasks. Despite that, recent studies have shown that these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which refer to an exploitative technique where malicious users can break the safety alignment of the target model and generate misleading and harmful answers. This potential threat is caused by both the inherent vulnerabilities of LLM and the larger attack scope introduced by vision input. To enhance the security of VLMs against jailbreak attacks, researchers have developed various defense techniques. However, these methods either require modifications to the model's internal structure or demand significant computational resources during the inference phase. Multimodal information is a double-edged sword. While it increases the risk of attacks, it also provides additional data that can enhance safeguards. Inspired by this, we propose $\underline{\textbf{C}}$ross-modality $\underline{\textbf{I}}$nformation $\underline{\textbf{DE}}$tecto$\underline{\textbf{R}}$ ($\textit{CIDER})$, a plug-and-play jailbreaking detector designed to identify maliciously perturbed image inputs, utilizing the cross-modal similarity between harmful queries and adversarial images. This simple yet effective cross-modality information detector, $\textit{CIDER}$, is independent of the target VLMs and requires less computation cost. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of $\textit{CIDER}$, as well as its transferability to both white-box and black-box VLMs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we propose DECIDER (Debiasing Classifiers to Identify Errors Reliably), a novel approach that leverages priors from large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to detect failures in image classification models. DECIDER utilizes LLMs to specify task-relevant core attributes and constructs a ``debiased'' version of the classifier by aligning its visual features to these core attributes using a VLM, and detects potential failure by measuring disagreement between the original and debiased models. In addition to proactively identifying samples on which the model would fail, DECIDER also provides human-interpretable explanations for failure through a novel attribute-ablation strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks spanning subpopulation shifts (spurious correlations, class imbalance) and covariate shifts (synthetic corruptions, domain shifts), DECIDER consistently achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance, significantly outperforming baselines in terms of the overall Matthews correlation coefficient as well as failure and success recall.

| **[Open-Set Video-based Facial Expression Recognition with Human Expression-sensitive Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17100v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (V-FER), models are typically trained on closed-set datasets with a fixed number of known classes. However, these models struggle with unknown classes common in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a challenging Open-set Video-based Facial Expression Recognition (OV-FER) task, aiming to identify both known and new, unseen facial expressions. While existing approaches use large-scale vision-language models like CLIP to identify unseen classes, we argue that these methods may not adequately capture the subtle human expressions needed for OV-FER. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Human Expression-Sensitive Prompting (HESP) mechanism to significantly enhance CLIP's ability to model video-based facial expression details effectively. Our proposed HESP comprises three components: 1) a textual prompting module with learnable prompts to enhance CLIP's textual representation of both known and unknown emotions, 2) a visual prompting module that encodes temporal emotional information from video frames using expression-sensitive attention, equipping CLIP with a new visual modeling ability to extract emotion-rich information, and 3) an open-set multi-task learning scheme that promotes interaction between the textual and visual modules, improving the understanding of novel human emotions in video sequences. Extensive experiments conducted on four OV-FER task settings demonstrate that HESP can significantly boost CLIP's performance (a relative improvement of 17.93% on AUROC and 106.18% on OSCR) and outperform other state-of-the-art open-set video understanding methods by a large margin.

Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels.

| **[OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00203v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the situation when one image is associated with several captions, each caption containing both information shared among all captions and unique information per caption about the scene depicted in the image. In such cases, it is unclear whether contrastive losses are sufficient for learning task-optimal representations that contain all the information provided by the captions or whether the contrastive learning setup encourages the learning of a simple shortcut that minimizes contrastive loss. We introduce synthetic shortcuts for vision-language: a training and evaluation framework where we inject synthetic shortcuts into image-text data. We show that contrastive VLMs trained from scratch or fine-tuned with data containing these synthetic shortcuts mainly learn features that represent the shortcut. Hence, contrastive losses are not sufficient to learn task-optimal representations, i.e., representations that contain all task-relevant information shared between the image and associated captions. We examine two methods to reduce shortcut learning in our training and evaluation framework: (i) latent target decoding and (ii) implicit feature modification. We show empirically that both methods improve performance on the evaluation task, but only partly reduce shortcut learning when training and evaluating with our shortcut learning framework. Hence, we show the difficulty and challenge of our shortcut learning framework for contrastive vision-language representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, accepted at TMLR</p></details> |

Meanwhile, several other problems are closely related to OOD detection, including anomaly detection (AD), novelty detection (ND), open set recognition (OSR), and outlier detection (OD). To unify these problems, a generalized OOD detection framework was proposed, taxonomically categorizing these five problems. However, Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have significantly changed the paradigm and blurred the boundaries between these fields, again confusing researchers. In this survey, we first present a generalized OOD detection v2, encapsulating the evolution of AD, ND, OSR, OOD detection, and OD in the VLM era. Our framework reveals that, with some field inactivity and integration, the demanding challenges have become OOD detection and AD. In addition, we also highlight the significant shift in the definition, problem settings, and benchmarks; we thus feature a comprehensive review of the methodology for OOD detection, including the discussion over other related tasks to clarify their relationship to OOD detection.

Deep learning based approaches often face skepticism from forensic document examiners due to their lack of explainability and reliance on extensive training data and handcrafted features. This paper explores using Vision Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's PaliGemma, to address these challenges. By leveraging their Visual Question Answering capabilities and 0-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, our goal is to provide clear, human-understandable explanations for model decisions. Our experiments on the CEDAR handwriting dataset demonstrate that VLMs offer enhanced interpretability, reduce the need for large training datasets, and adapt better to diverse handwriting styles. However, results show that the CNN-based ResNet-18 architecture outperforms the 0-shot CoT prompt engineering approach with GPT-4o (Accuracy: 70%) and supervised fine-tuned PaliGemma (Accuracy: 71%), achieving an accuracy of 84% on the CEDAR AND dataset. These findings highlight the potential of VLMs in generating human-interpretable decisions while underscoring the need for further advancements to match the performance of specialized deep learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 Pag...</summary><p>4 Pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table, Accepted as Short paper at Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing (IMVIP) Conference</p></details> |
| **[Paying More Attention to Image: A Training-Free Method for Alleviating Hallucination in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21771v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities. However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension. This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory. Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text. We refer to this phenomenon as "text inertia." To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference. Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements. Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs. By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs. Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.

| **[Open-Vocabulary Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21721v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) aims to segment and classify sounding objects in videos with acoustic cues. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption and only identify pre-defined categories from training data, lacking the generalization ability to detect novel categories in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a new task: open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, extending AVSS task to open-world scenarios beyond the annotated label space. This is a more challenging task that requires recognizing all categories, even those that have never been seen nor heard during training. Moreover, we propose the first open-vocabulary AVSS framework, OV-AVSS, which mainly consists of two parts: 1) a universal sound source localization module to perform audio-visual fusion and locate all potential sounding objects and 2) an open-vocabulary classification module to predict categories with the help of the prior knowledge from large-scale pre-trained vision-language models. To properly evaluate the open-vocabulary AVSS, we split zero-shot training and testing subsets based on the AVSBench-semantic benchmark, namely AVSBench-OV. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability of our model on all categories. On the AVSBench-OV dataset, OV-AVSS achieves 55.43% mIoU on base categories and 29.14% mIoU on novel categories, exceeding the state-of-the-art zero-shot method by 41.88%/20.61% and open-vocabulary method by 10.2%/11.6%.

These methods typically aim for pixel-level vision-language alignment, but often rely on low resolution image features from CLIP, resulting in class ambiguities along boundaries. Moreover, the global scene representations in CLIP text embeddings do not directly correlate with the local and detailed pixel-level features, making meaningful alignment more difficult. To address these limitations, we introduce MTA-CLIP, a novel framework employing mask-level vision-language alignment. Specifically, we first propose Mask-Text Decoder that enhances the mask representations using rich textual data with the CLIP language model. Subsequently, it aligns mask representations with text embeddings using Mask-to-Text Contrastive Learning. Furthermore, we introduce MaskText Prompt Learning, utilizing multiple context-specific prompts for text embeddings to capture diverse class representations across masks. Overall, MTA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art, surpassing prior works by an average of 2.8% and 1.3% on on standard benchmark datasets, ADE20k and Cityscapes, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

We employ the text embeddings as object queries within a transformer-based segmentation framework (textual object queries). These queries are regarded as a domain-invariant basis for pixel grouping in DGSS. To leverage the power of textual object queries, we introduce a novel framework named the textual query-driven mask transformer (tqdm). Our tqdm aims to (1) generate textual object queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics and (2) enhance the semantic clarity of dense visual features. Additionally, we suggest three regularization losses to improve the efficacy of tqdm by aligning between visual and textual features. By utilizing our method, the model can comprehend inherent semantic information for classes of interest, enabling it to generalize to extreme domains (e.g., sketch style). Our tqdm achieves 68.9 mIoU on GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art method by 2.5 mIoU.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

However, due to the domain gap between VLM and vision-detection tasks, pseudo-labels produced by the VLMs are prone to be noisy, while the training design of the detector further amplifies the bias. In this work, we investigate the root cause of VLMs' biased prediction under the OVD context. Our observations lead to a simple yet effective paradigm, coded MarvelOVD, that generates significantly better training targets and optimizes the learning procedure in an online manner by marrying the capability of the detector with the vision-language model. Our key insight is that the detector itself can act as a strong auxiliary guidance to accommodate VLM's inability of understanding both the ``background'' and the context of a proposal within the image. Based on it, we greatly purify the noisy pseudo-labels via Online Mining and propose Adaptive Reweighting to effectively suppress the biased training boxes that are not well aligned with the target object. In addition, we also identify a neglected ``base-novel-conflict'' problem and introduce stratified label assignments to prevent it. Extensive experiments on COCO and LVIS datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the other state-of-the-arts by significant margins.

Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p></details> |  |

Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption. Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view. We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data. Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball). Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect. Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results. Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%. Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave. The dataset and all code will be open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
| **[Fluence compensation for real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09572v1)** | 2020-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently we demonstrated an integrated photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (PAUS) system using a kHz-rate wavelength-tunable laser and a swept-beam delivery approach. It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Y-Net: A Hybrid Deep Learning Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Imaging in vivo](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00975v1)** | 2019-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging non-invasive imaging modality combining the advantages of deep ultrasound penetration and high optical contrast. Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Photoacoustic imaging beyond the acoustic diffraction-limit with dynamic speckle illumination and sparse joint support recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08278v2)** | 2019-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging the spatial resolution is inherently limited by the acoustic wavelength. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

| **[FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11811v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability in news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first framework for news recommendation that leverages the capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering. This system incorporates a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process, enhancing the LLM-based recommender's ability to align news content with user preferences and interests more effectively. Moreover, this study offers insights into the effective use of LLMs in news recommendation, emphasizing both the advantages and the challenges of incorporating LLMs into recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, and 8 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Base Station Siting: Intelligent Deployment based on Prompt or Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03631v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Dual Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21633v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) seeks to enable dialogue systems to transition to unfamiliar domains without manual annotation or extensive retraining. Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings. Our code is accessible at: \url{https://github.com/suntea233/DualLoRA}.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |
| **[Conditioned Prompt-Optimization for Continual Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21554v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the realism and customization of digital content creation. The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

We present Chemlactica and Chemma, two language models fine-tuned on a novel corpus of 110M molecules with computed properties, totaling 40B tokens. These models demonstrate strong performance in generating molecules with specified properties and predicting new molecular characteristics from limited samples. We introduce a novel optimization algorithm that leverages our language models to optimize molecules for arbitrary properties given limited access to a black box oracle. Our approach combines ideas from genetic algorithms, rejection sampling, and prompt optimization. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple molecular optimization benchmarks, including an 8% improvement on Practical Molecular Optimization compared to previous methods. We publicly release the training corpus, the language models and the optimization algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16686v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |
| **[Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16370v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate the performance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Two Great Steps that Work Better Together](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly taking the form of multi-stage pipelines involving multiple distinct language models (LMs) and prompting strategies. Here we address the question of how to fine-tune such systems to improve their performance. We cast this as a problem of optimizing the underlying LM weights and the prompting strategies together, and consider a challenging but highly realistic scenario in which we have no gold labels for any intermediate stages in the pipeline. To address this challenge, we evaluate approximate optimization strategies in which we bootstrap training labels for all pipeline stages and use these to optimize the pipeline's prompts and fine-tune its weights alternatingly. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification, we find that simple approaches for optimizing the prompts and weights together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 65% and 5%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks. We will release our new optimizers in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> |  |

However, no inquiry has yet been made on the impact of prompt selection on labelling accuracy.

While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |

In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy.

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |

While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data.

Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |

Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models Against Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13954v3)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant ability in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |
| **[GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02408v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 Main Track |

Typically, they learn a very small scale of parameters for pre-trained models in a white-box formulation, which assumes model architectures to be known and parameters to be accessible. However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods.

In this work, we propose UniDCP, a Unified medical vision-language model with Dynamic Cross-modal learnable Prompts, which can be plastically applied to multiple medical vision-language tasks. Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Factual Knowledge Probing in Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16570v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on vast unlabeled data, rich in world knowledge. This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |
| **[Joint Prompt Optimization of Stacked LLMs using Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12509v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be seen as atomic units of computation mapping sequences to a distribution over sequences. Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[A Bayesian approach for prompt optimization in pre-trained language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00471v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary according to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a 'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a good performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the tradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
