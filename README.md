| **[Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |
| **[TimeCMA: Towards LLM-Empowered Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01638v4)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to learn temporal dynamics among variables to forecast future time series. Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, ``the best of two worlds'', from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |
| **[QuLTSF: Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Quantum Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13769v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) involves predicting a large number of future values of a time series based on the past values and is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis, disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for conference publication</p></details> |
| **[Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672v4)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchorInv: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning of Physiological Signals via Representation Space Guided Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13714v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in a variety of real-world applications. These successes are often attributed to strong base models that can generalize to novel tasks with limited supporting data while keeping prior knowledge intact. However, these impressive results are based on the availability of a large amount of high-quality data, which is often lacking in specialized biomedical applications. In such fields, models are usually developed with limited data that arrive incrementally with novel categories. This requires the model to adapt to new information while preserving existing knowledge. Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods offer a promising approach to addressing these challenges, but they also depend on strong base models that face the same aforementioned limitations. To overcome these constraints, we propose AnchorInv following the straightforward and efficient buffer-replay strategy. Instead of selecting and storing raw data, AnchorInv generates synthetic samples guided by anchor points in the feature space. This approach protects privacy and regularizes the model for adaptation. When evaluated on three public physiological time series datasets, AnchorInv exhibits efficient knowledge forgetting prevention and improved adaptation to novel classes, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25 Extended Version</p></details> |
| **[PreMixer: MLP-Based Pre-training Enhanced MLP-Mixers for Large-scale Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13607v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In urban computing, precise and swift forecasting of multivariate time series data from traffic networks is crucial. This data incorporates additional spatial contexts such as sensor placements and road network layouts, and exhibits complex temporal patterns that amplify challenges for predictive learning in traffic management, smart mobility demand, and urban planning. Consequently, there is an increasing need to forecast traffic flow across broader geographic regions and for higher temporal coverage. However, current research encounters limitations because of the inherent inefficiency of model and their unsuitability for large-scale traffic network applications due to model complexity. This paper proposes a novel framework, named PreMixer, designed to bridge this gap. It features a predictive model and a pre-training mechanism, both based on the principles of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The PreMixer comprehensively consider temporal dependencies of traffic patterns in different time windows and processes the spatial dynamics as well. Additionally, we integrate spatio-temporal positional encoding to manage spatiotemporal heterogeneity without relying on predefined graphs. Furthermore, our innovative pre-training model uses a simple patch-wise MLP to conduct masked time series modeling, learning from long-term historical data segmented into patches to generate enriched contextual representations. This approach enhances the downstream forecasting model without incurring significant time consumption or computational resource demands owing to improved learning efficiency and data handling flexibility. Our framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high computational efficiency, as verified by extensive experiments on large-scale traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous time series. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on multiple time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), and is further enhanced by deftly designed position embeddings for the temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for large time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Umaruchain/LLMGeovec}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI25 main track</p></details> |
| **[RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TKAN: Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07344v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have revolutionized many areas of machine learning, particularly in natural language and data sequence processing. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Interpretation of Machine Learning Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13076v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning predictions are typically interpreted as the sum of contributions of predictors. Yet, each out-of-sample prediction can also be expressed as a linear combination of in-sample values of the predicted variable, with weights corresponding to pairwise proximity scores between current and past economic events. While this dual route leads nowhere in some contexts (e.g., large cross-sectional datasets), it provides sparser interpretations in settings with many regressors and little training data-like macroeconomic forecasting. In this case, the sequence of contributions can be visualized as a time series, allowing analysts to explain predictions as quantifiable combinations of historical analogies. Moreover, the weights can be viewed as those of a data portfolio, inspiring new diagnostic measures such as forecast concentration, short position, and turnover. We show how weights can be retrieved seamlessly for (kernel) ridge regression, random forest, boosted trees, and neural networks. Then, we apply these tools to analyze post-pandemic forecasts of inflation, GDP growth, and recession probabilities. In all cases, the approach opens the black box from a new angle and demonstrates how machine learning models leverage history partly repeating itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Temporal Vadalog System: Temporal Datalog-based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13019v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the wake of the recent resurgence of the Datalog language of databases, together with its extensions for ontological reasoning settings, this work aims to bridge the gap between the theoretical studies of DatalogMTL (Datalog extended with metric temporal logic) and the development of production-ready reasoning systems. In particular, we lay out the functional and architectural desiderata of a modern reasoner and propose our system, Temporal Vadalog. Leveraging the vast amount of experience from the database community, we go beyond the typical chase-based implementations of reasoners, and propose a set of novel techniques and a system that adopts a modern data pipeline architecture. We discuss crucial architectural choices, such as how to guarantee termination when infinitely many time intervals are possibly generated, how to merge intervals, and how to sustain a limited memory footprint. We discuss advanced features of the system, such as the support for time series, and present an extensive experimental evaluation. This paper is a substantially extended version of "The Temporal Vadalog System" as presented at RuleML+RR '22. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</p></details> |  |
| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Content-aware Balanced Spectrum Encoding in Masked Modeling for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13232v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the superior ability of global dependency, transformer and its variants have become the primary choice in Masked Time-series Modeling (MTM) towards time-series classification task. In this paper, we experimentally analyze that existing transformer-based MTM methods encounter with two under-explored issues when dealing with time series data: (1) they encode features by performing long-dependency ensemble averaging, which easily results in rank collapse and feature homogenization as the layer goes deeper; (2) they exhibit distinct priorities in fitting different frequency components contained in the time-series, inevitably leading to spectrum energy imbalance of encoded feature. To tackle these issues, we propose an auxiliary content-aware balanced decoder (CBD) to optimize the encoding quality in the spectrum space within masked modeling scheme. Specifically, the CBD iterates on a series of fundamental blocks, and thanks to two tailored units, each block could progressively refine the masked representation via adjusting the interaction pattern based on local content variations of time-series and learning to recalibrate the energy distribution across different frequency components. Moreover, a dual-constraint loss is devised to enhance the mutual optimization of vanilla decoder and our CBD. Extensive experimental results on ten time-series classification datasets show that our method nearly surpasses a bunch of baselines. Meanwhile, a series of explanatory results are showcased to sufficiently demystify the behaviors of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Accepted by AAAI 25</p></details> |
| **[TimeCHEAT: A Channel Harmony Strategy for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12886v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled multivariate time series (ISMTS) are prevalent in reality. Due to their non-uniform intervals between successive observations and varying sampling rates among series, the channel-independent (CI) strategy, which has been demonstrated more desirable for complete multivariate time series forecasting in recent studies, has failed. This failure can be further attributed to the sampling sparsity, which provides insufficient information for effective CI learning, thereby reducing its capacity. When we resort to the channel-dependent (CD) strategy, even higher capacity cannot mitigate the potential loss of diversity in learning similar embedding patterns across different channels. We find that existing work considers CI and CD strategies to be mutually exclusive, primarily because they apply these strategies to the global channel. However, we hold the view that channel strategies do not necessarily have to be used globally. Instead, by appropriately applying them locally and globally, we can create an opportunity to take full advantage of both strategies. This leads us to introduce the Channel Harmony ISMTS Transformer (TimeCHEAT), which utilizes the CD locally and the CI globally. Specifically, we segment the ISMTS into sub-series level patches. Locally, the CD strategy aggregates information within each patch for time embedding learning, maximizing the use of relevant observations while reducing long-range irrelevant interference. Here, we enhance generality by transforming embedding learning into an edge weight prediction task using bipartite graphs, eliminating the need for special prior knowledge. Globally, the CI strategy is applied across patches, allowing the Transformer to learn individualized attention patterns for each channel. Experimental results indicate our proposed TimeCHEAT demonstrates competitive SOTA performance across three mainstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Comparative Study of Pruning Methods in Transformer-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12883v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current landscape in time-series forecasting is dominated by Transformer-based models. Their high parameter count and corresponding demand in computational resources pose a challenge to real-world deployment, especially for commercial and scientific applications with low-power embedded devices. Pruning is an established approach to reduce neural network parameter count and save compute. However, the implications and benefits of pruning Transformer-based models for time series forecasting are largely unknown. To close this gap, we provide a comparative benchmark study by evaluating unstructured and structured pruning on various state-of-the-art multivariate time series models. We study the effects of these pruning strategies on model predictive performance and computational aspects like model size, operations, and inference time. Our results show that certain models can be pruned even up to high sparsity levels, outperforming their dense counterpart. However, fine-tuning pruned models is necessary. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even with corresponding hardware and software support, structured pruning is unable to provide significant time savings.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology</p></details> |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Capability of Time-Series Foundation Models in Short-Term Load Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12834v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction on Quantifying Uncertainty of Dynamic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10459v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous studies have focused on learning and understanding the dynamics of physical systems from video data, such as spatial intelligence. Artificial intelligence requires quantitative assessments of the uncertainty of the model to ensure reliability. However, there is still a relative lack of systematic assessment of the uncertainties, particularly the uncertainties of the physical data. Our motivation is to introduce conformal prediction into the uncertainty assessment of dynamical systems, providing a method supported by theoretical guarantees. This paper uses the conformal prediction method to assess uncertainties with benchmark operator learning methods. We have also compared the Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensemble methods in the partial differential equations dataset, effectively evaluating uncertainty through straight roll-outs, making it ideal for time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Temporal Dependencies within the Target for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04777v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in LTSF research, we identify a performance bottleneck in existing LTSF methods caused by the inadequate modeling of Temporal Dependencies within the Target (TDT). To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic temporal modeling framework, Temporal Dependency Alignment (TDAlign), that equips existing LTSF methods with TDT learning capabilities. TDAlign introduces two key innovations: 1) a loss function that aligns the change values between adjacent time steps in the predictions with those in the target, ensuring consistency with variation patterns, and 2) an adaptive loss balancing strategy that seamlessly integrates the new loss function with existing LTSF methods without introducing additional learnable parameters. As a plug-and-play framework, TDAlign enhances existing methods with minimal computational overhead, featuring only linear time complexity and constant space complexity relative to the prediction length. Extensive experiments on six strong LTSF baselines across seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TDAlign. On average, TDAlign reduces baseline prediction errors by \textbf{1.47\%} to \textbf{9.19\%} and change value errors by \textbf{4.57\%} to \textbf{15.78\%}, highlighting its substantial performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSformer: Combining Channel Independence and Mixing for Robust Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06220v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of multivariate time series analysis, the concept of channel independence has been increasingly adopted, demonstrating excellent performance due to its ability to eliminate noise and the influence of irrelevant variables. However, such a concept often simplifies the complex interactions among channels, potentially leading to information loss. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy of channel independence followed by mixing. Based on this strategy, we introduce CSformer, a novel framework featuring a two-stage multiheaded self-attention mechanism. This mechanism is designed to extract and integrate both channel-specific and sequence-specific information. Distinctively, CSformer employs parameter sharing to enhance the cooperative effects between these two types of information. Moreover, our framework effectively incorporates sequence and channel adapters, significantly improving the model's ability to identify important information across various dimensions. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that CSformer achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

We extend the ideas introduced in the paper Trading with the Momentum Transformer: An Intelligent and Interpretable Architecture to equities as the original paper primarily only builds upon futures and equity indices. Unlike conventional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which operate sequentially and are optimized for processing local patterns, an attention mechanism equips our architecture with direct access to all prior time steps in the training window. This hybrid design, combining attention with an LSTM, enables the model to capture long-term dependencies, enhance performance in scenarios accounting for transaction costs, and seamlessly adapt to evolving market conditions, such as those witnessed during the Covid Pandemic. We average 4.14% returns which is similar to the original papers results. Our Sharpe is lower at an average of 1.12 due to much higher volatility which may be due to stocks being inherently more volatile than futures and indices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

This approach enhances expressive power while balancing computational demands, addressing critical limitations of existing techniques. We demonstrate DualDynamics' effectiveness across diverse tasks: classification of robustness to dataset shift, irregularly-sampled series, interpolation of missing data, and forecasting with partial observations. Our results show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, indicating DualDynamics' potential to advance irregular time series analysis significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GG-SSMs: Graph-Generating State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12423v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data in computer vision and time series analysis domains. However, traditional SSMs are limited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their ability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods like Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies, they rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex dependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing graphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust feature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently modeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets, including event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow estimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant margins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet, outperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and improving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships significantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a versatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Deep-learning-based identification of individual motion characteristics from upper-limb trajectories towards disorder stage evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12016v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of individual movement characteristics sets the foundation for the assessment of personal rehabilitation progress and can provide diagnostic information on levels and stages of movement disorders. This work presents a preliminary study for differentiating individual motion patterns using a dataset of 3D upper-limb transport trajectories measured in task-space. Identifying individuals by deep time series learning can be a key step to abstracting individual motion properties. In this study, a classification accuracy of about 95% is reached for a subset of nine, and about 78% for the full set of 31 individuals. This provides insights into the separability of patient attributes by exerting a simple standardized task to be transferred to portable systems.</p></details> |  |

Since first-principles models of environmental noise and dissipation in real quantum systems are often unavailable, deriving accurate models from measured time-series data is critical. However, identifying open quantum systems poses significant challenges: powerful methods from systems engineering can perform poorly beyond weak damping (as we show) because they fail to incorporate essential constraints required for quantum evolution (e.g., positivity). Common methods that can include these constraints are typically multi-step, fitting linear models to physically grounded master equations, often resulting in non-convex functions in which local optimization algorithms get stuck in local extrema (as we show). In this work, we solve these problems by formulating quantum system identification directly from data as a polynomial optimization problem, enabling the use of recently developed global optimization methods. These methods are essentially guaranteed to reach global optima, allowing us for the first time to efficiently obtain the most accurate Markovian model for a given system. In addition to its practical importance, this allows us to take the error of these Markovian models as an alternative (operational) measure of the non-Markovianity of a system. We test our method with the spin-boson model -- a two-level system coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators -- for which we obtain the exact evolution using matrix-product-state techniques. We show that polynomial optimization using moment/sum-of-squares approaches significantly outperforms traditional optimization algorithms, and we show that even for strong damping Lindblad-form master equations can provide accurate models of the spin-boson system.</p></details> | <details><summary>signi...</summary><p>significantly updated manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning for Hydroelectric Optimization: Generating Long-Term River Discharge Scenarios with Ensemble Forecasts from Global Circulation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12234v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydroelectric power generation is a critical component of the global energy matrix, particularly in countries like Brazil, where it represents the majority of the energy supply. However, its strong dependence on river discharges, which are inherently uncertain due to climate variability, poses significant challenges. River discharges are linked to precipitation patterns, making the development of accurate probabilistic forecasting models crucial for improving operational planning in systems heavily reliant on this resource. Traditionally, statistical models have been used to represent river discharges in energy optimization. Yet, these models are increasingly unable to produce realistic scenarios due to structural shifts in climate behavior. Changes in precipitation patterns have altered discharge dynamics, which traditional approaches struggle to capture. Machine learning methods, while effective as universal predictors for time series, often focus solely on historical data, ignoring key external factors such as meteorological and climatic conditions. Furthermore, these methods typically lack a probabilistic framework, which is vital for representing the inherent variability of hydrological processes. The limited availability of historical discharge data further complicates the application of large-scale deep learning models to this domain. To address these challenges, we propose a framework based on a modified recurrent neural network architecture. This model generates parameterized probability distributions conditioned on projections from global circulation models, effectively accounting for the stochastic nature of river discharges. Additionally, the architecture incorporates enhancements to improve its generalization capabilities. We validate this framework within the Brazilian Interconnected System, using projections from the SEAS5-ECMWF system as conditional variables.</p></details> | 11 pages, 15 figures |

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 18 figures. v3: minor typos fixed</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal Persistence Landscapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11925v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A method to apply and visualize persistent homology of time series is proposed. The method captures persistent features in space and time, in contrast to the existing procedures, where one usually chooses one while keeping the other fixed. An extended zigzag module that is built from a time series is defined. This module combines ideas from zigzag persistent homology and multiparameter persistent homology. Persistence landscapes are defined for the case of extended zigzag modules using a recent generalization of the rank invariant (Kim, M\'emoli, 2021). This new invariant is called spatiotemporal persistence landscapes. Under certain finiteness assumptions, spatiotemporal persistence landscapes are a family of functions that take values in Lebesgue spaces, endowing the space of persistence landscapes with a distance. Stability of this invariant is shown with respect to an adapted interleaving distance for extended zigzag modules. Being an invariant that takes values in a Banach space, spatiotemporal persistence landscapes can be used for statistical analysis as well as for input to machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

| **[Enhancing Transformer-based models for Long Sequence Time Series Forecasting via Structured Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12462v4)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting have demonstrated promising results. The self-attention mechanism as the core component of these Transformer-based models exhibits great potential in capturing various dependencies among data points. Despite these advancements, it has been a subject of concern to improve the efficiency of the self-attention mechanism. Unfortunately, current specific optimization methods are facing the challenges in applicability and scalability for the future design of long sequence time series forecasting models. Hence, in this article, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer-based models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). The framework reduces both time and space complexity by the replacement of the self-attention and feed-forward layers with SAB and SFB while maintaining their expressive power and architectural advantages. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. The extensive experiments on 10 Transformer-based models across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 12.4%, alongside 61.3% reduction in parameter counts.</p></details> |  |

However, the sensitivity of personal health data raises significant privacy concerns. While user de-identification by removing direct identifiers such as names and addresses is commonly employed to protect privacy, the data itself can still be exploited to re-identify individuals. We introduce a novel framework for similarity-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) re-identification attacks on time series health data. Using the WESAD dataset and two larger synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that even short segments of sensor data can achieve perfect re-identification with our Slicing-DTW-Attack. Our attack is independent of training data and computes similarity rankings in about 2 minutes for 10,000 subjects on a single CPU core. These findings highlight that de-identification alone is insufficient to protect privacy. As a defense, we show that adding random noise to the signals significantly reduces re-identification risk while only moderately affecting usability in stress detection tasks, offering a promising approach to balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (AsiaCCS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal LLM for Intelligent Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11683v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving landscape of transportation systems, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising frontier for advancing intelligent decision-making across various applications. This paper introduces a novel 3-dimensional framework that encapsulates the intersection of applications, machine learning methodologies, and hardware devices, particularly emphasizing the role of LLMs. Instead of using multiple machine learning algorithms, our framework uses a single, data-centric LLM architecture that can analyze time series, images, and videos. We explore how LLMs can enhance data interpretation and decision-making in transportation. We apply this LLM framework to different sensor datasets, including time-series data and visual data from sources like Oxford Radar RobotCar, D-Behavior (D-Set), nuScenes by Motional, and Comma2k19. The goal is to streamline data processing workflows, reduce the complexity of deploying multiple models, and make intelligent transportation systems more efficient and accurate. The study was conducted using state-of-the-art hardware, leveraging the computational power of AMD RTX 3060 GPUs and Intel i9-12900 processors. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves an average accuracy of 91.33\% across these datasets, with the highest accuracy observed in time-series data (92.7\%), showcasing the model's proficiency in handling sequential information essential for tasks such as motion planning and predictive maintenance. Through our exploration, we demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of LLMs in handling multimodal data within the transportation sector, ultimately providing insights into their application in real-world scenarios. Our findings align with the broader conference themes, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in advancing transportation technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI) 2025</p></details> |
| **[EDformer: Embedded Decomposition Transformer for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12227v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a crucial challenge with significant applications in areas such as weather prediction, stock market analysis, and scientific simulations. This paper introduces an embedded decomposed transformer, 'EDformer', for multivariate time series forecasting tasks. Without altering the fundamental elements, we reuse the Transformer architecture and consider the capable functions of its constituent parts in this work. Edformer first decomposes the input multivariate signal into seasonal and trend components. Next, the prominent multivariate seasonal component is reconstructed across the reverse dimensions, followed by applying the attention mechanism and feed-forward network in the encoder stage. In particular, the feed-forward network is used for each variable frame to learn nonlinear representations, while the attention mechanism uses the time points of individual seasonal series embedded within variate frames to capture multivariate correlations. Therefore, the trend signal is added with projection and performs the final forecasting. The EDformer model obtains state-of-the-art predicting results in terms of accuracy and efficiency on complex real-world time series datasets. This paper also addresses model explainability techniques to provide insights into how the model makes its predictions and why specific features or time steps are important, enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of the forecasting results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Apollo-Forecast: Overcoming Aliasing and Inference Speed Challenges in Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12226v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Encoding time series into tokens and using language models for processing has been shown to substantially augment the models' ability to generalize to unseen tasks. However, existing language models for time series forecasting encounter several obstacles, including aliasing distortion and prolonged inference times, primarily due to the limitations of quantization processes and the computational demands of large models. This paper introduces Apollo-Forecast, a novel framework that tackles these challenges with two key innovations: the Anti-Aliasing Quantization Module (AAQM) and the Race Decoding (RD) technique. AAQM adeptly encodes sequences into tokens while mitigating high-frequency noise in the original signals, thus enhancing both signal fidelity and overall quantization efficiency. RD employs a draft model to enable parallel processing and results integration, which markedly accelerates the inference speed for long-term predictions, particularly in large-scale models. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show that Apollo-Forecast outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 35.41\% and 18.99\% in WQL and MASE metrics, respectively, in zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, our method achieves a 1.9X-2.7X acceleration in inference speed over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

With extensive Earth observation data, these tasks can be integrated and enhanced through multi-task deep learning models. We present a comprehensive multi-temporal remote sensing dataset for active fire detection, daily wildfire monitoring, and next-day wildfire prediction. Covering wildfire events in the contiguous U.S. from January 2017 to October 2021, the dataset includes 3552 surface reflectance images and auxiliary data such as weather, topography, land cover, and fuel information, totalling 71 GB. The lifecycle of each wildfire is documented, with labels for active fires (AF) and burned areas (BA), supported by manual quality assurance of AF and BA test labels. The dataset supports three tasks: a) active fire detection, b) daily burned area mapping, and c) wildfire progression prediction. Detection tasks use pixel-wise classification of multi-spectral, multi-temporal images, while prediction tasks integrate satellite and auxiliary data to model fire dynamics. This dataset and its benchmarks provide a foundation for advancing wildfire research using deep learning.</p></details> |  |

Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | accepted at AAAI'25 |
| **[Are Large Language Models Useful for Time Series Data Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12219v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data plays a critical role across diverse domains such as healthcare, energy, and finance, where tasks like classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting are essential for informed decision-making. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence for their ability to handle complex data and extract meaningful insights. This study investigates whether LLMs are effective for time series data analysis by comparing their performance with non-LLM-based approaches across three tasks: classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Through a series of experiments using GPT4TS and autoregressive models, we evaluate their performance on benchmark datasets and assess their accuracy, precision, and ability to generalize. Our findings indicate that while LLM-based methods excel in specific tasks like anomaly detection, their benefits are less pronounced in others, such as forecasting, where simpler models sometimes perform comparably or better. This research highlights the role of LLMs in time series analysis and lays the groundwork for future studies to systematically explore their applications and limitations in handling temporal data.</p></details> |  |

However, most traditional deep learning predictors rely solely on unimodal numerical data, using a fixed-length window for training and prediction on a single dataset, and cannot adapt to different scenarios. The powered pre-trained large language model has introduced new opportunities for time series analysis. Yet, existing methods are either inefficient in training, incapable of handling textual information, or lack zero-shot forecasting capability. In this paper, we innovatively model time series as a foreign language and construct ChatTime, a unified framework for time series and text processing. As an out-of-the-box multimodal time series foundation model, ChatTime provides zero-shot forecasting capability and supports bimodal input/output for both time series and text. We design a series of experiments to verify the superior performance of ChatTime across multiple tasks and scenarios, and create four multimodal datasets to address data gaps. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and utility of ChatTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Individual Bus Trip Chain Prediction and Pattern Identification Considering Similarities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11364v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future bus trip chains for an existing user is of great significance for operators of public transit systems. Existing methods always treat this task as a time-series prediction problem, but the 1-dimensional time series structure cannot express the complex relationship between trips. To better capture the inherent patterns in bus travel behavior, this paper proposes a novel approach that synthesizes future bus trip chains based on those from similar days. Key similarity patterns are defined and tested using real-world data, and a similarity function is then developed to capture these patterns. Afterwards, a graph is constructed where each day is represented as a node and edge weight reflects the similarity between days. Besides, the trips on a given day can be regarded as labels for each node, transferring the bus trip chain prediction problem to a semi-supervised classification problem on a graph. To address this, we propose several methods and validate them on a real-world dataset of 10000 bus users, achieving state-of-the-art prediction results. Analyzing the parameters of similarity function reveals some interesting bus usage patterns, allowing us can to cluster bus users into three types: repeat-dominated, evolve-dominate and repeat-evolve balanced. In summary, our work demonstrates the effectiveness of similarity-based prediction for bus trip chains and provides a new perspective for analyzing individual bus travel patterns. The code for our prediction model is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

While this issue is well-explored in image generation, it remains underinvestigated for time series data. We introduce a new definition of mode collapse specific to time series and propose a novel metric, DMD-GEN, to quantify its severity. Our metric utilizes Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven technique for identifying coherent spatiotemporal patterns, and employs Optimal Transport between DMD eigenvectors to assess discrepancies between the underlying dynamics of the original and generated data. This approach not only quantifies the preservation of essential dynamic characteristics but also provides interpretability by pinpointing which modes have collapsed. We validate DMD-GEN on both synthetic and real-world datasets using various generative models, including TimeGAN, TimeVAE, and DiffusionTS. The results demonstrate that DMD-GEN correlates well with traditional evaluation metrics for static data while offering the advantage of applicability to dynamic data. This work offers for the first time a definition of mode collapse for time series, improving understanding, and forming the basis of our tool for assessing and improving generative models in the time series domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer-Based Bearing Fault Detection using Temporal Decomposition Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11245v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bearing fault detection is a critical task in predictive maintenance, where accurate and timely fault identification can prevent costly downtime and equipment damage. Traditional attention mechanisms in Transformer neural networks often struggle to capture the complex temporal patterns in bearing vibration data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel attention mechanism, Temporal Decomposition Attention (TDA), which combines temporal bias encoding with seasonal-trend decomposition to capture both long-term dependencies and periodic fluctuations in time series data. Additionally, we incorporate the Hull Exponential Moving Average (HEMA) for feature extraction, enabling the model to effectively capture meaningful characteristics from the data while reducing noise. Our approach integrates TDA into the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to focus separately on the trend and seasonal components of the data. Experimental results on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault detection dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional attention mechanisms and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The HEMA-Transformer-TDA model achieves an accuracy of 98.1%, with exceptional precision, recall, and F1-scores, demonstrating its effectiveness in bearing fault detection and its potential for application in other time series tasks with seasonal patterns or trends.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a selective review of recent advancements in deep neural network-based approaches for SSMs, and presents a unified perspective for discrete time deep state space models and continuous time ones such as latent neural Ordinary Differential and Stochastic Differential Equations. It starts with an overview of the classical maximum likelihood based approach for learning SSMs, reviews variational autoencoder as a general learning pipeline for neural network-based approaches in the presence of latent variables, and discusses in detail representative deep learning models that fall under the SSM framework. Very recent developments, where SSMs are used as standalone architectural modules for improving efficiency in sequence modeling, are also examined. Finally, examples involving mixed frequency and irregularly-spaced time series data are presented to demonstrate the advantage of SSMs in these settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Risk Control via Prediction-Powered Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11174v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) framework is a general tool for transforming the output of any machine learning model to design a predictive rule with rigorous error rate control. The key idea behind this framework is to use labeled hold-out calibration data to tune a hyper-parameter that affects the error rate of the resulting prediction rule. However, the limitation of such a calibration scheme is that with limited hold-out data, the tuned hyper-parameter becomes noisy and leads to a prediction rule with an error rate that is often unnecessarily conservative. To overcome this sample-size barrier, we introduce a semi-supervised calibration procedure that leverages unlabeled data to rigorously tune the hyper-parameter without compromising statistical validity. Our procedure builds upon the prediction-powered inference framework, carefully tailoring it to risk-controlling tasks. We demonstrate the benefits and validity of our proposal through two real-data experiments: few-shot image classification and early time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Latent Spaces for Domain Generalization in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11171v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in many real-world applications, yet developing models that generalize well on unseen relevant domains -- such as forecasting web traffic data on new platforms/websites or estimating e-commerce demand in new regions -- remains underexplored. Existing forecasting models often struggle with domain shifts in time series data, as the temporal patterns involve complex components like trends, seasonality, etc. While some prior work addresses this by matching feature distributions across domains or disentangling domain-shared features using label information, they fail to reveal insights into the latent temporal dependencies, which are critical for identifying common patterns across domains and achieving generalization. We propose a framework for domain generalization in time series forecasting by mining the latent factors that govern temporal dependencies across domains. Our approach uses a decomposition-based architecture with a new Conditional $\beta$-Variational Autoencoder (VAE), wherein time series data is first decomposed into trend-cyclical and seasonal components, each modeled independently through separate $\beta$-VAE modules. The $\beta$-VAE aims to capture disentangled latent factors that control temporal dependencies across domains. We enhance the learning of domain-specific information with a decoder-conditional design and introduce domain regularization to improve the separation of domain-shared and domain-specific latent factors. Our proposed method is flexible and can be applied to various time series forecasting models, enabling effective domain generalization with simplicity and efficiency. We validate its effectiveness on five real-world time series datasets, covering web traffic, e-commerce, finance and power consumption, demonstrating improved generalization performance over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 8 figures</p></details> |

Imputation, i.e., filling in the missing values, is a common way to deal with this issue. In this study, we compare imputation methods, including Multiple Imputation with Random Forest (MICE-RF) and advanced deep learning approaches (SAITS, BRITS, Transformer) for noisy, missing time series data in terms of MAE, F1-score, AUC, and MCC, across missing data rates (10 % - 80 %). Our results show that MICE-RF can effectively impute missing data compared to deep learning methods and the improvement in classification of data imputed indicates that imputation can have denoising effects. Therefore, using an imputation algorithm on time series with missing data can, at the same time, offer denoising effects.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LZC-based metrics, such as Permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC) and Dispersion-Entropy based Lempel-Ziv complexity (DELZC), focus mainly on patterns of independent embedding vectors, often overlooking the transition patterns within the time series. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel LZC-based method called Bidirectional Transition Dispersion Entropy-based Lempel-Ziv complexity (BT-DELZC). Leveraging Markov chain theory, this method integrates a bidirectional transition network framework with DELZC to better capture dynamic signal information. Additionally, an improved hierarchical decomposition algorithm is used to extract features from various frequency components of the time series. The proposed BT-DELZC method is first evaluated through four simulated experiments, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in characterizing nonlinear time series. Additionally, two fault-bearing diagnosis experiments are conducted by combining the hierarchical BT-DELZC method with various classifiers from the machine learning domain. The results indicate that BT-DELZC achieves the highest accuracy across both datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods such as LZC, PLZC, and DELZC in extracting features related to fault bearings.</p></details> |  |

However, despite much real-world data being collected as time series, there is a lack of studies on transparent time series models. To address this gap, we propose a novel transparent neural network model for time series called Generalized Additive Time Series Model (GATSM). GATSM consists of two parts: 1) independent feature networks to learn feature representations, and 2) a transparent temporal module to learn temporal patterns across different time steps using the feature representations. This structure allows GATSM to effectively capture temporal patterns and handle dynamic-length time series while preserving transparency. Empirical experiments show that GATSM significantly outperforms existing generalized additive models and achieves comparable performance to black-box time series models, such as recurrent neural networks and Transformer. In addition, we demonstrate that GATSM finds interesting patterns in time series.

However, accurate forecasting is challenging due to two main factors. First, real-world time series often show heterogeneous temporal patterns caused by distribution shifts over time. Second, correlations among channels are complex and intertwined, making it hard to model the interactions among channels precisely and flexibly. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a general framework called \textbf{DUET}, which introduces \underline{DU}al clustering on the temporal and channel dimensions to \underline{E}nhance multivariate \underline{T}ime series forecasting. First, we design a Temporal Clustering Module (TCM) that clusters time series into fine-grained distributions to handle heterogeneous temporal patterns. For different distribution clusters, we design various pattern extractors to capture their intrinsic temporal patterns, thus modeling the heterogeneity. Second, we introduce a novel Channel-Soft-Clustering strategy and design a Channel Clustering Module (CCM), which captures the relationships among channels in the frequency domain through metric learning and applies sparsification to mitigate the adverse effects of noisy channels. Finally, DUET combines TCM and CCM to incorporate both the temporal and channel dimensions. Extensive experiments on 25 real-world datasets from 10 application domains, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DUET.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Uncovering Temporal Patterns in Visualizations of High-Dimensional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19040v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of high-dimensional data, analysts often rely on exploratory data analysis to understand complex data sets. A key approach to exploring such data is dimensionality reduction, which embeds high-dimensional data in two dimensions to enable visual exploration. However, popular embedding techniques, such as t-SNE and UMAP, typically assume that data points are independent. When this assumption is violated, as in time-series data, the resulting visualizations may fail to reveal important temporal patterns and trends. To address this, we propose a formal extension to existing dimensionality reduction methods that incorporates two temporal loss terms that explicitly highlight temporal progression in the embedded visualizations. Through a series of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively uncovers temporal patterns and improves the interpretability of the visualizations. Furthermore, the method improves temporal coherence while preserving the fidelity of the embeddings, providing a robust tool for dynamic data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Method for Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification is crucial for space safety and satellite monitoring, involving the analysis of typical satellite behaviors such as station-keeping, drift, etc. However, existing PoL identification methods remain underdeveloped due to the complexity of aerospace systems, variability in satellite behaviors, and fluctuating observation sampling rates. In a first attempt, we developed a domain expertise-informed machine learning method (Expert-ML) to combine satellite orbital movement knowledge and machine learning models. The Expert-ML method achieved high accuracy results in simulation data and real-world data with normal sampling rate. However, this approach lacks of generality as it requires domain expertise and its performance degraded significantly when data sampling rate varied. To achieve generality, we propose a novel diffusion-based PoL identification method. Distinct from prior approaches, the proposed method leverages a diffusion model to achieve end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, we employ a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data. The encoded features are subsequently incorporated as conditional information in the denoising process to generate PoL labels. Through experimentation across real-world satellite settings, our proposed diffusion-based method demonstrates its high identification quality and provides a robust solution even with reduced data sampling rates, indicating its great potential in practical satellite behavior pattern identification, tracking and related mission deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConvTimeNet: A Deep Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Model for Multivariate Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01493v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing effective models for learning time series representations is foundational for time series analysis. Many previous works have explored time series representation modeling approaches and have made progress in this area. Despite their effectiveness, they lack adaptive perception of local patterns in temporally dependent basic units and fail to capture the multi-scale dependency among these units. Instead of relying on prevalent methods centered around self-attention mechanisms, we propose ConvTimeNet, a hierarchical pure convolutional model designed for time series analysis. ConvTimeNet introduces a deformable patch layer that adaptively perceives local patterns of temporally dependent basic units in a data-driven manner. Based on the extracted local patterns, hierarchical pure convolutional blocks are designed to capture dependency relationships among the representations of basic units at different scales. Moreover, a large kernel mechanism is employed to ensure that convolutional blocks can be deeply stacked, thereby achieving a larger receptive field. In this way, local patterns and their multi-scale dependencies can be effectively modeled within a single model. Extensive experiments comparing a wide range of different types of models demonstrate that pure convolutional models still exhibit strong viability, effectively addressing the aforementioned two challenges and showing superior performance across multiple tasks. The code is available for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistep Brent Oil Price Forecasting with a Multi-Aspect Meta-heuristic Optimization and Ensemble Deep Learning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12062v2)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crude oil price forecasting is crucial for various economic activities, including energy trading, risk management, and investment planning. Although deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for crude oil price forecasting, achieving accurate forecasts remains challenging. Deep learning models' performance is heavily influenced by hyperparameters tuning, and they are expected to perform differently under various circumstances. Furthermore, price volatility is also sensitive to external factors such as world events. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates metaheuristic optimization with an ensemble of five widely used neural network architectures for time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that apply metaheuristics to optimise hyperparameters within the neural network architecture, we exploit the GWO metaheuristic optimiser at four levels: feature selection, data preparation, model training, and forecast blending. The proposed approach has been evaluated for forecasting three-ahead days using real-world Brent crude oil price data, and the obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the forecasting performance measured using various benchmarks, achieving 0.000127 of MSE.</p></details> |  |

We measure a set of spatially sparse velocity time-series data downstream of differently-shaped orifices. We then train random forest multiclass classifier models on a vector of invariants derived from this time-series. We test the above hypothesis with 25 somewhat similar orifice shapes to push the model to its extreme limits. Remarkably, the algorithm was able to identify the orifice shape with 100% accuracy and 100% precision. This outcome is enabled by the uniqueness in the downstream temporal evolution of turbulence structures in the flow past orifices, combined with the random forests' ability to learn subtle yet discerning features in the turbulence microstructure. We are also able to explain the underlying flow physics that enables such classification by listing the invariant measures in the order of increasing information entropy. We show that the temporal autocorrelation coefficients of the time-series are most sensitive to orifice shape and are therefore informative. The ability to identify changes in system geometry without the need for physical disassembly offers tremendous potential for flow control and system identification. Furthermore, the proposed approach could potentially have significant applications in other unrelated fields as well, by deploying the core methodology of training random forest classifiers on vectors of invariant measures obtained from time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 10 pages, 4 figures; SI Appendix: 24 pages, 3 figures; Submitted to PNAS</p></details> |
| **[WaveGNN: Modeling Irregular Multivariate Time Series for Accurate Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10621v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling and analyzing time series data is crucial for downstream applications across various fields, including healthcare, finance, astronomy, and epidemiology. However, real-world time series often exhibit irregularities such as misaligned timestamps, missing entries, and variable sampling rates, complicating their analysis. Existing approaches often rely on imputation, which can introduce biases. A few approaches that directly model irregularity tend to focus exclusively on either capturing intra-series patterns or inter-series relationships, missing the benefits of integrating both. To this end, we present WaveGNN, a novel framework designed to directly (i.e., no imputation) embed irregularly sampled multivariate time series data for accurate predictions. WaveGNN utilizes a Transformer-based encoder to capture intra-series patterns by directly encoding the temporal dynamics of each time series. To capture inter-series relationships, WaveGNN uses a dynamic graph neural network model, where each node represents a sensor, and the edges capture the long- and short-term relationships between them. Our experimental results on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that WaveGNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, with an average relative improvement of 14.7% in F1-score when compared to the second-best baseline in cases with extreme sparsity. Our ablation studies reveal that both intra-series and inter-series modeling significantly contribute to this notable improvement.</p></details> |  |

We extend the self-attention mechanism and the transformer architecture to a higher order, effectively capturing complex market dynamics across time and variables. To manage computational complexity, we propose a low-rank approximation of the potentially large attention tensor using tensor decomposition and employ kernel attention, reducing complexity to linear with respect to the data size. Additionally, we present an encoder-decoder model that integrates technical and fundamental analysis, utilizing multimodal signals from historical prices and related tweets. Our experiments on the Stocknet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential for enhancing stock movement prediction in financial markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2024 Workshop on Machine Learning in Finance</p></details> |

At the same time, the scale and types of data available are problematic for traditional open-source intelligence. This paper focuses on identifying specific weapon systems and the insignias of the armed groups using them as documented in the Ukraine war, as these tasks are critical to operational intelligence and tracking weapon proliferation, especially given the scale of international military aid given to Ukraine. The large scale of social media makes manual assessment difficult, however, so this paper presents early work that uses computer vision models to support this task. We demonstrate that these models can both identify weapons embedded in images shared in social media and how the resulting collection of military-relevant images and their post times interact with the offline, real-world conflict. Not only can we then track changes in the prevalence of images of tanks, land mines, military trucks, etc., we find correlations among time series data associated with these images and the daily fatalities in this conflict. This work shows substantial opportunity for examining similar online documentation of conflict contexts, and we also point to future avenues where computer vision can be further improved for these open-source intelligence tasks.</p></details> |  |

The robust feature extraction capability of CNN is utilized to preprocess and analyze extensive network text data, identifying local features and patterns. The extracted feature sequences are then input into the GRU model to understand the progression of emotional states over time and their potential impact on future market sentiment and risk. This approach addresses the order dependence and long-term dependencies inherent in time series data, resulting in a detailed analysis of stock market sentiment and effective early warnings of future risks.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, many data-driven machine learning and statistical models rely on the wealth of longitudinal EHRs to study patients' physiological and treatment effects. However, longitudinal EHRs tend to be sparse and highly missing, where missingness could also be informative and reflect the underlying patient's health status. Therefore, the success of data-driven models for personalized medicine highly depends on how the EHR data is represented from physiological data, treatments, and the missing values in the data. To this end, we propose a novel deep-learning model that learns the underlying patient dynamics over time across multivariate data to generate personalized realistic values conditioning on an individual's demographic characteristics and treatments. Our proposed model, IGNITE (Individualized GeNeration of Imputations in Time-series Electronic health records), utilises a conditional dual-variational autoencoder augmented with dual-stage attention to generate missing values for an individual. In IGNITE, we further propose a novel individualized missingness mask (IMM), which helps our model generate values based on the individual's observed data and missingness patterns. We further extend the use of IGNITE from imputing missingness to a personalized data synthesizer, where it generates missing EHRs that were never observed prior or even generates new patients for various applications. We validate our model on three large publicly available datasets and show that IGNITE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in missing data reconstruction and task prediction.</p></details> |  |

Our asset selection strategy exploits the topological features of stock price movements to select a subset of topologically similar (different) assets for a sparse index tracking (Markowitz) portfolio. We introduce new distance measures, which serve as an input to the clustering algorithm, on the space of persistence diagrams and landscapes that consider the time component of a time series. We conduct an empirical analysis on the S\&P index from 2009 to 2022, including a study on the COVID-19 data to validate the robustness of our methodology. Our strategy to integrate TDA with the clustering algorithm significantly enhanced the performance of sparse portfolios across various performance measures in diverse market scenarios.</p></details> |  |

It highlights the need to identify essential properties of these activations to improve their effectiveness in specific domains. To this end, the study comprehensively analyzes properties, such as bounded, monotonic, nonlinearity, and periodicity, for activation in time series neural networks. We propose a new activation that maximizes the coverage of these properties, called LeakySineLU. We empirically evaluate the LeakySineLU against commonly used activations in the literature using 112 benchmark datasets for time series classification, obtaining the best average ranking in all comparative scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This leads us to ask the question: treating market prices as a time series, can large models be used to predict the market? In this paper, we answer this by evaluating the performance of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price prediction. We find that due to the irregular nature of price data, directly applying TimesFM gives unsatisfactory results and propose to fine-tune TimeFM on financial data for the task of price prediction. This is done by continual pre-training of the latest time series foundation model TimesFM on price data containing 100 million time points, spanning a range of financial instruments spanning hourly and daily granularities. The fine-tuned model demonstrates higher price prediction accuracy than the baseline model. We conduct mock trading for our model in various financial markets and show that it outperforms various benchmarks in terms of returns, sharpe ratio, max drawdown and trading cost.</p></details> |  |

Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper, we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters with events of interest in the detector.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to The 5th International Workshop on Big Data & AI Tools, Methods, and Use Cases for Innovative Scientific Discovery (BTSD 2024)</p></details> |

For non-stationary time series, the data distribution in the current online interval may have appeared in previous offline intervals. We theoretically explore the feasibility of applying knowledge from offline intervals to the current online interval. To this end, we propose the Mixture of Online and Offline Experts (MOOE). MOOE learns static offline experts from offline intervals and maintains a dynamic online expert for the current online interval. It then adaptively combines the offline and online experts using a meta expert to make predictions for the samples received in the online interval. Specifically, we focus on theoretical analysis, deriving parameter convergence, regret bounds, and generalization error bounds to prove the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[WormKAN: Are KAN Effective for Identifying and Tracking Concept Drift in Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10041v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. However, existing models often struggle to detect and track concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. To address this challenge, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose WormKAN, a concept-aware KAN-based model to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN consists of three key components: Patch Normalization, Temporal Representation Module, and Concept Dynamics. Patch normalization processes co-evolving time series into patches, treating them as fundamental modeling units to capture local dependencies while ensuring consistent scaling. The temporal representation module learns robust latent representations by leveraging a KAN-based autoencoder, complemented by a smoothness constraint, to uncover inter-patch correlations. Concept dynamics identifies and tracks dynamic transitions, revealing structural shifts in the time series through concept identification and drift detection. These transitions, akin to passing through a \textit{wormhole}, are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drift.</p></details> |  |

Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |

Using aerial and ground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing the ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision agriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping) and detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints across multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we image same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are repeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season. Aerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo values. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed view of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature detection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor of berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant biologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\ comparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we create a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality reduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening paths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of four cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the first of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops including wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize. Aerial and ground datasets are made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.00028</p></details> |

In the early stages of the breeding pipeline, soybean breeding programs assign relative maturity ratings to experimental varieties that indicate their suitable maturity zones. Traditionally, the estimation of maturity value for breeding varieties has involved breeders manually inspecting fields and assessing maturity value visually. This approach relies heavily on rater judgment, making it subjective and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model for evaluating soybean maturity using UAV-based time-series imagery. Images were captured at three-day intervals, beginning as the earliest varieties started maturing and continuing until the last varieties fully matured. The data collected for this experiment consisted of 22,043 plots collected across three years (2021 to 2023) and represent relative maturity groups 1.6 - 3.9. We utilized contour plot images extracted from the time-series UAV RGB imagery as input for a neural network model. This contour plot approach encoded the temporal and spatial variation within each plot into a single image. A deep learning model was trained to utilize this contour plot to predict maturity ratings. This model significantly improves accuracy and robustness, achieving up to 85% accuracy. We also evaluate the model's accuracy as we reduce the number of time points, quantifying the trade-off between temporal resolution and maturity prediction. The predictive model offers a scalable, objective, and efficient means of assessing crop maturity, enabling phenomics and ML approaches to reduce the reliance on manual inspection and subjective assessment. This approach enables the automatic prediction of relative maturity ratings in a breeding program, saving time and resources.</p></details> |  |

The cable industry proposed a framework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable networks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how to use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools in the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper, we propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine learning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband networks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately detecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a network or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to generate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as hints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features. Further, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices sharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that occur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise, as these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to repair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from an ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance. Our evaluation results show that CableMon can effectively detect and distinguish failures from PNM data and outperforms existing public-domain tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages including reference.

At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for research idea generation often overlooks these theoretical foundations. We present a framework that explicitly implements combinatorial creativity theory using LLMs, featuring a generalization-level retrieval system for cross-domain knowledge discovery and a structured combinatorial process for idea generation. The retrieval system maps concepts across different abstraction levels to enable meaningful connections between disparate domains, while the combinatorial process systematically analyzes and recombines components to generate novel solutions. Experiments on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, consistently outperforming baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments (improving similarity scores by 7\%-10\% across multiple metrics). Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can effectively realize combinatorial creativity when guided by appropriate theoretical frameworks, contributing both to practical advancement of AI-assisted research and theoretical understanding of machine creativity.</p></details> |  |

While LLM judges have shown promise on constrained evaluation tasks, closed source LLMs display critical shortcomings when deployed in real world applications due to challenges of fine grained metrics and explainability, while task specific evaluation models lack cross-domain generalization. We introduce GLIDER, a powerful 3B evaluator LLM that can score any text input and associated context on arbitrary user defined criteria. GLIDER shows higher Pearson's correlation than GPT-4o on FLASK and greatly outperforms prior evaluation models, achieving comparable performance to LLMs 17x its size. GLIDER supports fine-grained scoring, multilingual reasoning, span highlighting and was trained on 685 domains and 183 criteria. Extensive qualitative analysis shows that GLIDER scores are highly correlated with human judgments, with 91.3% human agreement. We have open-sourced GLIDER to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

This paper critically examines whether recent LLM-based test generation tools, such as Codium CoverAgent and CoverUp, can effectively find bugs or unintentionally validate faulty code. Considering bugs are only exposed by failing test cases, we explore the question: can these tools truly achieve the intended objectives of software testing when their test oracles are designed to pass? Using real human-written buggy code as input, we evaluate these tools, showing how LLM-generated tests can fail to detect bugs and, more alarmingly, how their design can worsen the situation by validating bugs in the generated test suite and rejecting bug-revealing tests. These findings raise important questions about the validity of the design behind LLM-based test generation tools and their impact on software quality and test suite reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/MagicPIG.</p></details> |  |

However, generating ST code with LLMs poses unique challenges due to limited data in public training datasets and the complexity of ST language syntax. This paper proposes an approach to fine-tune LLMs for the generation of ST code that leverages a preference-based learning method through an online process involving compiler feedback and evaluation from an LLM-based ST expert. In this framework, the model is iteratively refined and generates new training samples, which are subsequently evaluated by a compiler for syntactical correctness and by a specialized LLM that excels at assessing semantic accuracy, though it is not optimized for code generation itself. This approach results in marked improvements for the trained LLM, leading to higher compilation success rates and better semantic precision. As a result, the framework proves highly suitable for industrial automation applications and outperforms state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Code Workshop @ ICSE 2025.

Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, KaLLM workshop</p></details> |

Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. Our results show that finetuning on curated non-harmful text is more effective for mitigating bias, and finetuning on direct preference optimization (DPO) datasets is more effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Steerable Alignment: Adapting Rewards and LLM Policies with Neural Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13998v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in everyday applications, ensuring their alignment with the diverse preferences of individual users has become a critical challenge. Currently deployed approaches typically assume homogeneous user objectives and rely on single-objective fine-tuning. However, human preferences are inherently heterogeneous, influenced by various unobservable factors, leading to conflicting signals in preference data. Existing solutions addressing this diversity often require costly datasets labelled for specific objectives and involve training multiple reward models or LLM policies, which is computationally expensive and impractical. In this work, we present a novel framework for few-shot steerable alignment, where users' underlying preferences are inferred from a small sample of their choices. To achieve this, we extend the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to handle heterogeneous preferences with unobserved variability factors and propose its practical implementation for reward modelling and LLM fine-tuning. Thanks to our proposed approach of functional parameter-space conditioning, LLMs trained with our framework can be adapted to individual preferences at inference time, generating outputs over a continuum of behavioural modes. We empirically validate the effectiveness of methods, demonstrating their ability to capture and align with diverse human preferences in a data-efficient manner. Our code is made available at: https://github.com/kasia-kobalczyk/few-shot-steerable-alignment.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Probability Distribution Sampling in Large Language Models for Behavioral Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09043v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) for handling complex language tasks, an increasing number of studies are employing LLMs as agents to emulate the sequential decision-making processes of humans often represented as Markov decision-making processes (MDPs). The actions in MDPs adhere to specific probability distributions and require iterative sampling. This arouses curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability distributions, thereby guiding the agent's behavioral decision-making through probabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above question, we divide the problem into two main aspects: sequence simulation with known probability distribution and sequence simulation with unknown probability distribution. Our analysis indicates that LLM agents can understand probabilities, but they struggle with probability sampling. Their ability to perform probabilistic sampling can be improved to some extent by integrating coding tools, but this level of sampling precision still makes it difficult to simulate human behavior as agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 3...</summary><p>The 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025)</p></details> |

Recent research has shown that explanations provide valuable information for understanding human label variation (HLV) and large language models (LLMs) can approximate HJD from a few human-provided label-explanation pairs. However, collecting explanations for every label is still time-consuming. This paper examines whether LLMs can be used to replace humans in generating explanations for approximating HJD. Specifically, we use LLMs as annotators to generate model explanations for a few given human labels. We test ways to obtain and combine these label-explanations with the goal to approximate human judgment distribution. We further compare the resulting human with model-generated explanations, and test automatic and human explanation selection. Our experiments show that LLM explanations are promising for NLI: to estimate HJD, generated explanations yield comparable results to human's when provided with human labels. Importantly, our results generalize from datasets with human explanations to i) datasets where they are not available and ii) challenging out-of-distribution test sets.</p></details> | 25 pages, 21 figures |

This work presents a detailed analysis of strategies for developing a model capable of following instructions in a low-resource language, specifically Basque, by focusing on three key stages: pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Our findings demonstrate that continual pre-training with a high-quality Basque corpus of around 600 million words improves natural language understanding (NLU) of the foundational model by over 12 points. Moreover, instruction tuning and human preference alignment using automatically translated datasets proved highly effective, resulting in a 24-point improvement in instruction-following performance. The resulting models, Llama-eus-8B and Llama-eus-8B-instruct, establish a new state-of-the-art for Basque in the sub-10B parameter category.</p></details> |  |

Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, ``the best of two worlds'', from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at Paclic 38, 2024</p></details> |

These persona agents offer significant enhancements across diverse sectors, such as education, healthcare, and entertainment, where model developers can align agent responses to different user requirements thereby broadening the scope of agent applications. However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents. Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5 despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention towards faithful and performant persona agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

LLMs continue to be vulnerable to external threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, prior works tend to focus on performing white-box attacks, overlooking black-box settings. In this work, we propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack Tree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under black-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced stealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal that implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher attack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service response latency by over 250 $\times \uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage.

However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench -- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

| **[Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13147v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in LLMs' "realistic" reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Conventional SR models often focus solely on capturing sequential patterns within the training data, neglecting the broader context and semantic information embedded in item titles from external sources. This limits their predictive power and adaptability. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in SR tasks due to their advanced understanding capabilities and strong generalization abilities. Researchers have attempted to enhance LLMs-based recommendation performance by incorporating information from conventional SR models. However, previous approaches have encountered problems such as 1) limited textual information leading to poor recommendation performance, 2) incomplete understanding and utilization of conventional SR model information by LLMs, and 3) excessive complexity and low interpretability of LLMs-based methods. To improve the performance of LLMs-based SR, we propose a novel framework, Distilling Sequential Pattern to Enhance LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation (DELRec), which aims to extract knowledge from conventional SR models and enable LLMs to easily comprehend and utilize the extracted knowledge for more effective SRs. DELRec consists of two main stages: 1) Distill Pattern from Conventional SR Models, focusing on extracting behavioral patterns exhibited by conventional SR models using soft prompts through two well-designed strategies; 2) LLMs-based Sequential Recommendation, aiming to fine-tune LLMs to effectively use the distilled auxiliary information to perform SR tasks. Extensive experimental results conducted on four real datasets validate the effectiveness of the DELRec framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, limited expertise and resource constraints often result in inefficiencies during the ramp-up phase when new products are integrated into production lines. Existing methods often lack structured and tailored solutions to support automation engineers in reducing ramp-up time, leading to compromises in quality. This research investigates whether large-language models (LLMs), combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can assist in streamlining equipment selection in ramp-up planning. We propose a factual-driven copilot integrating LLMs with structured and semi-structured knowledge retrieval for three component types (robots, feeders and vision systems), providing a guided and traceable state-machine process for decision-making in automation equipment selection. The system was demonstrated to an industrial partner, who tested it on three internal use-cases.

Traditional approaches, such as surveys and questionnaires, also face issues like small sample sizes and scalability. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SEM (Language Model-Based Student Engagement Metric), a novel approach that leverages video metadata and sentiment analysis of student comments to measure engagement. By utilizing recent Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate high-quality sentiment predictions to mitigate text fuzziness and normalize key features such as views and likes. Our holistic method combines comprehensive metadata with sentiment polarity scores to gauge engagement at both the course and lesson levels. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate various LLM models, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-SEM in providing a scalable and accurate measure of student engagement. We fine-tuned LLMs, including AraBERT, TXLM-RoBERTa, LLama 3B and Gemma 9B from Ollama, using human-annotated sentiment datasets to enhance prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cumulative Changes and Attractors in Iterated Cultural Transmissions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04503v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jeremyperez2/TelephoneGameLLM.

However, these models remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in which slight input perturbations can lead to harmful or misleading outputs. A gradient-based defensive suffix generation algorithm is designed to bolster the robustness of LLMs. By appending carefully optimized defensive suffixes to input prompts, the algorithm mitigates adversarial influences while preserving the models' utility. To enhance adversarial understanding, a novel total loss function ($L_{\text{total}}$) combining defensive loss ($L_{\text{def}}$) and adversarial loss ($L_{\text{adv}}$) generates defensive suffixes more effectively. Experimental evaluations conducted on open-source LLMs such as Gemma-7B, mistral-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B show that the proposed method reduces attack success rates (ASR) by an average of 11\% compared to models without defensive suffixes. Additionally, the perplexity score of Gemma-7B decreased from 6.57 to 3.93 when applying the defensive suffix generated by openELM-270M. Furthermore, TruthfulQA evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements with Truthfulness scores increasing by up to 10\% across tested configurations. This approach significantly enhances the security of LLMs in critical applications without requiring extensive retraining.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Traditional statistical causal discovery methods, while well-established, predominantly rely on observational data and often overlook the semantic cues inherent in cause-and-effect relationships. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an affordable way of leveraging the semantic cues for knowledge-driven causal discovery, but the development of LLMs for causal discovery lags behind other areas, particularly in the exploration of multi-modality data. To bridge the gap, we introduce MATMCD, a multi-agent system powered by tool-augmented LLMs. MATMCD has two key agents: a Data Augmentation agent that retrieves and processes modality-augmented data, and a Causal Constraint agent that integrates multi-modal data for knowledge-driven inference. Delicate design of the inner-workings ensures successful cooperation of the agents. Our empirical study across seven datasets suggests the significant potential of multi-modality enhanced causal discovery.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluation of vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.</p></details> |  |

However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the time-consuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor's digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more cost-effective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor's unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and therapy techniques. Subsequently, using existing single-turn long-text dialogues with client's questions, GPT-4 is guided to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific counselor. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, PsyDTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Experimental results indicate that our proposed PsyDT framework can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble real-world counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby show that our framework can effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced promising tools to automate these processes. However, their actual capabilities in writing comprehensive literature reviews remain underexplored, such as whether they can generate accurate and reliable references. To address this gap, we propose a framework to assess the literature review writing ability of LLMs automatically. We evaluate the performance of LLMs across three tasks: generating references, writing abstracts, and writing literature reviews. We employ external tools for a multidimensional evaluation, which includes assessing hallucination rates in references, semantic coverage, and factual consistency with human-written context. By analyzing the experimental results, we find that, despite advancements, even the most sophisticated models still cannot avoid generating hallucinated references.

However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts.

However, existing benchmarks are predominantly static, failing to capture the evolving nature of LLMs and knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and vulnerabilities such as contamination. In this paper, we introduce EvoWiki, an evolving dataset designed to reflect knowledge evolution by categorizing information into stable, evolved, and uncharted states. EvoWiki is fully auto-updatable, enabling precise evaluation of continuously changing knowledge and newly released LLMs. Through experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Contunual Learning (CL), we evaluate how effectively LLMs adapt to evolving knowledge. Our results indicate that current models often struggle with evolved knowledge, frequently providing outdated or incorrect responses. Moreover, the dataset highlights a synergistic effect between RAG and CL, demonstrating their potential to better adapt to evolving knowledge. EvoWiki provides a robust benchmark for advancing future research on the knowledge evolution capabilities of large language models.</p></details> |  |

Many existing datasets lack adequate representation of different groups, resulting in unreliable assessments. To tackle this, we propose a socio-culturally aware evaluation framework for LLM-driven content moderation and introduce a scalable method for creating diverse datasets using persona-based generation. Our analysis reveals that these datasets provide broader perspectives and pose greater challenges for LLMs than diversity-focused generation methods without personas. This challenge is especially pronounced in smaller LLMs, emphasizing the difficulties they encounter in moderating such diverse content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SUMEval Workshop in COLING 2025</p></details> |

Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks. However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks. In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms. Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs. We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data to Defense: The Role of Curation in Customizing LLMs Against Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02220v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely adapted for downstream applications through fine-tuning, a process named customization. However, recent studies have identified a vulnerability during this process, where malicious samples can compromise the robustness of LLMs and amplify harmful behaviors-an attack commonly referred to as jailbreaking. To address this challenge, we propose an adaptive data curation approach allowing any text to be curated to enhance its effectiveness in counteracting harmful samples during customization. To avoid the need for additional defensive modules, we further introduce a comprehensive mitigation framework spanning the lifecycle of the customization process: before customization to immunize LLMs against future jailbreak attempts, during customization to neutralize risks, and after customization to restore compromised models. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in jailbreaking effects, achieving up to a 100% success rate in generating safe responses. By combining adaptive data curation with lifecycle-based mitigation strategies, this work represents a solid step forward in mitigating jailbreaking risks and ensuring the secure adaptation of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

These prompts often contain business logic and sensitive information, making their protection essential. However, adversarial and even regular user queries can exploit LLM vulnerabilities to expose these hidden prompts. To address this issue, we present PromptKeeper, a novel defense mechanism for system prompt privacy. By reliably detecting worst-case leakage and regenerating outputs without the system prompt when necessary, PromptKeeper ensures robust protection against prompt extraction attacks via either adversarial or regular queries, while preserving conversational capability and runtime efficiency during benign user interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) technology give rise to social media bots with unprecedented intelligence. These bots adeptly simulate human profiles, conversations, and interactions, disseminating large amounts of false information and posing significant challenges to platform regulation. To better understand and counter these threats, we innovatively design BotSim, a malicious social botnet simulation powered by LLM. BotSim mimics the information dissemination patterns of real-world social networks, creating a virtual environment composed of intelligent agent bots and real human users. In the temporal simulation constructed by BotSim, these advanced agent bots autonomously engage in social interactions such as posting and commenting, effectively modeling scenarios of information flow and user interaction. Building on the BotSim framework, we construct a highly human-like, LLM-driven bot dataset called BotSim-24 and benchmark multiple bot detection strategies against it. The experimental results indicate that detection methods effective on traditional bot datasets perform worse on BotSim-24, highlighting the urgent need for new detection strategies to address the cybersecurity threats posed by these advanced bots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does VLM Classification Benefit from LLM Description Semantics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11917v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately describing images with text is a foundation of explainable AI. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have recently addressed this by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, expressing semantic similarities between vision and language embeddings. VLM classification can be improved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics, as the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling effect, where multiple modified text prompts act as a noisy test-time augmentation for the original one. We propose an alternative evaluation scenario to decide if a performance boost of LLM-generated descriptions is caused by such a noise augmentation effect or rather by genuine description semantics. The proposed scenario avoids noisy test-time augmentation and ensures that genuine, distinctive descriptions cause the performance boost. Furthermore, we propose a training-free method for selecting discriminative descriptions that work independently of classname-ensembling effects. Our approach identifies descriptions that effectively differentiate classes within a local CLIP label neighborhood, improving classification accuracy across seven datasets. Additionally, we provide insights into the explainability of description-based image classification with VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25, Code: https://github.com/CompVis/DisCLIP</p></details> |

However, they are mainly trained on English data and often struggle with low-resource languages. In this study, we explore adding a new language, i.e., Persian, to Llama (a model with a limited understanding of Persian) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We employ a multi-stage approach involving pretraining on monolingual Persian data, aligning representations through bilingual pretraining and instruction datasets, and instruction-tuning with task-specific datasets. We evaluate the model's performance at each stage on generation and classification tasks. Our findings suggest that incorporating the Persian language, through bilingual data alignment, can enhance classification accuracy for Persian tasks, with no adverse impact and sometimes even improvements on English tasks. Additionally, the results highlight the model's initial strength as a critical factor when working with limited training data, with cross-lingual alignment offering minimal benefits for the low-resource language. Knowledge transfer from English to Persian has a marginal effect, primarily benefiting simple classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at COLING 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on supervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning diverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B parameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various training configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained models. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing findings that challenge several common training practices, including hyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by Orca. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with lower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as MMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics, such as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of better final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs and significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of hyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide guidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not compromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in performance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked training is simpler and more sample efficient. With these findings holding robustly across datasets and models, we hope this study serves as a guide for practitioners fine-tuning small LLMs and promotes a more inclusive environment for LLM research.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 19 figures.

We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes $\approx$45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts.

In response, services that optimize or suggest prompts have emerged. While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to 78%) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.</p></details> |  |

Can we harness the power of large language models (LLMs) to assist researchers with these challenges? To investigate this question, we developed Papers-to-Posts, an LLM-powered tool that implements a new Plan-Draft-Revise workflow for mixed-initiative long-form paper summarization. An LLM-generated paper outline with pre-selected yet adjustable bullet points helps users to plan what information to include. Meanwhile, customizable LLM instructions support drafting the text with a suitable structure and revising the text to have an appropriate tone. Through two studies, we compared Papers-to-Posts to a strong baseline tool that provides an LLM-generated draft and access to free-form LLM prompting, and we found that Papers-to-Posts improved researchers' editing power. In a within-subjects lab study (N=20 participants), Papers-to-Posts led participants to make significantly more change to initial LLM drafts within a fixed amount of time and to be significantly more satisfied with their final blog post, without increasing cognitive load. Furthermore, in a between-subjects deployment study (N=37 blog posts, 26 participants), Papers-to-Posts led participants to make more change to initial LLM drafts within a given amount of time as well as writing actions, without decreasing satisfaction with the final blog posts or increasing cognitive load.</p></details> |  |

However, they maintain additional moving average states throughout training, which results in memory requirements several times greater than the model. This overhead imposes constraints on scalability and computational efficiency. On the other hand, while stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is optimal in terms of memory efficiency, their capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al., 2024b). To address this dilemma, we show that pre-processing SGD is sufficient to reach Adam-level performance on LLMs. Specifically, we propose to preprocess the instantaneous stochastic gradients with two simple operators: $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$. $\mathtt{GradNorm}$ stabilizes gradient distributions, and $\mathtt{GradWhitening}$ counteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape, respectively. This results in SWAN (SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates the need to store any accumulative state variables. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory footprint as SGD, achieving $\approx 50\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory compared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates the same or even a substantial improvement over Adam. Specifically, when pre-training the LLaMa model with 350M and 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation perplexity in less than half tokens seen.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we make a systematic review of the most up-to-date state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4) explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further improvements.

| **[Systematic Biases in LLM Simulations of Debates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04049v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), has opened exciting possibilities for constructing computational simulations designed to replicate human behavior accurately. Current research suggests that LLM-based agents become increasingly human-like in their performance, sparking interest in using these AI agents as substitutes for human participants in behavioral studies. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. Hence, it is crucial to study and pinpoint the key behavioral distinctions between humans and LLM-based agents. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates on topics that are important aspects of people's day-to-day lives and decision-making processes. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

However, it also intensifies concerns regarding the protection of copyright/confidential information. With the extensive adoption of private LLMs, safeguarding model copyright and ensuring data privacy have become critical. Text watermarking has emerged as a viable solution for detecting AI-generated content and protecting models. However, existing methods fall short in providing individualized watermarks for each user, a critical feature for enhancing accountability and traceability. In this paper, we introduce PersonaMark, a novel personalized text watermarking scheme designed to protect LLMs' copyrights and bolster accountability. PersonaMark leverages sentence structure as a subtle carrier of watermark information and optimizes the generation process to maintain the natural output of the model. By employing a personalized hashing function, unique watermarks are embedded for each user, enabling high-quality text generation without compromising the model's performance. This approach is both time-efficient and scalable, capable of handling large numbers of users through a multi-user hashing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer study to explore personalized watermarking in LLMs. We conduct extensive evaluations across four LLMs, analyzing various metrics such as perplexity, sentiment, alignment, and readability. The results validate that PersonaMark preserves text quality, ensures unbiased watermark insertion, and offers robust watermark detection capabilities, all while maintaining the model's behavior with minimal disruption.</p></details> | Under review |

To avoid reliability concerns with prior approaches, we propose to eliminate prompt engineering when probing LLMs for factual knowledge. Our approach, called Zero-Prompt Latent Knowledge Estimator (ZP-LKE), leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs to communicate both the factual knowledge question as well as the expected answer format. Our knowledge estimator is both conceptually simpler (i.e., doesn't depend on meta-linguistic judgments of LLMs) and easier to apply (i.e., is not LLM-specific), and we demonstrate that it can surface more of the latent knowledge embedded in LLMs. We also investigate how different design choices affect the performance of ZP-LKE. Using the proposed estimator, we perform a large-scale evaluation of the factual knowledge of a variety of open-source LLMs, like OPT, Pythia, Llama(2), Mistral, Gemma, etc. over a large set of relations and facts from the Wikidata knowledge base. We observe differences in the factual knowledge between different model families and models of different sizes, that some relations are consistently better known than others but that models differ in the precise facts they know, and differences in the knowledge of base models and their finetuned counterparts.

These challenges are exacerbated in complex, sensitive, and low-resource domains. Therefore, in this work we introduce IC-AnnoMI, an expert-annotated motivational interviewing (MI) dataset built upon AnnoMI by generating in-context conversational dialogues leveraging LLMs, particularly ChatGPT. IC-AnnoMI employs targeted prompts accurately engineered through cues and tailored information, taking into account therapy style (empathy, reflection), contextual relevance, and false semantic change. Subsequently, the dialogues are annotated by experts, strictly adhering to the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC), focusing on both the psychological and linguistic dimensions of MI dialogues. We comprehensively evaluate the IC-AnnoMI dataset and ChatGPT's emotional reasoning ability and understanding of domain intricacies by modeling novel classification tasks employing several classical machine learning and current state-of-the-art transformer approaches.

When faced with limited computational resources or small datasets, updating all model parameters can often result in overfitting. To address this, lightweight finetuning techniques have been proposed, like learning low-rank adapter layers. These methods aim to train only a few additional parameters combined with the base model, which remains frozen, reducing resource usage and mitigating overfitting risks. In this work, we propose an adaptor model based on stochastic gates that simultaneously sparsify the frozen base model with task-specific adaptation. Our method comes with a small number of trainable parameters and allows us to speed up the base model inference with competitive accuracy. We evaluate it in additional variants by equipping it with additional low-rank parameters and comparing it to several recent baselines. Our results show that the proposed method improves the finetuned model accuracy comparatively to the several baselines and allows the removal of up to 20-40\% without significant accuracy loss.</p></details> |  |

However, while these advancements focus on reducing business costs and improving customer satisfaction, limited attention has been given to the experiences of customer service agents, who are critical to the service ecosystem. A major challenge faced by agents is the stress caused by unnecessary emotional exhaustion from harmful texts, which not only impairs their efficiency but also negatively affects customer satisfaction and business outcomes. In this work, we propose an LLM-powered system designed to enhance the working conditions of customer service agents by addressing emotionally intensive communications. Our proposed system leverages LLMs to transform the tone of customer messages, preserving actionable content while mitigating the emotional impact on human agents. Furthermore, the application is implemented as a Chrome extension, making it highly adaptable and easy to integrate into existing systems. Our method aims to enhance the overall service experience for businesses, customers, and agents.</p></details> |  |

Their utility is often bottlenecked by the lack of interaction with the external digital environment. To overcome this limitation and achieve integration of LLMs and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into real-world applications, customized AI agents are being constructed. Based on the technological trends and techniques, we extract a high-level approach for constructing these AI agents, focusing on their underlying architecture. This thesis serves as a comprehensive guide that elucidates a multi-faceted approach for empowering LLMs with the capability to leverage Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). We present a 7-step methodology that begins with the selection of suitable LLMs and the task decomposition that is necessary for complex problem-solving. This methodology includes techniques for generating training data for API interactions and heuristics for selecting the appropriate API among a plethora of options. These steps eventually lead to the generation of API calls that are both syntactically and semantically aligned with the LLM's understanding of a given task. Moreover, we review existing frameworks and tools that facilitate these processes and highlight the gaps in current attempts. In this direction, we propose an on-device architecture that aims to exploit the functionality of carry-on devices by using small models from the Hugging Face community.

However, the misinformation in external documents may mislead LLMs' generation. To address this issue, we explore the task of "credibility-aware RAG", in which LLMs automatically adjust the influence of retrieved documents based on their credibility scores to counteract misinformation. To this end, we introduce a plug-and-play method named $\textbf{Cr}$edibility-aware $\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{M}$odification (CrAM). CrAM identifies influential attention heads in LLMs and adjusts their attention weights based on the credibility of the documents, thereby reducing the impact of low-credibility documents. Experiments on Natual Questions and TriviaQA using Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen1.5-7B show that CrAM improves the RAG performance of LLMs against misinformation pollution by over 20%, even surpassing supervised fine-tuning methods.</p></details> | AAAI25 camera-ready |

However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to AAAI 2025. 14 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

An Evaluation of GPT-Family LLMs on QuixBugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10033v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have long demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in automatic program repair (APR), with OpenAI's ChatGPT being one of the most widely used models in this domain. Through continuous iterations and upgrades of GPT-family models, their performance in fixing bugs has already reached state-of-the-art levels. However, there are few works comparing the effectiveness and variations of different versions of GPT-family models on APR. In this work, inspired by the recent public release of the GPT-o1 models, we conduct the first study to compare the effectiveness of different versions of the GPT-family models in APR. We evaluate the performance of the latest version of the GPT-family models (i.e., O1-preview and O1-mini), GPT-4o, and the historical version of ChatGPT on APR. We conduct an empirical study of the four GPT-family models against other LLMs and APR techniques on the QuixBugs benchmark from multiple evaluation perspectives, including repair success rate, repair cost, response length, and behavior patterns. The results demonstrate that O1's repair capability exceeds that of prior GPT-family models, successfully fixing all 40 bugs in the benchmark. Our work can serve as a foundation for further in-depth exploration of the applications of GPT-family models in APR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th International Workshop on Automated Program Repair (APR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Character-Level Understanding in LLMs through Token Internal Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17679v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization methods like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) enhance computational efficiency in large language models (LLMs) but often obscure internal character structures within tokens. This limitation hinders LLMs' ability to predict precise character positions, which is crucial in tasks like Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) where identifying the positions of misspelled characters accelerates correction processes. We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models' ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text. Furthermore, when applied to downstream tasks that do not require exact position prediction, TIPA still boosts performance in tasks needing character-level information, validating its versatility and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Detection of LLM-Generated Texts: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework with CUDRT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09056v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced text generation, but the human-like quality of LLM outputs presents major challenges in reliably distinguishing between human-authored and LLM-generated texts. Existing detection benchmarks are constrained by their reliance on static datasets, scenario-specific tasks (e.g., question answering and text refinement), and a primary focus on English, overlooking the diverse linguistic and operational subtleties of LLMs. To address these gaps, we propose CUDRT, a comprehensive evaluation framework and bilingual benchmark in Chinese and English, categorizing LLM activities into five key operations: Create, Update, Delete, Rewrite, and Translate. CUDRT provides extensive datasets tailored to each operation, featuring outputs from state-of-the-art LLMs to assess the reliability of LLM-generated text detectors. This framework supports scalable, reproducible experiments and enables in-depth analysis of how operational diversity, multilingual training sets, and LLM architectures influence detection performance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's capacity to optimize detection systems, providing critical insights to enhance reliability, cross-linguistic adaptability, and detection accuracy. By advancing robust methodologies for identifying LLM-generated texts, this work contributes to the development of intelligent systems capable of meeting real-world multilingual detection challenges.

To enable systematic exploration of the CRR capability of LLMs, we first propose a new synthetic benchmark called Generalized Associative Recall (GAR) by integrating and generalizing the essence of several tasks in mechanistic interpretability (MI) study in a unified framework. Evaluation shows that GAR is challenging enough for existing LLMs, revealing their fundamental deficiency in CRR. Meanwhile, it is easy enough for systematic MI study. Then, to understand how LLMs solve GAR tasks, we use attribution patching to discover the core circuits reused by Vicuna-33B across different tasks and a set of vital attention heads. Intervention experiments show that the correct functioning of these heads significantly impacts task performance. Especially, we identify two classes of heads whose activations represent the abstract notion of true and false in GAR tasks respectively. They play a fundamental role in CRR across various models and tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/GAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

Hive operates over sets of models and, upon receiving natural language instructions (i.e. user queries), schedules and executes explainable plans of atomic actions. These actions can involve one or more of the available models to achieve the overall task, while respecting end-users specific constraints. Notably, Hive handles tasks that involve multi-modal inputs and outputs, enabling it to handle complex, real-world queries. Our system is capable of planning complex chains of actions while guaranteeing explainability, using an LLM-based formal logic backbone empowered by PDDL operations. We introduce the MuSE benchmark in order to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-modal capabilities of agent systems. Our findings show that our framework redefines the state-of-the-art for task selection, outperforming other competing systems that plan operations across multiple models while offering transparency guarantees while fully adhering to user constraints.</p></details> | Under review |

Drawing inspiration from the concept of visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous \textit{visual region} within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the possibility of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. We use Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed experiments and LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B for validation across a range of visual and textual tasks. Our findings reveal that selectively updating 25\% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99\% of visual performance while maintaining or enhancing textual task results, and also effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss. This study offers an effective and efficient strategy for LVLM training and inference by activating a layer-wise visual region within LLMs, which is consistently effective across different models and parameter scales.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have explored calibration techniques, they primarily focus on White-Box LLMs with accessible parameters. Black-Box LLMs, despite their superior performance, pose heightened requirements for calibration techniques due to their API-only interaction constraints. Although recent researches have achieved breakthroughs in black-box LLMs calibration, a systematic survey of these methodologies is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we presents the first comprehensive survey on calibration techniques for black-box LLMs. We first define the Calibration Process of LLMs as comprising two interrelated key steps: Confidence Estimation and Calibration. Second, we conduct a systematic review of applicable methods within black-box settings, and provide insights on the unique challenges and connections in implementing these key steps. Furthermore, we explore typical applications of Calibration Process in black-box LLMs and outline promising future research directions, providing new perspectives for enhancing reliability and human-machine alignment.

Industrial AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to augment human experts' workflows in this specialized domain. Our case study investigated the utility of LLMs in drafting replies to stakeholder inquiries and supporting case handlers. We conducted a preliminary study (observations and interviews), a survey, and a text similarity analysis (LLM-as-a-judge and Semantic Embedding Similarity). We discover that while LLM drafts can streamline workflows, they often require significant modifications to meet the specific demands of maritime communications. Though LLMs are not yet mature enough for safety-critical applications without human oversight, they can serve as valuable augmentative tools. Final decision-making thus must remain with human experts. However, by leveraging the strengths of both humans and LLMs, fostering human-AI collaboration, industries can increase efficiency while maintaining high standards of quality and precision tailored to each case.</p></details> | <details><summary>These...</summary><p>These authors share the first authorship: Tita Alissa Bach (1), Aleksandar Babic (1), Narae Park (1)</p></details> |

This absence can diminish the perceived naturalness of synthesized speech, which is an important criteria when building conversational agents that aim to mimick human behaviours. We show how the insertion of disfluencies can alleviate this shortcoming. The proposed approach involves (1) fine-tuning an LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate various types of disfluencies into LLM-generated utterances and (2) synthesizing those utterances using a text-to-speech model that supports the generation of speech phenomena such as disfluencies. We evaluated the quality of the generated speech across two metrics: intelligibility and perceived spontaneity. We demonstrate through a user study that the insertion of disfluencies significantly increase the perceived spontaneity of the generated speech. This increase came, however, along with a slight reduction in intelligibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages short paper, references and appendix are additional</p></details> |

To address this imbalance, we propose a probing method named XTransplant that explores cross-lingual latent interactions via cross-lingual feed-forward transplantation during inference stage, with the hope of enabling the model to leverage the strengths of both English and non-English languages. Through extensive pilot experiments, we empirically prove that both the multilingual capabilities and cultural adaptability of LLMs hold the potential to be significantly improved by XTransplant, respectively from En -> non-En and non-En -> En, highlighting the underutilization of current LLMs' multilingual potential. And the patterns observed in these pilot experiments further motivate an offline scaling inference strategy, which demonstrates consistent performance improvements in multilingual and culture-aware tasks, sometimes even surpassing multilingual supervised fine-tuning. And we do hope our further analysis and discussion could help gain deeper insights into XTransplant mechanism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting User Behavior in Smart Spaces with LLM-Enhanced Logs and Personalized Prompts (Data Description)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12653v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the intelligence of smart systems, such as smart home, and smart vehicle, and smart grids, critically depends on developing sophisticated planning capabilities that can anticipate the next desired function based on historical interactions. While existing methods view user behaviors as sequential data and apply models like RNNs and Transformers to predict future actions, they often fail to incorporate domain knowledge and capture personalized user preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates LLM-enhanced logs and personalized prompts. Our approach first constructs a graph that captures individual behavior preferences derived from their interaction histories. This graph effectively transforms into a soft continuous prompt that precedes the sequence of user behaviors. Then our approach leverages the vast general knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities of a pretrained LLM to enrich the oversimplified and incomplete log records. By enhancing these logs semantically, our approach better understands the user's actions and intentions, especially for those rare events in the dataset. We evaluate the method across four real-world datasets from both smart vehicle and smart home settings. The findings validate the effectiveness of our LLM-enhanced description and personalized prompt, shedding light on potential ways to advance the intelligence of smart space. Note: While this manuscript provides description of the data, we are \textbf{not} permitted to make these datasets publicly available due to restrictions imposed by the data provider.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Discriminative Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12643v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer have achieved remarkable performance on knowledge graph question-answering (KGQA) tasks. However, LLMs often produce ungrounded subgraph planning or reasoning results in KGQA due to the hallucinatory behavior brought by the generative paradigm, which may hinder the advancement of the LLM-based KGQA model. To deal with the issue, we propose a novel LLM-based Discriminative Reasoning (LDR) method to explicitly model the subgraph retrieval and answer inference process. By adopting discriminative strategies, the proposed LDR method not only enhances the capability of LLMs to retrieve question-related subgraphs but also alleviates the issue of ungrounded reasoning brought by the generative paradigm of LLMs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms multiple strong comparison methods, along with achieving state-of-the-art performance on two widely used WebQSP and CWQ benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address this scalability challenge, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, C$^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). The results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperform nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, a study of LLM users revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at chartsquared.github.io, with ample qualitative examples.</p></details> | Preprint |

Characterizing and Exploring Chain of Evidence in Imperfect Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12632v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucination in LLMs. However, external knowledge is often imperfect. In addition to useful knowledge, external knowledge is rich in irrelevant or misinformation in the context that can impair the reliability of LLM responses. This paper focuses on LLMs' preferred external knowledge in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA. Inspired by criminal procedural law's Chain of Evidence (CoE), we characterize that knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among knowledge pieces. Accordingly, we propose an automated CoE discrimination approach and explore LLMs' preferences from their effectiveness, faithfulness and robustness, as well as CoE's usability in a naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) case. The evaluation on five LLMs reveals that CoE enhances LLMs through more accurate generation, stronger answer faithfulness, better robustness against knowledge conflict, and improved performance in a popular RAG case.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Some approaches train LLMs using their own generated synthetic data, exploring the possibility of active alignment. However, there is still a huge gap between these one-time alignment methods and the continuous automatic alignment of humans. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{I-SHEEP}, an \textbf{I}terative \textbf{S}elf-En\textbf{H}anc\textbf{E}m\textbf{E}nt \textbf{P}aradigm.This human-like paradigm enables LLMs to \textbf{continuously self-align from scratch with nothing}. Compared to the one-time alignment method Dromedary \cite{sun2023principledriven}, which refers to the first iteration in this paper, I-SHEEP can significantly enhance capacities on both Qwen and Llama models. I-SHEEP achieves a maximum relative improvement of 78.2\% in the Alpaca Eval, 24.0\% in the MT Bench, and an absolute increase of 8.88\% in the IFEval accuracy over subsequent iterations in Qwen-1.5 72B model. Additionally, I-SHEEP surpasses the base model in various standard benchmark generation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 24.77\% in code generation tasks, 12.04\% in TrivialQA, and 20.29\% in SQuAD. We also provide new insights based on the experiment results. Our codes, datasets, and models are available at \textbf{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SHEEP}.</p></details> |  |

Recently, their effectiveness as embedding models has gained attention, marking a paradigm shift from traditional encoder-only models like ELMo and BERT to decoder-only, large-scale LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. This survey provides an in-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques before the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main strategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly discuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving competitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that affect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training objectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced methods, such as handling longer texts, and multilingual and cross-modal data. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding models, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings, pooling strategies, and scaling law. Lastly, the survey highlights the limitations and challenges in adapting LLMs for embeddings, including cross-task embedding quality, trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, low-resource, long-context, data bias, robustness, etc. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by synthesizing current advancements, highlighting key challenges, and offering a comprehensive framework for future work aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs as embedding models.</p></details> | 32 pages |

While techniques, such as quantization and acceleration algorithms, like FlashAttention, have improved efficiency of the overall inference, they address different aspects of the problem: quantization focuses on weight-activation operations, while FlashAttention improves execution but requires high-precision formats. Recent Key-value (KV) cache quantization reduces memory bandwidth but still needs floating-point dequantization for attention operation. We present TurboAttention, a comprehensive approach to enable quantized execution of attention that simultaneously addresses both memory and computational efficiency. Our solution introduces two key innovations: FlashQ, a headwise attention quantization technique that enables both compression of KV cache and quantized execution of activation-activation multiplication, and Sparsity-based Softmax Approximation (SAS), which eliminates the need for dequantization to FP32 during exponentiation operation in attention. Experimental results demonstrate that TurboAttention achieves 1.2-1.8x speedup in attention, reduces the KV cache size by over 4.4x, and enables up to 2.37x maximum throughput over the FP16 baseline while outperforming state-of-the-art quantization and compression techniques across various datasets and models.</p></details> |  |

Drawing inspiration from the concept of curriculum learning, we have delved into refining LLMs into proficient GEC experts by devising effective curriculum learning (CL) strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, termed LLM-based curriculum learning, which capitalizes on the robust semantic comprehension and discriminative prowess inherent in LLMs to gauge the complexity of GEC training data. Unlike traditional curriculum learning techniques, our method closely mirrors human expert-designed curriculums. Leveraging the proposed LLM-based CL method, we sequentially select varying levels of curriculums ranging from easy to hard, and iteratively train and refine using the pretrianed T5 and LLaMA series models. Through rigorous testing and analysis across diverse benchmark assessments in English GEC, including the CoNLL14 test, BEA19 test, and BEA19 development sets, our approach showcases a significant performance boost over baseline models and conventional curriculum learning methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Derek...</summary><p>Derek F.

A common approach involves using a fixed decision tree as one player's strategy while training an RL agent as the opponent to identify vulnerabilities in the decision tree, thereby improving its strategic strength iteratively. However, this process often requires significant human intervention to refine the decision tree after identifying its weaknesses, resulting in inefficiencies and hindering full automation of the strategy enhancement process. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative opportunity to automate the process. We propose RL-LLM-DT, an automatic decision tree generation method based on RL Evaluation and LLM Enhancement. Given an initial decision tree, the method involves two important iterative steps. Response Policy Search: RL is used to discover counter-strategies targeting the decision tree. Policy Improvement: LLMs analyze failure scenarios and generate improved decision tree code. In our method, RL focuses on finding the decision tree's flaws while LLM is prompted to generate an improved version of the decision tree. The iterative refinement process terminates when RL can't find any flaw of the tree or LLM fails to improve the tree. To evaluate the effectiveness of this integrated approach, we conducted experiments in a curling game. After iterative refinements, our curling AI based on the decision tree ranks first on the Jidi platform among 34 curling AIs in total, which demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance the robustness and adaptability of decision trees, representing a substantial advancement in the field of Game AI.

Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12509v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations. This work provides a crucial step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLM-based systems and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting LLM-based Relevance Modeling with Distribution-Aware Robust Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12504v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling, resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference. First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the Alipay's insurance product search...</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[A System for Microserving of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12488v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advances in LLMs bring a strong demand for efficient system support to improve overall serving efficiency. As LLM inference scales towards multiple GPUs and even multiple compute nodes, various coordination patterns, such as prefill-decode disaggregation and context migration, arise in serving systems. Most inference services today expose a coarse-grained request-level API with a pre-configured coordination strategy, limiting the ability to customize and dynamically reconfigure the coordination. In this paper, we propose LLM microserving, a multi-level architecture for structuring and programming LLM inference services. We introduces simple yet effective microserving APIs to support fine-grained sub-request level actions. A programmable router transforms user requests into sub-request calls, enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of serving patterns. To support diverse execution patterns, we develop a unified KV cache interface that handles various KV compute, transfer, and reuse scenarios. Our evaluation shows that LLM microserving can be reconfigured to support multiple disaggregation orchestration strategies in a few lines of Python code while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for LLM inference tasks. Additionally, it allows us to explore new strategy variants that reduce up to 47% of job completion time compared to the existing strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional KG-based recommendation methods face fundamental challenges: insufficient consideration of temporal information and poor performance in cold-start scenarios. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be considered databases with a wealth of knowledge learned from the web data, and they have recently gained attention due to their potential application as recommendation systems. Although approaches that treat LLMs as recommendation systems can leverage LLMs' high recommendation literacy, their input token limitations make it impractical to consider the entire recommendation domain dataset and result in scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge graph Reasoning model (LIKR). Our main idea is to treat LLMs as reasoners that output intuitive exploration strategies for KGs. To integrate the knowledge of LLMs and KGs, we trained a recommendation agent through reinforcement learning using a reward function that integrates different recommendation strategies, including LLM's intuition and KG embeddings. By incorporating temporal awareness through prompt engineering and generating textual representations of user preferences from limited interactions, LIKR can improve recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, LIKR can avoid scalability issues by using KGs to represent recommendation domain datasets and limiting the LLM's output to KG exploration strategies. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation methods in cold-start sequential recommendation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR2025)</p></details> |
| **[LITA: An Efficient LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12459v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topic modeling is widely used for uncovering thematic structures within text corpora, yet traditional models often struggle with specificity and coherence in domain-focused applications. Guided approaches, such as SeededLDA and CorEx, incorporate user-provided seed words to improve relevance but remain labor-intensive and static. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for dynamic topic refinement and discovery, yet their application often incurs high API costs. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation framework (LITA), an LLM-assisted approach that integrates user-provided seeds with embedding-based clustering and iterative refinement. LITA identifies a small number of ambiguous documents and employs an LLM to reassign them to existing or new topics, minimizing API costs while enhancing topic quality. Experiments on two datasets across topic quality and clustering performance metrics demonstrate that LITA outperforms five baseline models, including LDA, SeededLDA, CorEx, BERTopic, and PromptTopic. Our work offers an efficient and adaptable framework for advancing topic modeling and text clustering.</p></details> | Under Review |

The core of this new graph learning paradigm lies in the synergistic combination of GNNs' ability to capture complex structural relationships and LLMs' proficiency in understanding informative contexts from the rich textual descriptions of graphs. Therefore, we can leverage graph description texts with rich semantic context to fundamentally enhance Data quality, thereby improving the representational capacity of model-centric approaches in line with data-centric machine learning principles. By leveraging the strengths of these distinct neural network architectures, this integrated approach addresses a wide range of TAG-based Task (e.g., graph learning, graph reasoning, and graph question answering), particularly in complex industrial scenarios (e.g., supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings). In other words, we can treat text as a medium to enable cross-domain generalization of graph learning Model, allowing a single graph model to effectively handle the diversity of downstream graph-based Task across different data domains. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners looking to advance graph learning methodologies in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM.

This paper addresses these disparities by creating approximately 1 million human-translated words of new benchmark data in 8 low-resource African languages, covering a population of over 160 million speakers of: Amharic, Bambara, Igbo, Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Shona, Sesotho (Southern Sotho), Setswana, and Tsonga. Our benchmarks are translations of Winogrande and three sections of MMLU: college medicine, clinical knowledge, and virology. Using the translated benchmarks, we report previously unknown performance gaps between state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs in English and African languages. Finally, using results from over 400 fine-tuned models, we explore several methods to reduce the LLM performance gap, including high-quality dataset fine-tuning (using an LLM-as-an-Annotator), cross-lingual transfer, and cultural appropriateness adjustments. Key findings include average mono-lingual improvements of 5.6% with fine-tuning (with 5.4% average mono-lingual improvements when using high-quality data over low-quality data), 2.9% average gains from cross-lingual transfer, and a 3.0% out-of-the-box performance boost on culturally appropriate questions. The publicly available benchmarks, translations, and code from this study support further research and development aimed at creating more inclusive and effective language technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025.

Although recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved Table QA performance, their explanations for how the answers are generated are ambiguous. To fill this gap, we introduce Plan-of-SQLs ( or POS), an interpretable, effective, and efficient approach to Table QA that answers an input query solely with SQL executions. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations with human and LLM judges, we show that POS is most preferred among explanation methods, helps human users understand model decision boundaries, and facilitates model success and error identification. Furthermore, when evaluated in standard benchmarks (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FetaQA), POS achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, while maintaining greater efficiency by requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and database queries.</p></details> |  |

We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.</p></details> |  |

A Behavioral Evaluation of LLM-Agents in Dictator Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21359v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly undertake real-world tasks and engage with human society, how well do we understand their behaviors? We (1) investigate how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors -- a fundamental social norm -- can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduce a behavioral and social science approach to evaluate LLM agents' decision-making. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal substantial variations and inconsistencies among LLMs and notable differences compared to human behaviors. Merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. Despite being trained on extensive human-generated data, these AI agents are unable to capture the internal processes of human decision-making. Their alignment with human is highly variable and dependent on specific model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. LLMs can be useful task-specific tools but are not yet intelligent human-like agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition of LLMs via Progressive Vocabulary Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12310v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the critical need for democratizing large language models (LLM) in the Arab world, a region that has seen slower progress in developing models comparable to state-of-the-art offerings like GPT-4 or ChatGPT 3.5, due to a predominant focus on mainstream languages (e.g., English and Chinese). One practical objective for an Arabic LLM is to utilize an Arabic-specific vocabulary for the tokenizer that could speed up decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to a degradation of learned knowledge since many words are initially out-of-vocabulary (OOV) when training starts. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion. Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks. Models, training data, benchmarks, and codes will be all open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12039v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs for Cold-Start Cutting Plane Separator Configuration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12038v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers ship with a staggering number of parameters that are challenging to select a priori for all but expert optimization users, but can have an outsized impact on the performance of the MILP solver. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches to configure solvers require training ML models by solving thousands of related MILP instances, generalize poorly to new problem sizes, and often require implementing complex ML pipelines and custom solver interfaces that can be difficult to integrate into existing optimization workflows. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM-based framework to configure which cutting plane separators to use for a given MILP problem with little to no training data based on characteristics of the instance, such as a natural language description of the problem and the associated LaTeX formulation. We augment these LLMs with descriptions of cutting plane separators available in a given solver, grounded by summarizing the existing research literature on separators. While individual solver configurations have a large variance in performance, we present a novel ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates configurations to create a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our LLM-based methodology requires no custom solver interface, can find a high-performing configuration by solving only a small number of MILPs, and can generate the configuration with simple API calls that run in under a second. Numerical results show our approach is competitive with existing configuration approaches on a suite of classic combinatorial optimization problems and real-world datasets with only a fraction of the training data and computation time.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs, the question now becomes a matter of scale: can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed? To this end, we introduce RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP-LX follows participatory design practices, and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally-specific toxic language. We evaluate 10 S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally-sensitive, multilingual scenario. We find that, although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy, they have low agreement with human judges when scoring holistically the toxicity of a prompt; and have difficulty discerning harm in context-dependent scenarios, particularly with subtle-yet-harmful content (e.g. microaggressions, bias). We release this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025--camera ready + extended abstract</p></details> |
| **[The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12004v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their "black box" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.</p></details> | 7 pages, 0 figures |

Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer "0.5," which does not make sense. While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of "0.5 child." Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding. However, this is inconsistent. These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty. We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions. We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-Effective Label-free Node Classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11983v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as go-to models for node classification in graph data due to their powerful abilities in fusing graph structures and attributes. However, such models strongly rely on adequate high-quality labeled data for training, which are expensive to acquire in practice. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), a promising way is to leverage their superb zero-shot capabilities and massive knowledge for node labeling. Despite promising results reported, this methodology either demands considerable queries to LLMs, or suffers from compromised performance caused by noisy labels produced by LLMs. To remedy these issues, this work presents Cella, an active self-training framework that integrates LLMs into GNNs in a cost-effective manner. The design recipe of Cella is to iteratively identify small sets of "critical" samples using GNNs and extract informative pseudo-labels for them with both LLMs and GNNs as additional supervision signals to enhance model training. Particularly, Cella includes three major components: (i) an effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a judicious sample selection scheme to sift out the "critical" nodes based on label disharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module combining LLMs and GNNs with rewired topology. Our extensive experiments over five benchmark text-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Cella significantly outperforms the state of the arts under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of label-free node classification. In particular, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes, Cella is able to achieve an 8.08% conspicuous improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a cost of less than one cent.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.</p></details> |  |

Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the misuse of LLM-generated (synthetic) code has raised concerns in both educational and industrial contexts, underscoring the urgent need for synthetic code detectors. Existing methods for detecting synthetic content are primarily designed for general text and struggle with code due to the unique grammatical structure of programming languages and the presence of numerous ''low-entropy'' tokens. Building on this, our work proposes a novel zero-shot synthetic code detector based on the similarity between the original code and its LLM-rewritten variants. Our method is based on the observation that differences between LLM-rewritten and original code tend to be smaller when the original code is synthetic. We utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to train a code similarity model and evaluate our approach on two synthetic code detection benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement over existing SOTA synthetic content detectors, with AUROC scores increasing by 20.5% on the APPS benchmark and 29.1% on the MBPP benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025; previously submitted to EMNLP 2023</p></details> |

To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leading to the emergence of "LLM-as-a-Judge," where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks. With their ability to process diverse data types and provide scalable, cost-effective, and consistent assessments, LLMs present a compelling alternative to traditional expert-driven evaluations. However, ensuring the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems remains a significant challenge that requires careful design and standardization. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLM-as-a-Judge, addressing the core question: How can reliable LLM-as-a-Judge systems be built? We explore strategies to enhance reliability, including improving consistency, mitigating biases, and adapting to diverse assessment scenarios. Additionally, we propose methodologies for evaluating the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, supported by a novel benchmark designed for this purpose. To advance the development and real-world deployment of LLM-as-a-Judge systems, we also discussed practical applications, challenges, and future directions.

Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an availability bias (Tversky and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the discovery of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materializing an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. As a prototype, we employ GPT-4o-mini to construct GPTKB, a large-scale knowledge base (KB) comprising 105 million triples for over 2.9 million entities - achieved at 1% of the cost of previous KB projects. This work marks a milestone in two areas: For LLM research, for the first time, it provides constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLMs' knowledge (or beliefs). For KB construction, it pioneers new pathways for the long-standing challenge of general-domain KB construction.

In this work, we introduce (1) a real-time strategy game benchmark designed to evaluate these abilities and (2) a novel framework we term HIVE. HIVE empowers a single human to coordinate swarms of up to 2,000 agents using natural language dialog with an LLM. We present promising results on this multi-agent benchmark, with our hybrid approach solving tasks such as coordinating agent movements, exploiting unit weaknesses, leveraging human annotations, and understanding terrain and strategic points. However, our findings also highlight critical limitations of current models, including difficulties in processing spatial visual information and challenges in formulating long-term strategic plans. This work sheds light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in human-swarm coordination, paving the way for future research in this area.

In this work, we propose a new form of questioner-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different questioners. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-questioner general encoder and a questioner-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same questioner, while pulling apart those of different questioners. To mitigate the impact of question diversity on questioner-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on question similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. We also build a multi-questioner dataset from English and Chinese scripts and WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 questioners and 12 responders. Extensive evaluation with different metrics shows a significant improvement in the quality of personalized response generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step-Calibrated Diffusion for Biomedical Optical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13680v4)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality, high-resolution medical imaging is essential for clinical care. Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/restorative_step-calibrated_diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Degradation Representation Learning for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12848v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods have demonstrated effective performance on a single degradation type. In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |
| **[TSD-SR: One-Step Diffusion with Target Score Distillation for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18263v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08939v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable yet challenging approach that enhances a compact student network by learning from a high-performance but cumbersome teacher model. However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Diffusion: Denoising Diffusion Model with Data-Consistent Training for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12550v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the limitations of denoising diffusion models (DDMs) in image restoration tasks, particularly the shape and color distortions that can compromise image quality. While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Transformer-Based Blind-Spot Network for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07846v3)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind-spot networks (BSN) have been prevalent neural architectures in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[Haar Nuclear Norms with Applications to Remote Sensing Imagery Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08509v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruct-IPT: All-in-One Image Processing Transformer via Weight Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00676v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unaffordable size and intensive computation costs of low-level vision models, All-in-One models that are designed to address a handful of low-level vision tasks simultaneously have been popular. However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Matrix Completion via Residual Spectral Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10005v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy matrix completion has attracted significant attention due to its applications in recommendation systems, signal processing and image restoration. Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Context-aware Convolutional Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11008v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) is a long-standing task to recover a high-quality image from its corrupted observation. Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting ViT-based MRI Reconstruction from the Perspectives of Frequency Modulation, Spatial Purification, and Scale Diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10776v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accelerated MRI reconstruction process presents a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the extensive under-sampling in k-space. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Conditional Latent Diffusion Models Effective for Image Restoration?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09324v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image restoration increasingly employ conditional latent diffusion models (CLDMs). While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[OFTSR: One-Step Flow for Image Super-Resolution with Tunable Fidelity-Realism Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09465v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion and flow-based generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in image restoration tasks, achieving superior perceptual quality compared to traditional deep learning approaches. However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/yuanzhi-zhu/OFTSR and https://huggingface.co/Yuanzhi/OFTSR, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that rely on local blur detection often suffer from inaccuracies and cannot generate satisfactory results when focusing solely on blurred regions. To overcome these problems, we first design a context-based local blur detection module that incorporates additional contextual information to improve the identification of blurry regions. Considering that modern smartphones are equipped with cameras capable of providing short-exposure images, we develop a blur-aware guided image restoration method that utilizes sharp structural details from short-exposure images, facilitating accurate reconstruction of heavily blurred regions. Furthermore, to restore images realistically and visually-pleasant, we develop a short-exposure guided diffusion model that explores useful features from short-exposure images and blurred regions to better constrain the diffusion process. Finally, we formulate the above components into a simple yet effective network, named ExpRDiff. Experimental results show that ExpRDiff performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/yzb1997/ExpRDiff</p></details> |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Real&Synthetic Dataset and Linear Attention in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03814v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) aims to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs, with recent deep learning advancements significantly enhancing performance. However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17778v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

| **[Modeling Dual-Exposure Quad-Bayer Patterns for Joint Denoising and Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07256v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image degradation caused by noise and blur remains a persistent challenge in imaging systems, stemming from limitations in both hardware and methodology. Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images.

| **[EchoIR: Advancing Image Restoration with Echo Upsampling and Bi-Level Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07225v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration represents a fundamental challenge in low-level vision, focusing on reconstructing high-quality images from their degraded counterparts. With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Progressive Image Restoration Network for High-order Degradation Imaging in Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07195v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning methods have gained remarkable achievements in the field of image restoration for remote sensing (RS). However, most existing RS image restoration methods focus mainly on conventional first-order degradation models, which may not effectively capture the imaging mechanisms of remote sensing images. Furthermore, many RS image restoration approaches that use deep learning are often criticized for their lacks of architecture transparency and model interpretability. To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing methods often struggle with slow processing times and suboptimal restoration, especially under severe degradation, failing to accurately reconstruct finer-level identity details. To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full diffusion processes or per-identity model tuning, InstantRestore offers a scalable solution suitable for large-scale applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstantRestore outperforms existing methods in quality and speed, making it an appealing choice for identity-preserving face restoration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/InstantRestore/</p></details> |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

While recent diffusion-based restoration methods, which leverage generative priors from text-to-image models, have made progress in recovering more realistic details, they still encounter "generative capability deactivation" when applied to out-of-distribution real-world data. To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures. Additionally, we present RealIR, a new benchmark designed to capture diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Res-Captioner significantly enhances the generalization abilities of diffusion-based restoration models, while remaining fully plug-and-play.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs could be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), we propose ReF-LDM, an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our model integrates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, to leverage the reference images during the generation process. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling our LDM-based model to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset consisting of 20,405 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024, project page https://chiweihsiao.github.io/refldm.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Equivariant Denoisers for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05343v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Moreover, typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose a unified framework named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of this algorithm and discuss its practical benefit.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaFormer: High-fidelity Metalens Imaging via Aberration Correcting Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04591v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metalens is an emerging optical system with an irreplaceable merit in that it can be manufactured in ultra-thin and compact sizes, which shows great promise of various applications such as medical imaging and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction. We conduct extensive experiments, including correcting aberrated images and videos, and clean 3D reconstruction from the degraded images. The proposed method outperforms the previous arts by a significant margin. We further fabricate a metalens and verify the practicality of MetaFormer by restoring the images captured with the manufactured metalens in the wild.

| **[Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04130v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Underwater Image Restoration using Co-Operational Regressor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03995v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of underwater environments is essential for applications such as biological research, archaeology, and infrastructure maintenanceHowever, underwater imaging is challenging due to the waters unique properties, including scattering, absorption, color distortion, and reduced visibility. To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application. Our results and the optimized PyTorch implementation of the proposed approach are now publicly shared on GitHub.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[LL-ICM: Image Compression for Low-level Machine Vision via Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03841v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous image restoration (IR) methods have often concentrated on isolated degradations, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations involving a complex combination of multiple isolated degradations. However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Prior for Diffusion-Based Real-World Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02960v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) has achieved a remarkable leap by leveraging large-scale text-to-image models, enabling realistic image restoration from given recognition textual prompts. However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

This degradation negatively affects the performance of autonomous underwater vehicles used in marine applications. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight phase-based transformer network with 1.77M parameters for underwater image restoration (UIR). Our approach focuses on effectively extracting non-contaminated features using a phase-based self-attention mechanism. We also introduce an optimized phase attention block to restore structural information by propagating prominent attentive features from the input. We evaluate our method on both synthetic (UIEB, UFO-120) and real-world (UIEB, U45, UCCS, SQUID) underwater image datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate its effectiveness for low-light image enhancement using the LOL dataset. Through extensive ablation studies and comparative analysis, it is clear that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models. Specifically, we first utilize a diffusion-based generalist model to remove degradations by learning the degradation-agnostic common representations from diverse inputs, where incremental learning strategy is adopted to better guide model training. To refine the model's restoration capability in complex scenarios, we introduce degradation-aware specialist models for achieving final high-quality results. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.foundir.net</p></details> |

Existing methods often depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator linearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability. In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms. Our experiments show that LADiBI is capable of solving a broad range of image restoration tasks, including both linear and nonlinear problems, on diverse target image distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptHSI: Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration Framework for Composite Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15922v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration and prompt learning have enabled the representation of distinct degradations through prompts, allowing degraded images to be effectively addressed by a single restoration model. However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications. The source code and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Information Flow for Generalized Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18588v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision transformers show promise in numerous image restoration (IR) tasks, the challenge remains in efficiently generalizing and scaling up a model for multiple IR tasks. To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity Experts are Task-Discriminative Learners for Any Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18466v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in all-in-one image restoration models have revolutionized the ability to address diverse degradations through a unified framework. However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v2)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/loraapage/</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MWFormer: Multi-Weather Image Restoration Using Degradation-Aware Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17226v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restoring images captured under adverse weather conditions is a fundamental task for many computer vision applications. However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> |  |

However, in real-world scenarios, images often suffer from combinations of multiple degradation factors. Existing multiple-in-one IR models encounter challenges related to degradation diversity and prompt singularity when addressing this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-in-one IR model that can effectively restore images with both single and mixed degradations. To address degradation diversity, we design a Local Dynamic Optimization (LDO) module which dynamically processes degraded areas of varying types and granularities. To tackle the prompt singularity issue, we develop an efficient Conditional Feature Embedding (CFE) module that guides the decoder in leveraging degradation-type-related features, significantly improving the model's performance in mixed degradation restoration scenarios. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we introduce a new dataset containing both single and mixed degradation elements. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance not only on mixed degradation tasks but also on classic single-task restoration benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The video data obtained from these telescopes differ significantly from data for standard 3D reconstruction tasks, characterized by intense motion blur, atmospheric turbulence, pervasive background light pollution, extended focal length and constrained observational perspectives. To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Unsupervised Underwater Neural Radiance Field U2NeRF, a transformer-based architecture that learns to render and restore novel views conditioned on multi-view geometry simultaneously. Due to the absence of supervision, we attempt to implicitly bake restoring capabilities onto the NeRF pipeline and disentangle the predicted color into several components - scene radiance, direct transmission map, backscatter transmission map, and global background light, and when combined reconstruct the underwater image in a self-supervised manner. In addition, we release an Underwater View Synthesis UVS dataset consisting of 12 underwater scenes, containing both synthetically-generated and real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate that when optimized on a single scene, U2NeRF outperforms several baselines by as much LPIPS 11%, UIQM 5%, UCIQE 4% (on average) and showcases improved rendering and restoration capabilities.

Unlike Retinex-based methods, our approach utilizes two color spaces - LAB and YUV - to efficiently separate and process color information, by leveraging the separation of luminance from chromatic components in color images. In addition, our model incorporates the Transformer architecture to comprehensively understand image content while maintaining computational efficiency. To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics and datasets, achieving more natural color restoration and a balanced brightness distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration Under Adverse Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16739v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Removing adverse weather conditions such as rain, raindrop, and snow from images is critical for various real-world applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and remote sensing. However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Specifically, our method achieves PSNR scores of 29.22 on the Raindrop dataset, 30.76 on the Rain dataset, and 29.56 on the Snow100K dataset.

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

| **[Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |

However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other blinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The cloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus images, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which brings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper establishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It contains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration model, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully unsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style and texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm. Meanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the quality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from synthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res outperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and SSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that Catintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images from various datasets. We hope the models can help ophthalmologists identify other blinding eye diseases of cataract patients and inspire more medical image restoration methods in the future.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved.

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 3 tables |

To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

| **[All-in-one Weather-degraded Image Restoration via Adaptive Degradation-aware Self-prompting Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07445v1)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration suffer from inefficiencies in leveraging degradation-aware priors, resulting in sub-optimal performance in adapting to different weather conditions. To this end, we develop an adaptive degradation-aware self-prompting model (ADSM) for all-in-one weather-degraded image restoration. Specifically, our model employs the contrastive language-image pre-training model (CLIP) to facilitate the training of our proposed latent prompt generators (LPGs), which represent three types of latent prompts to characterize the degradation type, degradation property and image caption. Moreover, we integrate the acquired degradation-aware prompts into the time embedding of diffusion model to improve degradation perception. Meanwhile, we employ the latent caption prompt to guide the reverse sampling process using the cross-attention mechanism, thereby guiding the accurate image reconstruction. Furthermore, to accelerate the reverse sampling procedure of diffusion model and address the limitations of frequency perception, we introduce a wavelet-oriented noise estimating network (WNE-Net). Extensive experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both task-specific and all-in-one applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Frequency Enhancement Network for Blind Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06893v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image deblurring is an essential image preprocessing technique, aiming to recover clear and detailed images form blurry ones. However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring. To capture the multi-scale spatial and channel information of blurred images, we introduce a multi-scale feature extraction module (MS-FE) based on depthwise separable convolutions, which provides rich target features for deblurring. We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in downstream object detection tasks, the proposed blind image deblurring algorithm significantly improves detection accuracy, further validating its effectiveness androbustness in the field of image deblurring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dropout the High-rate Downsampling: A Novel Design Paradigm for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06456v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularization of high-end mobile devices, Ultra-high-definition (UHD) images have become ubiquitous in our lives. The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive experiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | WACV2025 |
| **[A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05993v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2024</p></details> |

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Failu...</summary><p>Failure to meet expectations</p></details> |

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4x super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Chasing-Better-DIPs</p></details> |

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining.

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN & DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps.

Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility.

However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects.

AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |

Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level.

| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike. This paper stands as the first comprehensive and insightful review of AiOIR. A related repository is available at https://github.com/Harbinzzy/All-in-One-Image-Restoration-Survey.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Our research focuses on reducing the labor costs in the above process by harnessing the potential of increasingly powerful generative AI. Using video diffusion models as the foundation, AniDoc emerges as a video line art colorization tool, which automatically converts sketch sequences into colored animations following the reference character specification. Our model exploits correspondence matching as an explicit guidance, yielding strong robustness to the variations (e.g., posture) between the reference character and each line art frame. In addition, our model could even automate the in-betweening process, such that users can easily create a temporally consistent animation by simply providing a character image as well as the start and end sketches.

We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables diverse zero-shot applications in one unified model. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/baaivision/NOVA.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |
| **[E-CAR: Efficient Continuous Autoregressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14170v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for image generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete tokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their sequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive diffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive Image Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these limitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous token generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides progressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a multistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only partial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in normal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at increasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage. This design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of the stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our approach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally with image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and following a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details. Experimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to DiT Peebles & Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 5$\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\times$256 image.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoDPO: Omni-Preference Alignment for Video Diffusion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14167v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative diffusion models has greatly advanced text-to-video generation. While text-to-video models trained on large-scale, diverse datasets can produce varied outputs, these generations often deviate from user preferences, highlighting the need for preference alignment on pre-trained models. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant improvements in language and image generation, we pioneer its adaptation to video diffusion models and propose a VideoDPO pipeline by making several key adjustments. Unlike previous image alignment methods that focus solely on either (i) visual quality or (ii) semantic alignment between text and videos, we comprehensively consider both dimensions and construct a preference score accordingly, which we term the OmniScore. We design a pipeline to automatically collect preference pair data based on the proposed OmniScore and discover that re-weighting these pairs based on the score significantly impacts overall preference alignment. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment, ensuring that no preference aspect is neglected. Code and data will be shared at https://videodpo.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCMat: Multiview-Consistent and Physically Accurate PBR Material Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14148v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 2D methods utilize UNet-based diffusion models to generate multi-view physically-based rendering (PBR) maps but struggle with multi-view inconsistency, while some 3D methods directly generate UV maps, encountering generalization issues due to the limited 3D data. To address these problems, we propose a two-stage approach, including multi-view generation and UV materials refinement. In the generation stage, we adopt a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model to generate PBR materials, where both the specially designed multi-branch DiT and reference-based DiT blocks adopt a global attention mechanism to promote feature interaction and fusion between different views, thereby improving multi-view consistency. In addition, we adopt a PBR-based diffusion loss to ensure that the generated materials align with realistic physical principles. In the refinement stage, we propose a material-refined DiT that performs inpainting in empty areas and enhances details in UV space. Except for the normal condition, this refinement also takes the material map from the generation stage as an additional condition to reduce the learning difficulty and improve generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in texturing 3D objects with PBR materials and provides significant advantages for graphics relighting applications.

Although significant advances have been made in image-based virtual try-on, extending these successes to video often leads to frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Some approaches have attempted to address this by increasing the overlap of frames across multiple video chunks, but this comes at a steep computational cost due to the repeated processing of the same frames, especially for long video sequences. To tackle these challenges, we reconceptualize video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, with garments serving as input conditions. Specifically, our approach enhances image diffusion models by incorporating temporal attention layers to improve temporal coherence. To reduce computational overhead, we propose ShiftCaching, a novel technique that maintains temporal consistency while minimizing redundant computations. Furthermore, we introduce the TikTokDress dataset, a new video try-on dataset featuring more complex backgrounds, challenging movements, and higher resolution compared to existing public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current baselines, particularly in terms of video consistency and inference speed.

| **[SurgSora: Decoupled RGBD-Flow Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical video generation has transformative potential for enhancing surgical understanding and pathology insights through precise and controllable visual representations. However, current models face limitations in controllability and authenticity. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgSora, a motion-controllable surgical video generation framework that uses a single input frame and user-controllable motion cues. SurgSora consists of three key modules: the Dual Semantic Injector (DSI), which extracts object-relevant RGB and depth features from the input frame and integrates them with segmentation cues to capture detailed spatial features of complex anatomical structures; the Decoupled Flow Mapper (DFM), which fuses optical flow with semantic-RGB-D features at multiple scales to enhance temporal understanding and object spatial dynamics; and the Trajectory Controller (TC), which allows users to specify motion directions and estimates sparse optical flow, guiding the video generation process. The fused features are used as conditions for a frozen Stable Diffusion model to produce realistic, temporally coherent surgical videos. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SurgSora outperforms state-of-the-art methods in controllability and authenticity, showing its potential to advance surgical video generation for medical education, training, and research.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditionally used embeddings, encodings integrate contextual information. In our approach, we also employ a transformer-based decoder, specifically designed to incorporate context in the token prediction process. We conduct a comprehensive examination of the influence of the encoder, decoder, noise scheduler, and self-conditioning on zero-shot generation. Furthermore, we compare TEncDM with previous approaches on three conditional text generation tasks: QQP, XSum, and Wiki-Auto. The results show that TEncDM exhibits superior performance compared to existing non-autoregressive diffusion models.

In this work, we introduce a data-driven methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion model. Trained on a dataset of preexisting airfoils, our model can generate an arbitrary number of new airfoils from random vectors, which can be conditioned on specific aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift and drag, or geometric criteria. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively produces airfoil shapes with realistic aerodynamic properties, offering substantial improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for discovering innovative airfoil designs. This approach significantly expands the design space, facilitating the synthesis of high-performance aerodynamic shapes that transcend the limitations of traditional methods.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 6 figures |
| **[Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Vehicle emissions contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, especially for vulnerable and exposed road users like pedestrians and cyclists. Therefore, accurate air quality monitoring with high spatial resolution is vital for good urban environmental management. This study aims to provide insights for processing spatiotemporal datasets with high missing data rates. In this study, the challenge of high missing data rates is a result of the limited data available and the fine granularity required for precise classification of PM2.5 levels. The data used for analysis and imputation were collected from both mobile sensors and fixed stations by Dynamic Parcel Distribution, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Google in Dublin, Ireland, where the missing data rate was approximately 82.42%, making accurate Particulate Matter 2.5 level predictions particularly difficult. Various imputation and prediction approaches were evaluated and compared, including ensemble methods, deep learning models, and diffusion models. External features such as traffic flow, weather conditions, and data from the nearest stations were incorporated to enhance model performance. The results indicate that diffusion methods with external features achieved the highest F1 score, reaching 0.9486 (Accuracy: 94.26%, Precision: 94.42%, Recall: 94.82%), with ensemble models achieving the highest accuracy of 94.82%, illustrating that good performance can be obtained despite a high missing data rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CIETES 2025, with 8 pages, 3 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL-base, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.

Building on the recent DIFUSCO and T2TCO approaches, we propose IDEQ. IDEQ improves the quality of the solutions by leveraging the constrained structure of the state space of the TSP. Another key component of IDEQ consists in replacing the last stages of DIFUSCO curriculum learning by considering a uniform distribution over the Hamiltonian tours whose orbits by the 2-opt operator converge to the optimal solution as the training objective. Our experiments show that IDEQ improves the state of the art for such neural network based techniques on synthetic instances. More importantly, our experiments show that IDEQ performs very well on the instances of the TSPlib, a reference benchmark in the TSP community: it closely matches the performance of the best heuristics, LKH3, being even able to obtain better solutions than LKH3 on 2 instances of the TSPlib defined on 1577 and 3795 cities. IDEQ obtains 0.3% optimality gap on TSP instances made of 500 cities, and 0.5% on TSP instances with 1000 cities. This sets a new SOTA for neural based methods solving the TSP. Moreover, IDEQ exhibits a lower variance and better scales-up with the number of cities with regards to DIFUSCO and T2TCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Style Diffusion for Generalized Object Detection in Urban Scene](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13815v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in various domains such as autonomous driving and urban scene monitoring. However, deep learning-based approaches often demand large volumes of annotated data, which are costly and difficult to acquire, particularly in complex and unpredictable real-world environments. This dependency significantly hampers the generalization capability of existing object detection techniques. To address this issue, we introduce a novel single-domain object detection generalization method, named GoDiff, which leverages a pre-trained model to enhance generalization in unseen domains. Central to our approach is the Pseudo Target Data Generation (PTDG) module, which employs a latent diffusion model to generate pseudo-target domain data that preserves source domain characteristics while introducing stylistic variations. By integrating this pseudo data with source domain data, we diversify the training dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-style instance normalization technique to blend style features from different domains generated by the PTDG module, thereby increasing the detector's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only enhances the generalization ability of existing detectors but also functions as a plug-and-play enhancement for other single-domain generalization methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The recent studies of model interaction and self-corrective reasoning approach in large language models offer new insights for enhancing text-to-image models. Inspired by these studies, we propose a novel method called ArtAug for enhancing text-to-image models in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, ArtAug is the first one that improves image synthesis models via model interactions with understanding models. In the interactions, we leverage human preferences implicitly learned by image understanding models to provide fine-grained suggestions for image synthesis models. The interactions can modify the image content to make it aesthetically pleasing, such as adjusting exposure, changing shooting angles, and adding atmospheric effects. The enhancements brought by the interaction are iteratively fused into the synthesis model itself through an additional enhancement module. This enables the synthesis model to directly produce aesthetically pleasing images without any extra computational cost. In the experiments, we train the ArtAug enhancement module on existing text-to-image models. Various evaluation metrics consistently demonstrate that ArtAug enhances the generative capabilities of text-to-image models without incurring additional computational costs. The source code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Approximation of Random Evolution Equations of Parabolic type](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretization error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretization in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter--Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups. We apply the abstract framework to an anisotropic diffusion model with random diffusion coefficients.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models Based Conditional Independence Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11744v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional independence (CI) testing is a fundamental task in modern statistics and machine learning. The conditional randomization test (CRT) was recently introduced to test whether two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, are conditionally independent given a potentially high-dimensional set of random variables, $Z$. The CRT operates exceptionally well under the assumption that the conditional distribution $X|Z$ is known. However, since this distribution is typically unknown in practice, accurately approximating it becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose using conditional diffusion models (CDMs) to learn the distribution of $X|Z$. Theoretically and empirically, it is shown that CDMs closely approximate the true conditional distribution. Furthermore, CDMs offer a more accurate approximation of $X|Z$ compared to GANs, potentially leading to a CRT that performs better than those based on GANs. To accommodate complex dependency structures, we utilize a computationally efficient classifier-based conditional mutual information (CMI) estimator as our test statistic. The proposed testing procedure performs effectively without requiring assumptions about specific distribution forms or feature dependencies, and is capable of handling mixed-type conditioning sets that include both continuous and discrete variables. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed test achieves a valid control of the type I error. A series of experiments on synthetic data demonstrates that our new test effectively controls both type-I and type-II errors, even in high dimensional scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, aaai 2025</p></details> |

Our model modifies the lighting and color of both the foreground and background to align with the provided text description. The unbounded nature in creativeness of a text allows us to describe the lighting of a scene with any sensory features including temperature, emotion, smell, time, and so on. However, the modeling of such mapping between the unbounded text and lighting is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset where there exists no scalable data that provides large pairs of text and relighting, and therefore, current text-driven image editing models does not generalize to lighting-specific use cases. We overcome this problem by introducing a novel data synthesis pipeline: First, diverse and creative text prompts that describe the scenes with various lighting are automatically generated under a crafted hierarchy using a large language model (*e.g.,* ChatGPT). A text-guided image generation model creates a lighting image that best matches the text. As a condition of the lighting images, we perform image-based relighting for both foreground and background using a single portrait image or a set of OLAT (One-Light-at-A-Time) images captured from lightstage system. Particularly for the background relighting, we represent the lighting image as a set of point lights and transfer them to other background images. A generative diffusion model learns the synthesized large-scale data with auxiliary task augmentation (*e.g.,* portrait delighting and light positioning) to correlate the latent text and lighting distribution for text-guided portrait relighting.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate reconstructions remains challenging, particularly in highly accelerated and undersampled acquisitions, which are crucial for reducing scan times. While deep learning techniques have advanced image reconstruction, the recent introduction of diffusion models offers new possibilities for imaging tasks, though their application in the medical field is still emerging. Notably, diffusion models have not yet been explored for the MRF problem. In this work, we propose for the first time a conditional diffusion probabilistic model for MRF image reconstruction. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons on in-vivo brain scan data demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform established deep learning and compressed sensing algorithms for MRF reconstruction. Extensive ablation studies also explore strategies to improve computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

However, existing methods predominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with real images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS image object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs, termed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels from global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local view, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map (ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with iso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground instances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion models. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a spatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and reliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby reducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose a structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of synthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM together.

Recent methods propose a finetuning-free approach with a decoupled cross-attention mechanism to generate personalized images requiring no test-time finetuning. However, when multiple reference images are provided, the current decoupled cross-attention mechanism encounters the object confusion problem and fails to map each reference image to its corresponding object, thereby seriously limiting its scope of application. To address the object confusion problem, in this work we investigate the relevance of different positions of the latent image features to the target object in diffusion model, and accordingly propose a weighted-merge method to merge multiple reference image features into the corresponding objects. Next, we integrate this weighted-merge method into existing pre-trained models and continue to train the model on a multi-object dataset constructed from the open-sourced SA-1B dataset. To mitigate object confusion and reduce training costs, we propose an object quality score to estimate the image quality for the selection of high-quality training samples. Furthermore, our weighted-merge training framework can be employed on single-object generation when a single object has multiple reference images. The experiments verify that our method achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-arts on the Concept101 dataset and DreamBooth dataset of multi-object personalized image generation, and remarkably improves the performance on single-object personalized image generation.

Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

Previous works on generative grasp synthesis fell short of precisely capturing the complex grasp distribution and reasoning about shape uncertainty in the unstructured and often partially perceived reality. In this work, we introduce a novel model that can generate diverse grasps for a multi-fingered hand while introspectively handling perceptual uncertainty and recognizing unknown object geometry to avoid performance degradation. Specifically, we devise a Deep Latent Variable Model (DLVM) based on Normalizing Flows (NFs), facilitating hierarchical and expressive latent representation for modeling versatile grasps. Our model design counteracts typical pitfalls of its popular alternative in generative grasping, i.e., conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs) whose performance is limited by mode collapse and miss-specified prior issues. Moreover, the resultant feature hierarchy and the exact flow likelihood computation endow our model with shape-aware introspective capabilities, enabling it to quantify the shape uncertainty of partial point clouds and detect objects of novel geometry. We further achieve performance gain by fusing this information with a discriminative grasp evaluator, facilitating a novel hybrid way for grasp evaluation. Comprehensive simulated and real-world experiments show that the proposed idea gains superior performance and higher run-time efficiency against strong baselines, including diffusion models. We also demonstrate substantial benefits of greater diversity for grasping objects in clutter and a confined workspace in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing.

To enable efficient and reliable simulation of extreme weather events, it is crucial to achieve rapid turnaround, dynamical consistency, and accurate spatio-temporal spectral recovery. We propose an efficient correction diffusion model, TAUDiff, that combines a deterministic spatio-temporal model for mean field downscaling with a smaller generative diffusion model for recovering the fine-scale stochastic features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on downscaling atmospheric wind velocity fields obtained from coarse GCM simulations. Our approach can not only ensure quicker simulation of extreme events but also reduce overall carbon footprint due to low inference times.</p></details> |  |

Recently, this success has been extended to 3D AIGC, with state-of-the-art methods generating textured 3D models from single images or text. However, we argue that current 3D AIGC methods still do not fully unleash human creativity. We often imagine 3D content made from multimodal inputs, such as what it would look like if my pet bunny were eating a doughnut on the table. In this paper, we explore a novel 3D AIGC approach: generating 3D content from IDEAs. An IDEA is a multimodal input composed of text, image, and 3D models. To our knowledge, this challenging and exciting 3D AIGC setting has not been studied before. We propose the new framework Idea23D, which combines three agents based on large multimodal models (LMMs) and existing algorithmic tools. These three LMM-based agents are tasked with prompt generation, model selection, and feedback reflection. They collaborate and critique each other in a fully automated loop, without human intervention. The framework then generates a text prompt to create 3D models that align closely with the input IDEAs. We demonstrate impressive 3D AIGC results that surpass previous methods. To comprehensively assess the 3D AIGC capabilities of Idea23D, we introduce the Eval3DAIGC-198 dataset, containing 198 multimodal inputs for 3D generation tasks. This dataset evaluates the alignment between generated 3D content and input IDEAs. Our user study and quantitative results show that Idea23D significantly improves the success rate and accuracy of 3D generation, with excellent compatibility across various LMM, Text-to-Image, and Image-to-3D models.

Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the $\texttt{e-COP}$ algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models.</p></details> |  |

Most existing work on DFL focuses on supervised learning, assuming each client possesses sufficient labeled data for local training. However, in real-world applications, much of the data is unlabeled. We address this by considering a challenging yet practical semisupervised learning (SSL) scenario in DFL, where clients may have varying data sources: some with few labeled samples, some with purely unlabeled data, and others with both. In this work, we propose SemiDFL, the first semi-supervised DFL method that enhances DFL performance in SSL scenarios by establishing a consensus in both data and model spaces. Specifically, we utilize neighborhood information to improve the quality of pseudo-labeling, which is crucial for effectively leveraging unlabeled data. We then design a consensusbased diffusion model to generate synthesized data, which is used in combination with pseudo-labeled data to create mixed datasets. Additionally, we develop an adaptive aggregation method that leverages the model accuracy of synthesized data to further enhance SemiDFL performance. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the remarkable performance superiority of the proposed DFL-Semi method over existing CFL and DFL schemes in both IID and non-IID SSL scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attentive Eraser: Unleashing Diffusion Model's Object Removal Potential via Self-Attention Redirection Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12974v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have emerged as promising newcomers in the field of generative models, shining brightly in image generation. However, when employed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as generating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object areas with appropriate content after removal. To tackle these problems, we propose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion models for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

| **[Urban Air Temperature Prediction using Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13504v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urbanization as a global trend has led to many environmental challenges, including the urban heat island (UHI) effect. The increase in temperature has a significant impact on the well-being of urban residents. Air temperature ($T_a$) at 2m above the surface is a key indicator of the UHI effect. How land use land cover (LULC) affects $T_a$ is a critical research question which requires high-resolution (HR) $T_a$ data at neighborhood scale. However, weather stations providing $T_a$ measurements are sparsely distributed e.g. more than 10km apart; and numerical models are impractically slow and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel method to predict HR $T_a$ at 100m ground separation distance (gsd) using land surface temperature (LST) and other LULC related features which can be easily obtained from satellite imagery. Our method leverages diffusion models for the first time to generate accurate and visually realistic HR $T_a$ maps, which outperforms prior methods. We pave the way for meteorological research using computer vision techniques by providing a dataset of an extended spatial and temporal coverage, and a high spatial resolution as a benchmark for future research. Furthermore, we show that our model can be applied to urban planning by simulating the impact of different urban designs on $T_a$.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods assume a uniform label distribution, resulting in suboptimal performance on real-world, imbalanced datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation approach using generative models to enhance data from the embedding space. Our method leverages the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture to capture all relation-wise distributions formed by entity pair representations and augment data for underrepresented relations. To better capture the multi-label nature of DocRE, we parameterize the VAE's latent space with a Diffusion Model. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical training framework to integrate the proposed VAE-based augmentation module into DocRE systems. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, effectively addressing the long-tail distribution problem in DocRE.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |
| **[Advances in Kidney Biopsy Lesion Assessment through Dense Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17166v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal biopsies are the gold standard for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. Lesion scores made by renal pathologists are semi-quantitative and exhibit high inter-observer variability. Automating lesion classification within segmented anatomical structures can provide decision support in quantification analysis, thereby reducing inter-observer variability. Nevertheless, classifying lesions in regions-of-interest (ROIs) is clinically challenging due to (a) a large amount of densely packed anatomical objects, (b) class imbalance across different compartments (at least 3), (c) significant variation in size and shape of anatomical objects and (d) the presence of multi-label lesions per anatomical structure. Existing models cannot address these complexities in an efficient and generic manner. This paper presents an analysis for a \textbf{generalized solution} to datasets from various sources (pathology departments) with different types of lesions. Our approach utilizes two sub-networks: dense instance segmentation and lesion classification. We introduce \textbf{DiffRegFormer}, an end-to-end dense instance segmentation sub-network designed for multi-class, multi-scale objects within ROIs. Combining diffusion models, transformers, and RCNNs, DiffRegFormer {is a computational-friendly framework that can efficiently recognize over 500 objects across three anatomical classes, i.e., glomeruli, tubuli, and arteries, within ROIs.} In a dataset of 303 ROIs from 148 Jones' silver-stained renal Whole Slide Images (WSIs), our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving an Average Precision of 52.1\% (detection) and 46.8\% (segmentation). Moreover, our lesion classification sub-network achieves 89.2\% precision and 64.6\% recall on 21889 object patches out of the 303 ROIs. Lastly, our model demonstrates direct domain transfer to PAS-stained renal WSIs without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are far from real-time, often requiring many sampling steps that take minutes to generate even one second of video-significantly limiting practical use. We introduce OSA-LCM (One-Step Avatar Latent Consistency Model), paving the way for real-time diffusion-based avatars. Our method achieves comparable video quality to existing methods but requires only one sampling step, making it more than 10x faster. To accomplish this, we propose a novel avatar discriminator design that guides lip-audio consistency and motion expressiveness to enhance video quality in limited sampling steps. Additionally, we employ a second-stage training architecture using an editing fine-tuned method (EFT), transforming video generation into an editing task during training to effectively address the temporal gap challenge in single-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that OSA-LCM outperforms existing open-source portrait video generation models while operating more efficiently with a single sampling step.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG). We propose three key components for the benchmark: dataset, baseline, and metrics. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, derived from an audio-visual dataset consisting of multichannel audio, video, and spatiotemporal annotations of sound events. We propose a baseline audio-visual diffusion model focused on stereo audio-visual joint learning to accommodate spatial sound. Finally, we present metrics to evaluate video and spatial audio quality, including a new spatial audio-visual alignment metric. Our experimental result demonstrates that gaps exist between the baseline model and ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, and spatial alignment between both modalities.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Existing global image editing models rely on additional masks or images as guidance to achieve layout control, often requiring retraining of the model. While local object-editing models allow modifications to object shapes, they lack the capability to control object positions. To address these limitations, we propose the Mask-free Training-free Object-Level Layout Control Diffusion Model (MFTF), which provides precise control over object positions without requiring additional masks or images. The MFTF model supports both single-object and multi-object positional adjustments, such as translation and rotation, while enabling simultaneous layout control and object semantic editing. The MFTF model employs a parallel denoising process for both the source and target diffusion models. During this process, attention masks are dynamically generated from the cross-attention layers of the source diffusion model and applied to queries from the self-attention layers to isolate objects. These queries, generated in the source diffusion model, are then adjusted according to the layout control parameters and re-injected into the self-attention layers of the target diffusion model. This approach ensures accurate and precise positional control of objects. Project source code available at https://github.com/syang-genai/MFTF.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we address low light image enhancement (LLIE), a task in which dark images often contain limited visible information. Diffusion models, known for their powerful image enhancement capacities, are a natural choice for this problem. However, their deep generative priors can also lead to hallucinations, introducing non-existent elements or substantially altering the visual semantics of the original scene. In this work, we introduce a novel zero-shot method for controlling and refining the generative behavior of diffusion models for dark-to-light image conversion tasks. Our method demonstrates superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in the task of low-light image enhancement, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task operate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to images outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are sparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent advances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an image-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our method, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for monocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time guidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative inference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot generalization across a diverse range of environments and handles even extremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary monocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to view the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by sparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.

We demonstrate TaKSIE, a novel framework that incorporates task progress knowledge into visual subgoal generation for robotic manipulation tasks. We jointly train a recurrent network with a latent diffusion model to generate the next visual subgoal based on the robot's current observation and the input language command. At execution time, the robot leverages a visual progress representation to monitor the task progress and adaptively samples the next visual subgoal from the model to guide the manipulation policy. We train and validate our model in simulated and real-world robotic tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN manipulation benchmark. We find that the inclusion of task progress knowledge can improve the robustness of trained policy for different initial robot poses or various movement speeds during demonstrations.

PMM uses conjugate pairs of distributions to model complex data of various modalities like images and text, offering a flexible alternative to existing methods like diffusion models. PMM models iteratively refine noisy approximations of the target distribution using updates from online Bayesian inference. PMM is flexible because its mechanics are based on general Bayesian models. We demonstrate this flexibility by developing specialized examples: a generative PMM model of real-valued data using the Normal-Normal model, a generative PMM model of count data using a Gamma-Poisson model, and a generative PMM model of discrete data using a Dirichlet-Categorical model. For the Normal-Normal PMM model, we establish a direct connection to diffusion models by showing that its continuous-time formulation converges to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Additionally, for the Gamma-Poisson PMM, we derive a novel SDE driven by a Cox process, which is a significant departure from traditional Brownian motion-based generative models. PMMs achieve performance that is competitive with generative models for language modeling and image generation.</p></details> |  |

We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of spatial-related data in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We address these issues with CoMPaSS, a versatile training framework that enhances spatial understanding of any T2I diffusion model. CoMPaSS solves the ambiguity of spatial-related data with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data through a set of principled spatial constraints. To better exploit the curated high-quality spatial priors, CoMPaSS further introduces a Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module to allow better exploitation of high-quality spatial priors, effectively compensating for the shortcoming of text encoders. Extensive experiments on four popular open-weight T2I diffusion models covering both UNet- and MMDiT-based architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMPaSS by setting new state-of-the-arts with substantial relative gains across well-known benchmarks on spatial relationships generation, including VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

| **[Causal Diffusion Transformers for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12095v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Causal Diffusion as the autoregressive (AR) counterpart of Diffusion models. It is a next-token(s) forecasting framework that is friendly to both discrete and continuous modalities and compatible with existing next-token prediction models like LLaMA and GPT. While recent works attempt to combine diffusion with AR models, we show that introducing sequential factorization to a diffusion model can substantially improve its performance and enables a smooth transition between AR and diffusion generation modes. Hence, we propose CausalFusion - a decoder-only transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, leading to state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark while also enjoying the AR advantage of generating an arbitrary number of tokens for in-context reasoning. We further demonstrate CausalFusion's multimodal capabilities through a joint image generation and captioning model, and showcase CausalFusion's ability for zero-shot in-context image manipulations. We hope that this work could provide the community with a fresh perspective on training multimodal models over discrete and continuous data.</p></details> | 22 figures, 21 pages |

Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand parameters that capture a device wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by our system can improve hand estimation: the resulting kinematic and temporal constraints can reduce world-frame errors in single-frame estimates by 40%.

| **[Prompt Augmentation for Self-supervised Text-guided Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13081v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing finds applications in various creative and practical fields. While recent studies in image generation have advanced the field, they often struggle with the dual challenges of coherent image transformation and context preservation. In response, our work introduces prompt augmentation, a method amplifying a single input prompt into several target prompts, strengthening textual context and enabling localised image editing. Specifically, we use the augmented prompts to delineate the intended manipulation area. We propose a Contrastive Loss tailored to driving effective image editing by displacing edited areas and drawing preserved regions closer. Acknowledging the continuous nature of image manipulations, we further refine our approach by incorporating the similarity concept, creating a Soft Contrastive Loss. The new losses are incorporated to the diffusion model, demonstrating improved or competitive image editing results on public datasets and generated images over state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized two-stage AI-based Neural Decoding for Enhanced Visual Stimulus Reconstruction from fMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13237v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based neural decoding reconstructs visual perception by leveraging generative models to map brain activity, measured through functional MRI (fMRI), into latent hierarchical representations. Traditionally, ridge linear models transform fMRI into a latent space, which is then decoded using latent diffusion models (LDM) via a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Due to the complexity and noisiness of fMRI data, newer approaches split the reconstruction into two sequential steps, the first one providing a rough visual approximation, the second on improving the stimulus prediction via LDM endowed by CLIP embeddings. This work proposes a non-linear deep network to improve fMRI latent space representation, optimizing the dimensionality alike. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset showed that the proposed architecture improved the structural similarity of the reconstructed image by about 2\% with respect to the state-of-the-art model, based on ridge linear transform. The reconstructed image's semantics improved by about 4\%, measured by perceptual similarity, with respect to the state-of-the-art. The noise sensitivity analysis of the LDM showed that the role of the first stage was fundamental to predict the stimulus featuring high structural similarity. Conversely, providing a large noise stimulus affected less the semantics of the predicted stimulus, while the structural similarity between the ground truth and predicted stimulus was very poor. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging non-linear relationships between BOLD signal and the latent representation and two-stage generative AI for optimizing the fidelity of reconstructed visual stimuli from noisy fMRI data.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods often yield suboptimal performance in generating high-quality 3D medical images, and there is currently no universal generative framework for medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce the 3D Medical Diffusion (3D MedDiffusion) model for controllable, high-quality 3D medical image generation. 3D MedDiffusion incorporates a novel, highly efficient Patch-Volume Autoencoder that compresses medical images into latent space through patch-wise encoding and recovers back into image space through volume-wise decoding. Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structure information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunEditor: Achieving Complex Image Edits via Function Aggregation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08495v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding performance in generative tasks, making them ideal candidates for image editing. Recent studies highlight their ability to apply desired edits effectively by following textual instructions, yet with two key challenges remaining. First, these models struggle to apply multiple edits simultaneously, resulting in computational inefficiencies due to their reliance on sequential processing. Second, relying on textual prompts to determine the editing region can lead to unintended alterations to the image. We introduce FunEditor, an efficient diffusion model designed to learn atomic editing functions and perform complex edits by aggregating simpler functions. This approach enables complex editing tasks, such as object movement, by aggregating multiple functions and applying them simultaneously to specific areas. Our experiments demonstrate that FunEditor significantly outperforms recent inference-time optimization methods and fine-tuned models, either quantitatively across various metrics or through visual comparisons or both, on complex tasks like object movement and object pasting. In the meantime, with only 4 steps of inference, FunEditor achieves 5-24x inference speedups over existing popular methods. The code is available at: mhmdsmdi.github.io/funeditor/.</p></details> |  |
| **[ArchesWeather & ArchesWeatherGen: a deterministic and generative model for efficient ML weather forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12971v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather forecasting plays a vital role in today's society, from agriculture and logistics to predicting the output of renewable energies, and preparing for extreme weather events. Deep learning weather forecasting models trained with the next state prediction objective on ERA5 have shown great success compared to numerical global circulation models. However, for a wide range of applications, being able to provide representative samples from the distribution of possible future weather states is critical. In this paper, we propose a methodology to leverage deterministic weather models in the design of probabilistic weather models, leading to improved performance and reduced computing costs. We first introduce \textbf{ArchesWeather}, a transformer-based deterministic model that improves upon Pangu-Weather by removing overrestrictive inductive priors. We then design a probabilistic weather model called \textbf{ArchesWeatherGen} based on flow matching, a modern variant of diffusion models, that is trained to project ArchesWeather's predictions to the distribution of ERA5 weather states. ArchesWeatherGen is a true stochastic emulator of ERA5 and surpasses IFS ENS and NeuralGCM on all WeatherBench headline variables (except for NeuralGCM's geopotential). Our work also aims to democratize the use of deterministic and generative machine learning models in weather forecasting research, with academic computing resources. All models are trained at 1.5{\deg} resolution, with a training budget of $\sim$9 V100 days for ArchesWeather and $\sim$45 V100 days for ArchesWeatherGen. For inference, ArchesWeatherGen generates 15-day weather trajectories at a rate of 1 minute per ensemble member on a A100 GPU card. To make our work fully reproducible, our code and models are open source, including the complete pipeline for data preparation, training, and evaluation, at https://github.com/INRIA/geoarches .</p></details> | Preprint |

Current methods for identifying semantics within latent space often rely on external supervision, such as textual information and segmentation masks. In this paper, we propose a method to identify semantic attributes in the latent space of pre-trained diffusion models without any further training. By projecting the Jacobian of the targeted semantic region into a low-dimensional subspace which is orthogonal to the non-masked regions, our approach facilitates precise semantic discovery and control over local masked areas, eliminating the need for annotations. We conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets and various architectures of diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, for some specific face attributes, the performance of our proposed method even surpasses that of supervised approaches, demonstrating its superior ability in editing local image properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVGDreamer: Text Guided SVG Generation with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16476v6)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVGs) synthesis has shown promise in domains such as iconography and sketch. However, existing text-to-SVG generation methods lack editability and struggle with visual quality and result diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a novel text-guided vector graphics synthesis method called SVGDreamer. SVGDreamer incorporates a semantic-driven image vectorization (SIVE) process that enables the decomposition of synthesis into foreground objects and background, thereby enhancing editability. Specifically, the SIVE process introduces attention-based primitive control and an attention-mask loss function for effective control and manipulation of individual elements. Additionally, we propose a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach to address issues of shape over-smoothing, color over-saturation, limited diversity, and slow convergence of the existing text-to-SVG generation methods by modeling SVGs as distributions of control points and colors. Furthermore, VPSD leverages a reward model to re-weight vector particles, which improves aesthetic appeal and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SVGDreamer, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity.

| **[Rethinking Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Synthesis on Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12778v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fundus imaging is a critical tool in ophthalmology, with different imaging modalities offering unique advantages. For instance, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) can accurately identify eye diseases. However, traditional invasive FFA involves the injection of sodium fluorescein, which can cause discomfort and risks. Generating corresponding FFA images from non-invasive fundus images holds significant practical value but also presents challenges. First, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models. Second, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single diseases or single modalities, often resulting in poor performance for patients with various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel latent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a fine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and unleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we designed a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different modalities and disease types. On limited datasets, our framework achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing methods, offering significant potential to enhance ophthalmic diagnostics and patient care. Our code will be released soon to support further research in this field.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Guided and Variance-Corrected Fusion with One-shot Style Alignment for Large-Content Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12771v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing large images using small diffusion models is gaining increasing popularity, as the cost of training large models could be prohibitive. A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit obvious artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. As a plug-and-play module, the proposed method can be widely applied to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Training Free Approach for 3D Scene Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12766v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text driven diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in editing images. However, when editing 3D scenes, existing works mostly rely on training a NeRF for 3D editing. Recent NeRF editing methods leverages edit operations by deploying 2D diffusion models and project these edits into 3D space. They require strong positional priors alongside text prompt to identify the edit location. These methods are operational on small 3D scenes and are more generalized to particular scene. They require training for each specific edit and cannot be exploited in real-time edits. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method, FreeEdit, to make edits in training free manner using mesh representations as a substitute for NeRF. Training-free methods are now a possibility because of the advances in foundation model's space. We leverage these models to bring a training-free alternative and introduce solutions for insertion, replacement and deletion. We consider insertion, replacement and deletion as basic blocks for performing intricate edits with certain combinations of these operations. Given a text prompt and a 3D scene, our model is capable of identifying what object should be inserted/replaced or deleted and location where edit should be performed. We also introduce a novel algorithm as part of FreeEdit to find the optimal location on grounding object for placement. We evaluate our model by comparing it with baseline models on a wide range of scenes using quantitative and qualitative metrics and showcase the merits of our method with respect to others.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSD-SR: One-Step Diffusion with Target Score Distillation for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18263v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly applied to real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) task. Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |
| **[No More Adam: Learning Rate Scaling at Initialization is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11768v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods for training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer's memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training settings.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[RDPI: A Refine Diffusion Probability Generation Method for Spatiotemporal Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12642v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal data imputation plays a crucial role in various fields such as traffic flow monitoring, air quality assessment, and climate prediction. However, spatiotemporal data collected by sensors often suffer from temporal incompleteness, and the sparse and uneven distribution of sensors leads to missing data in the spatial dimension. Among existing methods, autoregressive approaches are prone to error accumulation, while simple conditional diffusion models fail to adequately capture the spatiotemporal relationships between observed and missing data. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage Refined Diffusion Probability Impuation (RDPI) framework based on an initial network and a conditional diffusion model. In the initial stage, deterministic imputation methods are used to generate preliminary estimates of the missing data. In the refinement stage, residuals are treated as the diffusion target, and observed values are innovatively incorporated into the forward process. This results in a conditional diffusion model better suited for spatiotemporal data imputation, bridging the gap between the preliminary estimates and the true values. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that RDPI not only achieves state-of-the-art imputation accuracy but also significantly reduces sampling computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple and Efficient Baseline for Zero-Shot Generative Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12594v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large diffusion models have become mainstream generative models in both academic studies and industrial AIGC applications. Recently, a number of works further explored how to employ the power of large diffusion models as zero-shot classifiers. While recent zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers have made performance advancement on benchmark datasets, they still suffered badly from extremely slow classification speed (e.g., ~1000 seconds per classifying single image on ImageNet). The extremely slow classification speed strongly prohibits existing zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers from practical applications. In this paper, we propose an embarrassingly simple and efficient zero-shot Gaussian Diffusion Classifiers (GDC) via pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and DINOv2. The proposed GDC can not only significantly surpass previous zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers by over 10 points (61.40% - 71.44%) on ImageNet, but also accelerate more than 30000 times (1000 - 0.03 seconds) classifying a single image on ImageNet. Additionally, it provides probability interpretation of the results. Our extensive experiments further demonstrate that GDC can achieve highly competitive zero-shot classification performance over various datasets and can promisingly self-improve with stronger diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed GDC is the first zero-shot diffusionbased classifier that exhibits both competitive accuracy and practical efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[As Generative Models Improve, We Must Adapt Our Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333v4)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in generative AI has led to new models being introduced almost every month. In light of this rapid progression, we pose and address a central question: to what extent must prompts evolve as the capabilities of generative AI models advance? To answer this question, we conducted an online experiment with N = 1,983 participants where each participant was incentivized to write prompts to reproduce a target image as closely as possible in 10 consecutive tries. Each participant was randomly and blindly assigned to use one of three text-to-image diffusion models: DALL-E 2, its more advanced successor, DALL-E 3, or a version of DALL-E 3 with automatic prompt revision. In total, we collected and analyzed over 18,000 prompts and over 300,000 images. We find that task performance was higher for participants using DALL-E 3 than for those using DALL-E 2. This performance gap corresponds to a noticeable difference in the similarity of participants' images to their target images, and was caused in equal measure by: (1) the increased technical capabilities of DALL-E 3, and (2) endogenous changes in participants' prompting in response to these increased capabilities. Furthermore, while participants assigned to DALL-E 3 with prompt revision still outperformed those assigned to DALL-E 2, automatic prompt revision reduced the benefits of using DALL-E 3 by 58%. Our results suggest that for generative AI to realize its full impact on the global economy, people, firms, and institutions will need to update their prompts in response to new models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zigzag Diffusion Sampling: Diffusion Models Can Self-Improve via Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10891v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, the most popular generative paradigm so far, can inject conditional information into the generation path to guide the latent towards desired directions. However, existing text-to-image diffusion models often fail to maintain high image quality and high prompt-image alignment for those challenging prompts. To mitigate this issue and enhance existing pretrained diffusion models, we mainly made three contributions in this paper. First, we propose diffusion self-reflection that alternately performs denoising and inversion and demonstrate that such diffusion self-reflection can leverage the guidance gap between denoising and inversion to capture prompt-related semantic information with theoretical and empirical evidence. Second, motivated by theoretical analysis, we derive Zigzag Diffusion Sampling (Z-Sampling), a novel self-reflection-based diffusion sampling method that leverages the guidance gap between denosing and inversion to accumulate semantic information step by step along the sampling path, leading to improved sampling results. Moreover, as a plug-and-play method, Z-Sampling can be generally applied to various diffusion models (e.g., accelerated ones and Transformer-based ones) with very limited coding and computational costs. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that Z-Sampling can generally and significantly enhance generation quality across various benchmark datasets, diffusion models, and performance evaluation metrics. For example, DreamShaper with Z-Sampling can self-improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 94% over the original results. Moreover, Z-Sampling can further enhance existing diffusion models combined with other orthogonal methods, including Diffusion-DPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAD: Region-Aware Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09191v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

We consider the task of predicting a molecule's all-atom 3D structure given only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to measure these moments. While existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy. To address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{St}(n, 4)$. We then propose Stiefel Flow Matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints. Additionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for equivariant optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold. Empirically, enforcing exact moment constraints allows Stiefel Flow Matching to achieve higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

Nevertheless, achieving precise control over multi-track generation remains an open challenge. While existing models excel in directly generating multi-track mix, their limitations become evident when it comes to composing individual tracks and integrating them in a controllable manner. This departure from the typical workflows of professional composers hinders the ability to refine details in specific tracks. To address this gap, we propose JEN-1 Composer, a unified framework designed to efficiently model marginal, conditional, and joint distributions over multi-track music using a single model. Building upon an audio latent diffusion model, JEN-1 Composer extends the versatility of multi-track music generation. We introduce a progressive curriculum training strategy, which gradually escalates the difficulty of training tasks while ensuring the model's generalization ability and facilitating smooth transitions between different scenarios. During inference, users can iteratively generate and select music tracks, thus incrementally composing entire musical pieces in accordance with the Human-AI co-composition workflow. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in controllable and high-fidelity multi-track music synthesis, marking a significant advancement in interactive AI-assisted music creation.

But editing pattern images is tricky: desired edits are often programmatic: structure-aware edits that alter the underlying program which generates the pattern. One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task. Extensive experiments on real-world, artist-sourced patterns reveals that our method faithfully performs the demonstrated edit while also generalizing to related pattern styles beyond its training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://bardofcodes.github.io/patterns/</p></details> |
| **[DeepSN: A Sheaf Neural Framework for Influence Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12416v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization is key topic in data mining, with broad applications in social network analysis and viral marketing. In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to machine learning techniques to address this problem. They have developed methods to learn the underlying diffusion processes in a data-driven manner, which enhances the generalizability of the solution, and have designed optimization objectives to identify the optimal seed set. Nonetheless, two fundamental gaps remain unsolved: (1) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used to learn diffusion models, but in their traditional form, they often fail to capture the complex dynamics of influence diffusion, (2) Designing optimization objectives is challenging due to combinatorial explosion when solving this problem. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, DeepSN. Our framework employs sheaf neural diffusion to learn diverse influence patterns in a data-driven, end-to-end manner, providing enhanced separability in capturing diffusion characteristics. We also propose an optimization technique that accounts for overlapping influence between vertices, which helps to reduce the search space and identify the optimal seed set effectively and efficiently. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, due to the naturally significant sequence length of audio, the efficiency of audio generation remains an essential issue to be addressed, especially for AR models that are incorporated in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we analyze the token length of audio tokenization and propose a novel \textbf{S}cale-level \textbf{A}udio \textbf{T}okenizer (SAT), with improved residual quantization. Based on SAT, a scale-level \textbf{A}coustic \textbf{A}uto\textbf{R}egressive (AAR) modeling framework is further proposed, which shifts the next-token AR prediction to next-scale AR prediction, significantly reducing the training cost and inference time. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we comprehensively analyze design choices and demonstrate the proposed AAR framework achieves a remarkable \textbf{35}$\times$ faster inference speed and +\textbf{1.33} Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) against baselines on the AudioSet benchmark.

However, existing methods are typically constrained to single-aspect concept generation or are easily disrupted by irrelevant concepts in multi-aspect concept scenarios, leading to concept confusion and hindering creative generation. To address this, we propose OmniPrism, a visual concept disentangling approach for creative image generation. Our method learns disentangled concept representations guided by natural language and trains a diffusion model to incorporate these concepts. We utilize the rich semantic space of a multimodal extractor to achieve concept disentanglement from given images and concept guidance. To disentangle concepts with different semantics, we construct a paired concept disentangled dataset (PCD-200K), where each pair shares the same concept such as content, style, and composition. We learn disentangled concept representations through our contrastive orthogonal disentangled (COD) training pipeline, which are then injected into additional diffusion cross-attention layers for generation. A set of block embeddings is designed to adapt each block's concept domain in the diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, concept-disentangled results with high fidelity to text prompts and desired concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://tale17.github.io/omni/</p></details> |

Depending on the application, avatar reconstruction involves different capture setups and constraints $-$ for example, visual effects studios use camera arrays to capture hundreds of reference images, while content creators may seek to animate a single portrait image downloaded from the internet. As such, there is a large and heterogeneous ecosystem of methods for avatar reconstruction. Techniques based on multi-view stereo or neural rendering achieve the highest quality results, but require hundreds of reference images. Recent generative models produce convincing avatars from a single reference image, but visual fidelity yet lags behind multi-view techniques. Here, we present CAP4D: an approach that uses a morphable multi-view diffusion model to reconstruct photoreal 4D (dynamic 3D) portrait avatars from any number of reference images (i.e., one to 100) and animate and render them in real time. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for single-, few-, and multi-image 4D portrait avatar reconstruction, and takes steps to bridge the gap in visual fidelity between single-image and multi-view reconstruction techniques.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |

Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland/</p></details> |

In this paper, we examine the relationship between LoRA weights and artistic styles, demonstrating that LoRA weights alone can serve as an effective descriptor of style, without the need for additional image generation or knowledge of the original training set. Our findings show that LoRA weights yield better performance in clustering of artistic styles compared to traditional pre-trained features, such as CLIP and DINO, with strong structural similarities between LoRA-based and conventional image-based embeddings observed both qualitatively and quantitatively. We identify various retrieval scenarios for the growing collection of customized models and show that our approach enables more accurate retrieval in real-world settings where knowledge of the training images is unavailable and additional generation is required. We conclude with a discussion on potential future applications, such as zero-shot LoRA fine-tuning and model attribution.</p></details> |  |

However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |

In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://emotivetalk.github.io/</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method for fast, controllable, and background-free shadow generation for 2D object images. We create a large synthetic dataset using a 3D rendering engine to train a diffusion model for controllable shadow generation, generating shadow maps for diverse light source parameters. Through extensive ablation studies, we find that rectified flow objective achieves high-quality results with just a single sampling step enabling real-time applications. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the model generalizes well to real-world images. To facilitate further research in evaluating quality and controllability in shadow generation, we release a new public benchmark containing a diverse set of object images and shadow maps in various settings.

| **[GSDiff: Synthesizing Vector Floorplans via Geometry-enhanced Structural Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16258v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating architectural floorplan design is vital for housing and interior design, offering a faster, cost-effective alternative to manual sketches by architects. However, existing methods, including rule-based and learning-based approaches, face challenges in design complexity and constrained generation with extensive post-processing, and tend to obvious geometric inconsistencies such as misalignment, overlap, and gaps. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework for vector floorplan design via structural graph generation, called GSDiff, focusing on wall junction generation and wall segment prediction to capture both geometric and semantic aspects of structural graphs. To improve the geometric rationality of generated structural graphs, we propose two innovative geometry enhancement methods. In wall junction generation, we propose a novel alignment loss function to improve geometric consistency. In wall segment prediction, we propose a random self-supervision method to enhance the model's perception of the overall geometric structure, thereby promoting the generation of reasonable geometric structures. Employing the diffusion model and the Transformer model, as well as the geometry enhancement strategies, our framework can generate wall junctions, wall segments and room polygons with structural and semantic information, resulting in structural graphs that accurately represent floorplans. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses existing techniques, enabling free generation and constrained generation, marking a shift towards structure generation in architectural design.

| **[Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16173v3)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies, and providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on the application of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL is less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' actions. This leads to difficulties in conducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss, which can be proved to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective in online RL under certain conditions. To fulfill these conditions, the Q-weight transformation functions are introduced for general scenarios. Additionally, to further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. We also develop an efficient behavior policy to enhance sample efficiency by reducing the variance of the diffusion policy during online interactions. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

Despite advancements in visual colorization using large-scale generative models like diffusion models, challenges with controllability and identity consistency persist, making current solutions unsuitable for industrial application.To address this, we propose ColorFlow, a three-stage diffusion-based framework tailored for image sequence colorization in industrial applications. Unlike existing methods that require per-ID finetuning or explicit ID embedding extraction, we propose a novel robust and generalizable Retrieval Augmented Colorization pipeline for colorizing images with relevant color references. Our pipeline also features a dual-branch design: one branch for color identity extraction and the other for colorization, leveraging the strengths of diffusion models. We utilize the self-attention mechanism in diffusion models for strong in-context learning and color identity matching. To evaluate our model, we introduce ColorFlow-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for reference-based colorization. Results show that ColorFlow outperforms existing models across multiple metrics, setting a new standard in sequential image colorization and potentially benefiting the art industry.

| **[InterDyn: Controllable Interactive Dynamics with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11785v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans and intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to simplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world environments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction of state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single future state which neglects the continuous motion and subsequent dynamics resulting from the interaction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that generates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control signal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is that large video foundation models can act as both neural renderers and implicit physics simulators by learning interactive dynamics from large-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an interactive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on the motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn generates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object interactions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations show that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state transitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative models as implicit physics engines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lipschitz Singularities in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11251v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored and exploited large-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing, resulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still suffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of objects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by proposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo) method. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with the edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional Diffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the edited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting in a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated video. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with less border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling (IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant regions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be harmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that ReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and achieves superior video editing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

To address this gap, we propose the Visually Grounded Text-Video Prompting (VG-TVP) method which is a novel LLM-empowered Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) framework. It generates cohesive text and video procedural plans given a specified high-level objective. The main challenges are achieving textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and accuracy in procedural plans. VG-TVP leverages the zero-shot reasoning capability of LLMs, the video-to-text generation ability of the video captioning models, and the text-to-video generation ability of diffusion models. VG-TVP improves the interaction between modalities by proposing a novel Fusion of Captioning (FoC) method and using Text-to-Video Bridge (T2V-B) and Video-to-Text Bridge (V2T-B). They allow LLMs to guide the generation of visually-grounded text plans and textual-grounded video plans. To address the scarcity of datasets suitable for MPP, we have curated a new dataset called Daily-Life Task Procedural Plans (Daily-PP). We conduct comprehensive experiments and benchmarks to evaluate human preferences (regarding textual and visual informativeness, temporal coherence, and plan accuracy). Our VG-TVP method outperforms unimodal baselines on the Daily-PP dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025 in Main Track, 19 pages, 24 figures</p></details> |

However, current methods that map observation space to canonical space often face challenges in capturing pose-dependent details and generalizing to novel poses. While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in 2D image generation, their potential for creating animatable 3D avatars from 2D inputs remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce 3D$^2$-Actor, a novel approach featuring a pose-conditioned 3D-aware human modeling pipeline that integrates iterative 2D denoising and 3D rectifying steps. The 2D denoiser, guided by pose cues, generates detailed multi-view images that provide the rich feature set necessary for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and pose rendering. Complementing this, our Gaussian-based 3D rectifier renders images with enhanced 3D consistency through a two-stage projection strategy and a novel local coordinate representation. Additionally, we propose an innovative sampling strategy to ensure smooth temporal continuity across frames in video synthesis. Our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional numerical solutions in handling ill-posed mappings, producing realistic and animatable 3D human avatars.

However, most research has primarily focused on object motion, with limited attention given to cinematic language in videos, which is crucial for cinematographers to convey emotion and narrative pacing. To address this limitation, we propose a threefold approach to enhance the ability of T2V models to generate controllable cinematic language. Specifically, we introduce a cinematic language dataset that encompasses shot framing, angle, and camera movement, enabling models to learn diverse cinematic styles. Building on this, to facilitate robust cinematic alignment evaluation, we present CameraCLIP, a model fine-tuned on the proposed dataset that excels in understanding complex cinematic language in generated videos and can further provide valuable guidance in the multi-shot composition process. Finally, we propose CLIPLoRA, a cost-guided dynamic LoRA composition method that facilitates smooth transitions and realistic blending of cinematic language by dynamically fusing multiple pre-trained cinematic LoRAs within a single video. Our experiments demonstrate that CameraCLIP outperforms existing models in assessing the alignment between cinematic language and video, achieving an R@1 score of 0.81. Additionally, CLIPLoRA improves the ability for multi-shot composition, potentially bridging the gap between automatically generated videos and those shot by professional cinematographers.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, the expensive computation cost prevents the application of diffusion models in resource-constrained scenarios. Quantization emerges as a practical solution that significantly saves storage and computation by reducing the bit-width of parameters. However, the existing quantization methods for diffusion models still cause severe degradation in performance, especially under extremely low bit-widths (2-4 bit). The primary decrease in performance comes from the significant discretization of activation values at low bit quantization. Too few activation candidates are unfriendly for outlier significant weight channel quantization, and the discretized features prevent stable learning over different time steps of the diffusion model. This paper presents MPQ-DM, a Mixed-Precision Quantization method for Diffusion Models. The proposed MPQ-DM mainly relies on two techniques:(1) To mitigate the quantization error caused by outlier severe weight channels, we propose an Outlier-Driven Mixed Quantization (OMQ) technique that uses $Kurtosis$ to quantify outlier salient channels and apply optimized intra-layer mixed-precision bit-width allocation to recover accuracy performance within target efficiency.(2) To robustly learn representations crossing time steps, we construct a Time-Smoothed Relation Distillation (TRD) scheme between the quantized diffusion model and its full-precision counterpart, transferring discrete and continuous latent to a unified relation space to reduce the representation inconsistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MPQ-DM achieves significant accuracy gains under extremely low bit-widths compared with SOTA quantization methods. MPQ-DM achieves a 58\% FID decrease under W2A4 setting compared with baseline, while all other methods even collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, current methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering multi-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed, its 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization, as pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering optimization. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{EditSplat}, a novel 3D editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion Guidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view consistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the diffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image diffusion model and the geometric properties of 3DGS. Additionally, our AGT leverages the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and optimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise, semantically rich local edits.

Text prompts struggle with accuracy, and image translation struggles with consistency and fine-grained control. We present LineArt, a framework that transfers complex appearance onto detailed design drawings, facilitating design and artistic creation. It generates high-fidelity appearance while preserving structural accuracy by simulating hierarchical visual cognition and integrating human artistic experience to guide the diffusion process. LineArt overcomes the limitations of current methods in terms of difficulty in fine-grained control and style degradation in design drawings. It requires no precise 3D modeling, physical property specs, or network training, making it more convenient for design tasks. LineArt consists of two stages: a multi-frequency lines fusion module to supplement the input design drawing with detailed structural information and a two-part painting process for Base Layer Shaping and Surface Layer Coloring. We also present a new design drawing dataset ProLines for evaluation. The experiments show that LineArt performs better in accuracy, realism, and material precision compared to SOTAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://meaoxixi.github.io/LineArt/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often fail to preserve the identity of the garment or rely on complex processes. To address these limitations, we propose an improved diffusion model for restoring authentic garments. Our approach employs two garment extractors to independently capture low-level features and high-level semantics from the person image. Leveraging a pretrained latent diffusion model, these features are integrated into the denoising process through garment fusion blocks, which combine self-attention and cross-attention layers to align the restored garment with the person image. Furthermore, a coarse-to-fine training strategy is introduced to enhance the fidelity and authenticity of the generated garments. Experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively preserves garment identity and generates high-quality restorations, even in challenging scenarios such as complex garments or those with occlusions.</p></details> |  |

Current works further leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting as 3D representation for improved visual quality and rendering efficiency. However, we observe that existing Gaussian reconstruction models often suffer from multi-view inconsistency and blurred textures. We attribute this to the compromise of multi-view information propagation in favor of adopting powerful yet computationally intensive architectures (e.g., Transformers). To address this issue, we introduce MVGamba, a general and lightweight Gaussian reconstruction model featuring a multi-view Gaussian reconstructor based on the RNN-like State Space Model (SSM). Our Gaussian reconstructor propagates causal context containing multi-view information for cross-view self-refinement while generating a long sequence of Gaussians for fine-detail modeling with linear complexity. With off-the-shelf multi-view diffusion models integrated, MVGamba unifies 3D generation tasks from a single image, sparse images, or text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVGamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in all 3D content generation scenarios with approximately only $0.1\times$ of the model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

| **[MOVIS: Enhancing Multi-Object Novel View Synthesis for Indoor Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11457v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repurposing pre-trained diffusion models has been proven to be effective for NVS. However, these methods are mostly limited to a single object; directly applying such methods to compositional multi-object scenarios yields inferior results, especially incorrect object placement and inconsistent shape and appearance under novel views. How to enhance and systematically evaluate the cross-view consistency of such models remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose MOVIS to enhance the structural awareness of the view-conditioned diffusion model for multi-object NVS in terms of model inputs, auxiliary tasks, and training strategy. First, we inject structure-aware features, including depth and object mask, into the denoising U-Net to enhance the model's comprehension of object instances and their spatial relationships. Second, we introduce an auxiliary task requiring the model to simultaneously predict novel view object masks, further improving the model's capability in differentiating and placing objects. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the diffusion sampling process and carefully devise a structure-guided timestep sampling scheduler during training, which balances the learning of global object placement and fine-grained detail recovery. To systematically evaluate the plausibility of synthesized images, we propose to assess cross-view consistency and novel view object placement alongside existing image-level NVS metrics. Extensive experiments on challenging synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities and produces consistent novel view synthesis, highlighting its potential to guide future 3D-aware multi-object NVS tasks.</p></details> |  |

Visual Tokenization, trained by self-supervised reconstructive learning, compresses visual data by codebook in patch-level with marginal information loss, but the visual tokens does not have semantic meaning. Open Vocabulary semantic segmentation benefits from the evolving Vision-Language models (VLMs) with strong image zero-shot capability, but transferring image-level to pixel-level understanding remains an imminent challenge. In this paper, we treat segmentation as tokenizing pixels and study a united perceptual and semantic token compression for all granular understanding and consequently facilitate open vocabulary semantic segmentation. Referring to the cognitive process of pretrained VLM where the low-level features are progressively composed to high-level semantics, we propose Feature Pyramid Tokenization (PAT) to cluster and represent multi-resolution feature by learnable codebooks and then decode them by joint learning pixel reconstruction and semantic segmentation. We design loosely coupled pixel and semantic learning branches. The pixel branch simulates bottom-up composition and top-down visualization of codebook tokens, while the semantic branch collectively fuse hierarchical codebooks as auxiliary segmentation guidance. Our experiments show that PAT enhances the semantic intuition of VLM feature pyramid, improves performance over the baseline segmentation model and achieves competitive performance on open vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmark. Our model is parameter-efficient for VLM integration and flexible for the independent tokenization. We hope to give inspiration not only on improving segmentation but also on semantic visual token utilization.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, their capacity to leverage internal knowledge about specific entities remains underexplored. This work investigates the disparity in model performance when answering factual questions about an entity described in text versus depicted in an image. Our results reveal a significant accuracy drop --averaging 19%-- when the entity is presented visually instead of textually. We hypothesize that this decline arises from limitations in how information flows from image tokens to query tokens. We use mechanistic interpretability tools to reveal that, although image tokens are preprocessed by the vision encoder, meaningful information flow from these tokens occurs only in the much deeper layers. Furthermore, critical image processing happens in the language model's middle layers, allowing few layers for consecutive reasoning, highlighting a potential inefficiency in how the model utilizes its layers for reasoning. These insights shed light on the internal mechanics of VLMs and offer pathways for enhancing their reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Generalist Robot Policies: What Matters in Building Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14058v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in multi-modal representation learning, comprehension, and reasoning. By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research. We open-source all details, including codes, models, datasets, and toolkits, along with detailed training and evaluation recipes at: robovlms.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: robovlms.github.io</p></details> |

Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.</p></details> |  |

This approach highlights the current limitations of VLMs in understanding intricate object descriptions, pushing these models beyond mere object recognition. To facilitate this exploration, we introduce a new challenge and release description data for six popular fine-grained benchmarks, which omit object names to encourage genuine zero-shot learning within the research community. Additionally, we propose a method to enhance CLIP's attribute detection capabilities through targeted training using ImageNet21k's diverse object categories, paired with rich attribute descriptions generated by large language models. Furthermore, we introduce a modified CLIP architecture that leverages multiple resolutions to improve the detection of fine-grained part attributes. Through these efforts, we broaden the understanding of part-attribute recognition in CLIP, improving its performance in fine-grained classification tasks across six popular benchmarks, as well as in the PACO dataset, a widely used benchmark for object-attribute recognition.

In this paper, we extend the classic hand trajectory prediction task to two tasks involving explicit or implicit language queries. Our proposed tasks require extensive understanding of human daily activities and reasoning abilities about what should be happening next given cues from the current scene. We also develop new benchmarks to evaluate the proposed two tasks, Vanilla Hand Prediction (VHP) and Reasoning-Based Hand Prediction (RBHP). We enable solving these tasks by integrating high-level world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with the auto-regressive nature of low-level ego-centric hand trajectories. Our model, HandsOnVLM is a novel VLM that can generate textual responses and produce future hand trajectories through natural-language conversations. Our experiments show that HandsOnVLM outperforms existing task-specific methods and other VLM baselines on proposed tasks, and demonstrates its ability to effectively utilize world knowledge for reasoning about low-level human hand trajectories based on the provided context.

Despite their progress, challenges remain in both prompt-following ability, image quality and lack of high-quality datasets, which are essential for refining these models. As acquiring labeled data is costly, we introduce AGFSync, a framework that enhances T2I diffusion models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in a fully AI-driven approach. AGFSync utilizes Vision-Language Models (VLM) to assess image quality across style, coherence, and aesthetics, generating feedback data within an AI-driven loop. By applying AGFSync to leading T2I models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, and SDXL-base, our extensive experiments on the TIFA dataset demonstrate notable improvements in VQA scores, aesthetic evaluations, and performance on the HPSv2 benchmark, consistently outperforming the base models. AGFSync's method of refining T2I diffusion models paves the way for scalable alignment techniques.

| **[Nullu: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via HalluSpace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13817v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large vision-language models (LVLMs) often suffer from the issue of object hallucinations (OH). To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient method that edits the model weights based on an unsafe subspace, which we call HalluSpace in this paper. With truthful and hallucinated text prompts accompanying the visual content as inputs, the HalluSpace can be identified by extracting the hallucinated embedding features and removing the truthful representations in LVLMs. By orthogonalizing the model weights, input features will be projected into the Null space of the HalluSpace to reduce OH, based on which we name our method Nullu. We reveal that HalluSpaces generally contain statistical bias and unimodal priors of the large language models (LLMs) applied to build LVLMs, which have been shown as essential causes of OH in previous studies. Therefore, null space projection suppresses the LLMs' priors to filter out the hallucinated features, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Experiments show that our method can effectively mitigate OH across different LVLM families without extra inference costs and also show strong performance in general LVLM benchmarks. Code is released at \url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/Nullu}.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[RelationField: Relate Anything in Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13652v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural radiance fields are an emerging 3D scene representation and recently even been extended to learn features for scene understanding by distilling open-vocabulary features from vision-language models. However, current method primarily focus on object-centric representations, supporting object segmentation or detection, while understanding semantic relationships between objects remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose RelationField, the first method to extract inter-object relationships directly from neural radiance fields. RelationField represents relationships between objects as pairs of rays within a neural radiance field, effectively extending its formulation to include implicit relationship queries. To teach RelationField complex, open-vocabulary relationships, relationship knowledge is distilled from multi-modal LLMs. To evaluate RelationField, we solve open-vocabulary 3D scene graph generation tasks and relationship-guided instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both tasks.

| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.

| **[ZipVL: Efficient Large Vision-Language Models with Dynamic Token Sparsification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08584v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs) is constrained by the computational bottleneck of the attention mechanism during the prefill phase and the memory bottleneck of fetching the key-value (KV) cache in the decoding phase, particularly in scenarios involving high-resolution images or videos. Visual content often exhibits substantial redundancy, resulting in highly sparse attention maps within LVLMs. This sparsity can be leveraged to accelerate attention computation or compress the KV cache through various approaches. However, most studies focus on addressing only one of these bottlenecks and do not adequately support dynamic adjustment of sparsity concerning distinct layers or tasks. In this paper, we present ZipVL, an efficient inference framework designed for LVLMs through a dynamic ratio allocation strategy of important tokens. This ratio is adaptively determined based on the layer-specific distribution of attention scores, rather than fixed hyper-parameters, thereby improving efficiency for less complex tasks while maintaining high performance for more challenging ones. Then we select important tokens based on their normalized attention scores and perform sparse attention mechanism solely on those important tokens, reducing the latency in the prefill phase. Tokens deemed less important will be discarded to reduce KV cache size, alleviating the memory bottleneck in the decoding phase. Our experiments demonstrate that ZipVL can accelerate the prefill phase by 2.3$\times$ and improve decoding throughput by 2.8$\times$, with a minimal accuracy reduction of only 0.5\% on VQAv2 benchmark over LLaVA-Next-13B model, effectively enhancing the generation efficiency of LVLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13558v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through 3 self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' zero-shot performance on fundamental graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing the robustness of LVLMs against complex visual graphs.</p></details> |  |

During the CL of VLMs, we need not only to prevent the catastrophic forgetting on incrementally learned knowledge but also to preserve the zero-shot ability of VLMs. However, existing methods require additional reference datasets to maintain such zero-shot ability and rely on domain-identity hints to classify images across different domains. In this study, we propose Regression-based Analytic Incremental Learning (RAIL), which utilizes a recursive ridge regression-based adapter to learn from a sequence of domains in a non-forgetting manner and decouple the cross-domain correlations by projecting features to a higher-dimensional space. Cooperating with a training-free fusion module, RAIL absolutely preserves the VLM's zero-shot ability on unseen domains without any reference data. Additionally, we introduce Cross-domain Task-Agnostic Incremental Learning (X-TAIL) setting. In this setting, a CL learner is required to incrementally learn from multiple domains and classify test images from both seen and unseen domains without any domain-identity hint. We theoretically prove RAIL's absolute memorization on incrementally learned domains. Experiment results affirm RAIL's state-of-the-art performance in both X-TAIL and existing Multi-domain Task-Incremental Learning settings.

Existing global image editing models rely on additional masks or images as guidance to achieve layout control, often requiring retraining of the model. While local object-editing models allow modifications to object shapes, they lack the capability to control object positions. To address these limitations, we propose the Mask-free Training-free Object-Level Layout Control Diffusion Model (MFTF), which provides precise control over object positions without requiring additional masks or images. The MFTF model supports both single-object and multi-object positional adjustments, such as translation and rotation, while enabling simultaneous layout control and object semantic editing. The MFTF model employs a parallel denoising process for both the source and target diffusion models. During this process, attention masks are dynamically generated from the cross-attention layers of the source diffusion model and applied to queries from the self-attention layers to isolate objects. These queries, generated in the source diffusion model, are then adjusted according to the layout control parameters and re-injected into the self-attention layers of the target diffusion model. This approach ensures accurate and precise positional control of objects. Project source code available at https://github.com/syang-genai/MFTF.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Does VLM Classification Benefit from LLM Description Semantics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11917v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately describing images with text is a foundation of explainable AI. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have recently addressed this by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, expressing semantic similarities between vision and language embeddings. VLM classification can be improved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics, as the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling effect, where multiple modified text prompts act as a noisy test-time augmentation for the original one. We propose an alternative evaluation scenario to decide if a performance boost of LLM-generated descriptions is caused by such a noise augmentation effect or rather by genuine description semantics. The proposed scenario avoids noisy test-time augmentation and ensures that genuine, distinctive descriptions cause the performance boost. Furthermore, we propose a training-free method for selecting discriminative descriptions that work independently of classname-ensembling effects. Our approach identifies descriptions that effectively differentiate classes within a local CLIP label neighborhood, improving classification accuracy across seven datasets. Additionally, we provide insights into the explainability of description-based image classification with VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25, Code: https://github.com/CompVis/DisCLIP</p></details> |

Researchers actively engage in further fine-tuning VLMs in safety-critical domains. In these domains, prediction rationality is crucial: the prediction should be correct and based on valid evidence. Yet, for VLMs, the impact of fine-tuning on prediction rationality is seldomly investigated. To study this problem, we proposed two new metrics called Prediction Trustworthiness and Inference Reliability. We conducted extensive experiments on various settings and observed some interesting phenomena. On the one hand, we found that the well-adopted fine-tuning methods led to more correct predictions based on invalid evidence. This potentially undermines the trustworthiness of correct predictions from fine-tuned VLMs. On the other hand, having identified valid evidence of target objects, fine-tuned VLMs were more likely to make correct predictions. Moreover, the findings are also consistent under distributional shifts and across various experimental settings.

An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from reoccurring. This work focuses on classification of traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</p></details> | <details><summary>Won t...</summary><p>Won the 'Best Paper Runner-up Award' at the 2024 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2024).

| **[FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13303v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling the input image resolution is essential for enhancing the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs), particularly in text-rich image understanding tasks. However, popular visual encoders such as ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency caused by stacked self-attention layers. At different operational resolutions, the vision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby lowering overall latency. Based on a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution, vision latency, token count, and LLM size, we introduce FastVLM, a model that achieves an optimized trade-off between latency, model size and accuracy. FastVLM incorporates FastViTHD, a novel hybrid vision encoder designed to output fewer tokens and significantly reduce encoding time for high-resolution images. Unlike previous methods, FastVLM achieves the optimal balance between visual token count and image resolution solely by scaling the input image, eliminating the need for additional token pruning and simplifying the model design. In the LLaVA-1.5 setup, FastVLM achieves 3.2$\times$ improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. Compared to LLaVa-OneVision at the highest resolution (1152$\times$1152), FastVLM achieves comparable performance on key benchmarks like SeedBench and MMMU, using the same 0.5B LLM, but with 85$\times$ faster TTFT and a vision encoder that is 3.4$\times$ smaller.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feather the Throttle: Revisiting Visual Token Pruning for Vision-Language Model Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13180v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models show that strong performance can be maintained across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model and find that its strong performance across many tasks is not due to an exceptional ability to compress visual information, but rather the benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Namely, we demonstrate a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, this issue is only reflected in performance for a small subset of tasks such as localization. For the other evaluated tasks, strong performance is maintained with the flawed pruning strategy. Noting the limited visual capabilities of the studied acceleration technique, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that (1) resolves the identified issue with early-layer pruning, (2) incorporates uniform sampling to ensure coverage across all image regions, and (3) applies pruning in two stages to allow the criteria to become more effective at a later layer while still achieving significant speedup through early-layer pruning. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER has more than $5\times$ performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://web.stanford.edu/~markendo/projects/feather.html</p></details> |

However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. Our framework employs the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, with the adversarial noise generator pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-400M dataset. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMT: A Novel Benchmark for Chain of Multi-modal Thought on Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12932v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated amazing success in multi-modal tasks, including advancements in Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning. Despite these successes, current benchmarks still follow a traditional paradigm with multi-modal input and text-modal output, which leads to significant drawbacks such as missing visual operations and vague expressions. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Chain of Multi-modal Thought (CoMT) benchmark to address these limitations. Different from the traditional MCoT benchmark, CoMT requires both multi-modal input and multi-modal reasoning output, aiming to mimic human-like reasoning that inherently integrates visual operation. Specifically, CoMT consists of four categories: (1) Visual Creation, (2) Visual Deletion, (3) Visual Update, and (4) Visual Selection to comprehensively explore complex visual operations and concise expression in real scenarios. We evaluate various LVLMs and strategies on CoMT, revealing some key insights into the capabilities and limitations of the current approaches. We hope that CoMT can inspire more research on introducing multi-modal generation into the reasoning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLama can use images to understand and analyze complex visual scenes. 3D objects and shapes are the basic building blocks of the world, recognizing them is a fundamental part of human perception. The goal of this work is to test whether LVLMs truly understand 3D shapes by testing the models ability to identify and match objects of the exact same 3D shapes but with different orientations and materials/textures. Test images were created using CGI with a huge number of highly diverse objects, materials, and scenes. The results of this test show that the ability of such models to match 3D shapes is significantly below humans but much higher than random guesses. Suggesting that the models have gained some abstract understanding of 3D shapes but still trail far beyond humans in this task. Mainly it seems that the models can easily identify the same object with a different orientation as well as matching identical 3D shapes of the same orientation but with different material textures. However, when both the object material and orientation are changed, all models perform poorly relative to humans.</p></details> |  |

However, their manual creation is often labor-intensive, error-prone, and lacks robust mechanisms for error detection and correction. While recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, their application in automating generation of engineering workflows remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel copilot for automating the generation of P&IDs from natural language descriptions. Leveraging a multi-step agentic workflow, our copilot provides a structured and iterative approach to diagram creation directly from Natural Language prompts. We demonstrate the feasibility of the generation process by evaluating the soundness and completeness of the workflow, and show improved results compared to vanilla zero-shot and few-shot generation approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI'25 Workshop on AI to Accelerate Science and Engineering (AI2ASE)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel task called zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation, aimed at identifying aerial objects that are absent from training data. Challenges arise when classifying aerial categories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides, the domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote sensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model when it is directly applied to remote sensing images. To address these challenges, we propose a $\textbf{Z}$ero-Sh$\textbf{o}$t $\textbf{R}$emote Sensing $\textbf{I}$nstance Segmentation framework, dubbed $\textbf{ZoRI}$. Our approach features a discrimination-enhanced classifier that uses refined textual embeddings to increase the awareness of class disparities. Instead of direct fine-tuning, we propose a knowledge-maintained adaptation strategy that decouples semantic-related information to preserve the pretrained vision-language alignment while adjusting features to capture remote sensing domain-specific visual cues. Additionally, we introduce a prior-injected prediction with cache bank of aerial visual prototypes to supplement the semantic richness of text embeddings and seamlessly integrate aerial representations, adapting to the remote sensing domain. We establish new experimental protocols and benchmarks, and extensive experiments convincingly demonstrate that ZoRI achieves the state-of-art performance on the zero-shot remote sensing instance segmentation task.

CLIP, a large-scale vision-language model, performs well in FSL on image-text embedding similarities, but it is susceptible to misclassification caused by noisy labels. How to enhance domain generalization of CLIP on noisy data within FSL tasks is a critical challenge. In this paper, we provide a novel view to mitigate the influence of noisy labels, CLIP-based Robust Few-shot learning (CRoF). CRoF is a general plug-in module for CLIP-based models. To avoid misclassification and confused label embedding, we design the few-shot task-oriented prompt generator to give more discriminative descriptions of each category. The proposed prompt achieves larger distances of inter-class textual embedding. Furthermore, rather than fully trusting zero-shot classification by CLIP, we fine-tune CLIP on noisy few-shot data in a new domain with a weighting strategy like label-smooth. The weights for multiple potentially correct labels consider the relationship between CLIP's prior knowledge and original label information to ensure reliability. Our multiple label loss function further supports robust training under this paradigm. Comprehensive experiments show that CRoF, as a plug-in, outperforms fine-tuned and vanilla CLIP models on different noise types and noise ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activating Distributed Visual Region within LLMs for Efficient and Effective Vision-Language Training and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12785v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically learn visual capacity through visual instruction tuning, involving updates to both a projector and their LLM backbones. Drawing inspiration from the concept of visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous \textit{visual region} within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the possibility of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. We use Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed experiments and LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B for validation across a range of visual and textual tasks. Our findings reveal that selectively updating 25\% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99\% of visual performance while maintaining or enhancing textual task results, and also effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss. This study offers an effective and efficient strategy for LVLM training and inference by activating a layer-wise visual region within LLMs, which is consistently effective across different models and parameter scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending LVLMs Against Vision Attacks through Partial-Perception Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12722v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have raised significant concerns regarding the vulnerability of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to maliciously injected or perturbed input images, which can mislead their responses. Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models.</p></details> |  |

However, an in-depth study on the relationship between knowledge proficiency, especially essential driving expertise, and closed-loop autonomous driving performance requires further exploration. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the depth and breadth of fundamental driving knowledge on closed-loop trajectory planning and introduce WiseAD, a specialized VLM tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving capable of driving reasoning, action justification, object recognition, risk analysis, driving suggestions, and trajectory planning across diverse scenarios. We employ joint training on driving knowledge and planning datasets, enabling the model to perform knowledge-aligned trajectory planning accordingly. Extensive experiments indicate that as the diversity of driving knowledge extends, critical accidents are notably reduced, contributing 11.9% and 12.4% improvements in the driving score and route completion on the Carla closed-loop evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, WiseAD also demonstrates remarkable performance in knowledge evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework with a new human-annotated dataset to pinpoint model strengths and weaknesses, advancing from single-skill tasks to multi-skill tasks, and ultimately to complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of multiple spatial and visual cues with logical reasoning. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source models reveal significant shortcomings, especially in the abilities to understand distance and proximity, to reason from both allocentric and egocentric viewpoints, and to perform complex reasoning in a physical context. This work underscores the need for more advanced approaches to spatial understanding and reasoning, paving the way for improvements in vision-language models and their alignment with human-like spatial capabilities.

| **[Jailbreak Large Vision-Language Models Through Multi-Modal Linkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00473v4)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the significant advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), concerns about their potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Previous studies have highlighted VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, existing methods struggle against state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o, due to the over-exposure of harmful content and lack of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML utilizes an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate over-exposure of malicious information. To align the model's output with malicious intent covertly, MML employs a technique called "evil alignment", framing the attack within a video game production scenario. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate MML's effectiveness. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 97.80% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

Existing approaches typically rely on human annotators, making the process labor-intensive and creating a cognitive burden in generating diverse questions. To address this, we propose a semi-automated framework for constructing cultural VLM benchmarks, specifically targeting multiple-choice QA. This framework combines human-VLM collaboration, where VLMs generate questions based on guidelines, a small set of annotated examples, and relevant knowledge, followed by a verification process by native speakers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework through the creation of K-Viscuit, a dataset focused on Korean culture. Our experiments on this dataset reveal that open-source models lag behind proprietary ones in understanding Korean culture, highlighting key areas for improvement. We also present a series of further analyses, including human evaluation, augmenting VLMs with external knowledge, and the evaluation beyond multiple-choice QA.

Our proposed method is inspired by recent successes in vision-language models (VLMs), and departs from traditional methods which rely on task-specific data representations and/or algorithms. Specifically, on the input side, we simply treat the 2D CAD drawing as a raster image, regardless of its original format, and encode the image with a standard ViT model. We show that such an encoding scheme achieves competitive performance against existing methods that operate on vector-graphics inputs, while imposing substantially fewer restrictions on the 2D drawings. On the output side, our method auto-regressively predicts a general-purpose language describing 3D parametric models in text form. Compared to other sequence modeling methods for CAD which use domain-specific sequence representations with fixed-size slots, our text-based representation is more flexible, and can be easily extended to arbitrary geometric entities and semantic or functional properties. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of cabinet models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in AAAI 2025.

However, it often suffers from error supervision from low-quality pseudo labels. Vision-Language Model (VLM) has great potential to enhance pseudo labels by introducing text prompt guided multimodal supervision information. It nevertheless faces the cross-modal problem: the obtained messages tend to correspond to multiple targets. To address aforementioned problems, we propose a Dual Semantic Similarity-Supervised VLM (DuSSS) for SSMIS. Specifically, 1) a Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) is designed to improve cross-modal semantic consistency by capturing intrinsic representations within each modality and semantic correlations across modalities. 2) To encourage the learning of multiple semantic correspondences, a Semantic Similarity-Supervision strategy (SSS) is proposed and injected into each contrastive learning process in DCL, supervising semantic similarity via the distribution-based uncertainty levels. Furthermore, a novel VLM-based SSMIS network is designed to compensate for the quality deficiencies of pseudo-labels. It utilizes the pretrained VLM to generate text prompt guided supervision information, refining the pseudo label for better consistency regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our DuSSS achieves outstanding performance with Dice of 82.52%, 74.61% and 78.03% on three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, BM-Seg and MoNuSeg).</p></details> |  |

One immensely popular line of work utilizes frozen unimodal models, by bridging vision representations to language using a trainable module called the QFormer. However, this method relies heavily on large-scale multimodal pretraining with huge computational overheads. To that end, we propose a more efficient framework for QFormer-based vision-language alignment. Our key idea relies on the observation that QFormer latents correspond more strongly to the frozen LLM's intermediate latent space. Consequently, instead of using QFormer latents as inputs to the LLM, we alter the framework by using the latents to directly condition the LLM latent space for image-to-text generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against existing baselines in improving the efficiency of vision-language pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Under Review</p></details> |

However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, Accepted at COLING25</p></details> |

However, existing approaches typically consider only the textual content within documents, overlooking the fact that documents can contain multiple modalities, including images and tables. Also, they often segment each long document into multiple discrete passages for embedding, which prevents them from capturing the overall document context and interactions between paragraphs. To address these two challenges, we propose a method that holistically embeds documents interleaved with multiple modalities by leveraging the capability of recent vision-language models that enable the processing and integration of text, images, and tables into a unified format and representation. Moreover, to mitigate the information loss from segmenting documents into passages, instead of representing and retrieving passages individually, we further merge the representations of segmented passages into one single document representation, while we additionally introduce a reranking strategy to decouple and identify the relevant passage within the document if necessary. Then, through extensive experiments on diverse IR scenarios considering both the textual and multimodal queries, we show that our approach substantially outperforms relevant baselines, thanks to the consideration of the multimodal information within documents.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, these model hubs lack advanced model management and identification mechanisms, resulting in users only searching for models through text matching, download sorting, etc., making it difficult to efficiently find the model that best meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel setting called Generative Model Identification (GMI), which aims to enable the user to identify the most appropriate generative model(s) for the user's requirements from a large number of candidate models efficiently. To our best knowledge, it has not been studied yet. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive solution consisting of three pivotal modules: a weighted Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) framework for capturing the generated image distribution and the relationship between images and prompts, a pre-trained vision-language model aimed at addressing dimensionality challenges, and an image interrogator designed to tackle cross-modality issues. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the proposal is both efficient and effective. For example, users only need to submit a single example image to describe their requirements, and the model platform can achieve an average top-4 identification accuracy of more than 80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Diffusion Models</p></details> |

Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prior...</summary><p>Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</p></details> |

Our goal is to advance the classification performance using the CLIP's image encoder, by proposing a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM) based regularization method. The proposed method uses an LMM to extract semantic descriptions for the images of the dataset. Then, it uses the CLIP's text encoder, frozen, in order to obtain the corresponding text embeddings and compute the mean semantic class descriptions. Subsequently, we adapt the CLIP's image encoder by adding a classification head, and we train it along with the image encoder output, apart from the main classification objective, with an additional auxiliary objective. The additional objective forces the embeddings at the image encoder's output to become similar to their corresponding LMM-generated mean semantic class descriptions. In this way, it produces embeddings with enhanced discrimination ability, leading to improved classification performance.

| **[RITUAL: Random Image Transformations as a Universal Anti-hallucination Lever in Large Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17821v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs, yet they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that misinterpret visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. We propose RITUAL, a simple decoding method that reduces hallucinations by leveraging randomly transformed images as complementary inputs during decoding, adjusting the output probability distribution without additional training or external models. Our key insight is that random transformations expose the model to diverse visual perspectives, enabling it to correct misinterpretations that lead to hallucinations. Specifically, when a model hallucinates based on the original image, the transformed images -- altered in aspects such as orientation, scale, or color -- provide alternative viewpoints that help recalibrate the model's predictions. By integrating the probability distributions from both the original and transformed images, RITUAL effectively reduces hallucinations. To further improve reliability and address potential instability from arbitrary transformations, we introduce RITUAL+, an extension that selects image transformations based on self-feedback from the LVLM. Instead of applying transformations randomly, RITUAL+ uses the LVLM to evaluate and choose transformations that are most beneficial for reducing hallucinations in a given context. This self-adaptive approach mitigates the potential negative impact of certain transformations on specific tasks, ensuring more consistent performance across different scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that RITUAL and RITUAL+ significantly reduce hallucinations across several object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://sangminwoo.github.io/RITUAL/</p></details> |

However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward~(RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

A considerable number of these deaths are caused by animal-vehicle collisions (AVCs), which not only endanger human lives but also present serious risks to animal populations. This paper presents an innovative self-training methodology aimed at detecting rare animals, such as the cassowary in Australia, whose survival is threatened by road accidents. The proposed method addresses critical real-world challenges, including acquiring and labelling sensor data for rare animal species in resource-limited environments. It achieves this by leveraging cloud and edge computing, and automatic data labelling to improve the detection performance of the field-deployed model iteratively. Our approach introduces Label-Augmentation Non-Maximum Suppression (LA-NMS), which incorporates a vision-language model (VLM) to enable automated data labelling. During a five-month deployment, we confirmed the method's robustness and effectiveness, resulting in improved object detection accuracy and increased prediction confidence.

| **[Skip Tuning: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models are Effective and Efficient Adapters Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11509v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning (PT) has long been recognized as an effective and efficient paradigm for transferring large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by learning a tiny set of context vectors. Nevertheless, in this work, we reveal that freezing the parameters of VLMs during learning the context vectors neither facilitates the transferability of pre-trained knowledge nor improves the memory and time efficiency significantly. Upon further investigation, we find that reducing both the length and width of the feature-gradient propagation flows of the full fine-tuning (FT) baseline is key to achieving effective and efficient knowledge transfer. Motivated by this, we propose Skip Tuning, a novel paradigm for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. Unlike existing PT or adapter-based methods, Skip Tuning applies Layer-wise Skipping (LSkip) and Class-wise Skipping (CSkip) upon the FT baseline without introducing extra context vectors or adapter modules. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our Skip Tuning over both PT and adapter-based methods.

| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models from Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18844v4)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning enhances large vision-language models (LVLMs) but increases their vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to their open design. Unlike prior studies in static settings, this paper explores backdoor attacks in LVLM instruction tuning across mismatched training and testing domains. We introduce a new evaluation dimension, backdoor domain generalization, to assess attack robustness under visual and text domain shifts. Our findings reveal two insights: (1) backdoor generalizability improves when distinctive trigger patterns are independent of specific data domains or model architectures, and (2) the competitive interaction between trigger patterns and clean semantic regions, where guiding the model to predict triggers enhances attack generalizability. Based on these insights, we propose a multimodal attribution backdoor attack (MABA) that injects domain-agnostic triggers into critical areas using attributional interpretation. Experiments with OpenFlamingo, Blip-2, and Otter show that MABA significantly boosts the attack success rate of generalization by 36.4%, achieving a 97% success rate at a 0.2% poisoning rate. This study reveals limitations in current evaluations and highlights how enhanced backdoor generalizability poses a security threat to LVLMs, even without test data access.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

To address the problem, we present a novel contrastive prompt ensemble (ConPE) framework which utilizes a pretrained vision-language model and a set of visual prompts, thus enabling efficient policy learning and adaptation upon a wide range of environmental and physical changes encountered by embodied agents. Specifically, we devise a guided-attention-based ensemble approach with multiple visual prompts on the vision-language model to construct robust state representations. Each prompt is contrastively learned in terms of an individual domain factor that significantly affects the agent's egocentric perception and observation. For a given task, the attention-based ensemble and policy are jointly learned so that the resulting state representations not only generalize to various domains but are also optimized for learning the task. Through experiments, we show that ConPE outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms for several embodied agent tasks including navigation in AI2THOR, manipulation in egocentric-Metaworld, and autonomous driving in CARLA, while also improving the sample efficiency of policy learning and adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

OmniVLM introduces a token compression mechanism that reduces visual token sequence length from 729 to 81 tokens, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving visual-semantic fidelity. Through a multi-stage training pipeline of pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and minimal-edit Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), OmniVLM matches the performance of larger models. On multiple benchmarks including ScienceQA, POPE, and MMMU, OmniVLM outperforms existing baselines like nanoLLAVA within a 968M-parameter footprint. Empirical results on the same laptop demonstrate 9.1x faster time-to-first-token (0.75s vs 6.82s) and 1.5x higher decoding speed (29.41 vs 19.20 tokens/s) compared to nanoLLAVA, enabling efficient deployment on edge devices. The model weights can be accessed on huggingface: \url{https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/OmniVLM-968M}, and the inference examples can be find in Appendix B.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskCLIP++: A Mask-Based CLIP Fine-tuning Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11464v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary image segmentation has been advanced through the synergy between mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating masks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In this paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken the alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This motivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which uses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask classification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image segmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a consistency alignment constraint during fine-tuning, which alleviates categorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning, combining with the mask generator in previous state-of-the-art mask-based open vocabulary segmentation methods, we achieve performance improvements of +1.7, +2.3, +2.1, +3.1, and +0.3 mIoU on the A-847, PC-459, A-150, PC-59, and PAS-20 datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Tags for Large Vision-Language Understanding in Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11396v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-aware reasoning in vision-language tasks poses significant challenges for current models, particularly in handling unseen objects, reducing hallucinations, and capturing fine-grained relationships in complex visual scenes. To address these limitations, we propose the Vision-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (VRAP) framework, a generative approach that enhances Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented object tags into their prompts. VRAP introduces a novel pipeline where structured tags, including objects, attributes, and relationships, are extracted using pretrained visual encoders and scene graph parsers. These tags are enriched with external knowledge and incorporated into the LLM's input, enabling detailed and accurate reasoning. We evaluate VRAP across multiple vision-language benchmarks, including VQAv2, GQA, VizWiz, and COCO, achieving state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained reasoning and multimodal understanding. Additionally, our ablation studies highlight the importance of retrieval-augmented tags and contrastive learning, while human evaluations confirm VRAP's ability to generate accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant responses. Notably, VRAP achieves a 40% reduction in inference latency by eliminating runtime retrieval. These results demonstrate that VRAP is a robust and efficient framework for advancing object-aware multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Contrastive Learning for Video Temporal Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11391v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal reasoning is a critical challenge in video-language understanding, as it requires models to align semantic concepts consistently across time. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) excel at static tasks, they struggle to capture dynamic interactions and temporal dependencies in video sequences. In this work, we propose Temporal Semantic Alignment via Dynamic Prompting (TSADP), a novel framework that enhances temporal reasoning capabilities through dynamic task-specific prompts and temporal contrastive learning. TSADP leverages a Dynamic Prompt Generator (DPG) to encode fine-grained temporal relationships and a Temporal Contrastive Loss (TCL) to align visual and textual embeddings across time. We evaluate our method on the VidSitu dataset, augmented with enriched temporal annotations, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in tasks such as Intra-Video Entity Association, Temporal Relationship Understanding, and Chronology Prediction. Human evaluations further confirm TSADP's ability to generate coherent and semantically accurate descriptions. Our analysis highlights the robustness, efficiency, and practical utility of TSADP, making it a step forward in the field of video-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failures to Find Transferable Image Jailbreaks Between Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15211v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image ``jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of ``highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshops: RBFM (Best Paper), Frontiers in AdvML (Oral), Red Teaming GenAI (Oral), SoLaR (Spotlight), SATA</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking VLMs' Reasoning About Persuasive Atypical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10719v3)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1 (e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Aypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Our findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive advertisement understanding. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Generation of Targeted and Transferable Adversarial Examples for Vision-Language Models Via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10335v4)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks, particularly \textbf{targeted} transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation to modify the score during the diffusion model's reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask method to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack a variety of commercial VLMs in a black-box environment, including GPT-4V.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning with Vision-Language Models for Incremental Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10573v2)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Recent studies attempt to utilize Vision-Language Pre-training Models (VLPMs) with various fusion strategies for addressing the task.However, these methods typically fail to simultaneously meet two key requirements of CIR: comprehensively extracting visual information and faithfully following the user intent. In this work, we propose CIR-LVLM, a novel framework that leverages the large vision-language model (LVLM) as the powerful user intent-aware encoder to better meet these requirements. Our motivation is to explore the advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of LVLM for accurately understanding and responding the user intent. Furthermore, we design a novel hybrid intent instruction module to provide explicit intent guidance at two levels: (1) The task prompt clarifies the task requirement and assists the model in discerning user intent at the task level. (2) The instance-specific soft prompt, which is adaptively selected from the learnable prompt pool, enables the model to better comprehend the user intent at the instance level compared to a universal prompt for all instances. CIR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three prominent benchmarks with acceptable inference efficiency. We believe this study provides fundamental insights into CIR-related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, we propose RAC3, a novel framework designed to improve VLMs' ability to handle corner cases effectively. The framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination by dynamically incorporating context-specific external knowledge. A cornerstone of RAC3 is its cross-modal alignment fine-tuning, which utilizes contrastive learning to embed image-text pairs into a unified semantic space, enabling robust retrieval of similar scenarios. We evaluate RAC3 through extensive experiments using a curated dataset of corner case scenarios, demonstrating its ability to enhance semantic alignment, improve hallucination mitigation, and achieve superior performance metrics, such as Cosine Similarity and ROUGE-L scores. For example, for the LLaVA-v1.6-34B VLM, the cosine similarity between the generated text and the reference text has increased by 5.22\%. The F1-score in ROUGE-L has increased by 39.91\%, the Precision has increased by 55.80\%, and the Recall has increased by 13.74\%. This work underscores the potential of retrieval-augmented VLMs to advance the robustness and safety of autonomous driving in complex environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Recently, vision language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated impressive transferability to downstream tasks in data limited or label limited settings. However, current CLIP-based methods suffer from semantic confusion in MLR task due to the lack of fine-grained information in the single global visual and textual representation for all categories. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a semantic decoupling module and a category-specific prompt optimization method in CLIP-based framework. Specifically, the semantic decoupling module following the visual encoder learns category-specific feature maps by utilizing the semantic-guided spatial attention mechanism. Moreover, the category-specific prompt optimization method is introduced to learn text representations aligned with category semantics. Therefore, the prediction of each category is independent, which alleviate the semantic confusion problem. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO 2014 and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-art methods with a simpler model structure. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our method effectively separates information from different categories and achieves better performance compared to CLIP-based baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications</p></details> |

However, EQA in real-world scenarios remains challenging, as human-posed questions often contain noise that can interfere with an agent's exploration and response, bringing challenges especially for language beginners and non-expert users. To address this, we introduce a NoisyEQA benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to recognize and correct noisy questions. This benchmark introduces four common types of noise found in real-world applications: Latent Hallucination Noise, Memory Noise, Perception Noise, and Semantic Noise generated through an automated dataset creation framework. Additionally, we also propose a 'Self-Correction' prompting mechanism and a new evaluation metric to enhance and measure both noise detection capability and answer quality. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that current EQA agents often struggle to detect noise in questions, leading to responses that frequently contain erroneous information. Through our Self-Correct Prompting mechanism, we can effectively improve the accuracy of agent answers.</p></details> |  |

While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown significant progress, they often struggle to capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in complex video sequences. To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework that integrates a Causal-Temporal Reasoning Module (CTRM) into state-of-the-art LVLMs. CTRM comprises two key components: the Causal Dynamics Encoder (CDE) and the Temporal Relational Learner (TRL), which collectively encode causal dependencies and temporal consistency from video frames. We further design a multi-stage learning strategy to optimize the model, combining pre-training on large-scale video-text datasets, fine-tuning on causally annotated data, and contrastive alignment for better embedding coherence. Experimental results on standard benchmarks such as MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both automatic metrics (CIDEr, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L) and human evaluations, achieving more fluent, coherent, and relevant captions. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in generating captions with enriched causal-temporal narratives.</p></details> |  |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods commonly employ prompt tuning with pre-trained vision-language models but are inherently limited by static prompts, reducing adaptability. We propose UCDR-Adapter, which enhances pre-trained models with adapters and dynamic prompt generation through a two-phase training strategy. First, Source Adapter Learning integrates class semantics with domain-specific visual knowledge using a Learnable Textual Semantic Template and optimizes Class and Domain Prompts via momentum updates and dual loss functions for robust alignment. Second, Target Prompt Generation creates dynamic prompts by attending to masked source prompts, enabling seamless adaptation to unseen domains and classes. Unlike prior approaches, UCDR-Adapter dynamically adapts to evolving data distributions, enhancing both flexibility and generalization. During inference, only the image branch and generated prompts are used, eliminating reliance on textual inputs for highly efficient retrieval. Extensive benchmark experiments show that UCDR-Adapter consistently outperforms ProS in most cases and other state-of-the-art methods on UCDR, U(c)CDR, and U(d)CDR settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025.

To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we leverage the ConserveBench from CogDevelop2K, a data-intensive cognitive experiment benchmark for assaying the developmental trajectory of machine intelligence. The battery includes over 350 questions across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve only transformational tasks, whereas the latter two also involve non-transformational tasks assessing the understanding of quantitative concepts alone. Surprisingly, we find that while VLMs are generally capable of conserving, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks which success is typically considered to be entailed by the ability to conserve. This implies that the law of conservation, at least in concrete domains, may exist without corresponding conceptual understanding of quantity. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$</p></details> | <details><summary>$\hre...</summary><p>$\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$</p></details> |
| **[VisionArena: 230K Real World User-VLM Conversations with Preference Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08687v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption and capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) comes the need for benchmarks that capture authentic user-VLM interactions. In response, we create VisionArena, a dataset of 230K real-world conversations between users and VLMs. Collected from Chatbot Arena - an open-source platform where users interact with VLMs and submit preference votes - VisionArena spans 73K unique users, 45 VLMs, and 138 languages. Our dataset contains three subsets: VisionArena-Chat, 200k single and multi-turn conversations between a user and a VLM; VisionArena-Battle, 30K conversations comparing two anonymous VLMs with user preference votes; and VisionArena-Bench, an automatic benchmark of 500 diverse user prompts that efficiently approximate the live Chatbot Arena model rankings. Additionally, we highlight the types of question asked by users, the influence of response style on preference, and areas where models often fail. We find open-ended tasks like captioning and humor are highly style-dependent, and current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning and planning tasks. Lastly, we show finetuning the same base model on VisionArena-Chat outperforms Llava-Instruct-158K, with a 17-point gain on MMMU and a 46-point gain on the WildVision benchmark.

| **[SOLO: A Single Transformer for Scalable Vision-Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06438v3)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling. Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[Towards Unified Benchmark and Models for Multi-Modal Perceptual Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10594v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception of similarity across uni- and multimodal inputs is highly complex, making it challenging to develop automated metrics that accurately mimic it. General purpose vision-language models, such as CLIP and large multi-modal models (LMMs), can be applied as zero-shot perceptual metrics, and several recent works have developed models specialized in narrow perceptual tasks. However, the extent to which existing perceptual metrics align with human perception remains unclear. To investigate this question, we introduce UniSim-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 7 multi-modal perceptual similarity tasks, with a total of 25 datasets. Our evaluation reveals that while general-purpose models perform reasonably well on average, they often lag behind specialized models on individual tasks. Conversely, metrics fine-tuned for specific tasks fail to generalize well to unseen, though related, tasks. As a first step towards a unified multi-task perceptual similarity metric, we fine-tune both encoder-based and generative vision-language models on a subset of the UniSim-Bench tasks. This approach yields the highest average performance, and in some cases, even surpasses taskspecific models. Nevertheless, these models still struggle with generalization to unseen tasks, highlighting the ongoing challenge of learning a robust, unified perceptual similarity metric capable of capturing the human notion of similarity. The code and models are available at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/UniSim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patchfinder: Leveraging Visual Language Models for Accurate Information Retrieval using Model Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02886v3)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For decades, corporations and governments have relied on scanned documents to record vast amounts of information. However, extracting this information is a slow and tedious process due to the sheer volume and complexity of these records. The rise of Vision Language Models (VLMs) presents a way to efficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The current automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the extraction of information using optical character recognition software and subsequent usage of large language models for processing this information. Unfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with noisy scanned documents, often requiring computationally expensive language models to handle high information density effectively. In this study, we propose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon VLMs to improve information extraction. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence, based on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the model's confidence in its predictions. Using this metric, PatchFinder determines a suitable patch size, partitions the input document into overlapping patches, and generates confidence-based predictions for the target information. Our experimental results show that PatchFinder, leveraging Phi-3v, a 4.2-billion-parameter VLM, achieves an accuracy of 94% on our dataset of 190 noisy scanned documents, outperforming ChatGPT-4o by 18.5 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025</p></details> |

While existing models can contextualize content, they often struggle to grasp the underlying intent within a reference image or scene, leading to misaligned edits. We introduce the Editing Vision-Language Model (EVLM), a system designed to interpret such instructions in conjunction with reference visuals, producing precise and context-aware editing prompts. Leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and KL-Divergence Target Optimization (KTO) alignment technique, EVLM captures subjective editing preferences without requiring binary labels. Fine-tuned on a dataset of 30,000 CoT examples, with rationale paths rated by human evaluators, EVLM demonstrates substantial improvements in alignment with human intentions. Experiments across image, video, 3D, and 4D editing tasks show that EVLM generates coherent, high-quality instructions, supporting a scalable framework for complex vision-language applications.</p></details> | Technical Report |

In particular, we assess this bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the emotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the study evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images -- traditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language models, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of image-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types. Results show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), significantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing emotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the differences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based emotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images. Findings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative emotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in generative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces, perpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with psychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs across digital media.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in the medical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible, large-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on closed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not generalize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited number of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to other modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale, open-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text pairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Pathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific classification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing image-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining. Using UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that significantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches modality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot evaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on proprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets, while using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release UniMed dataset, training codes, and models at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, models and demo available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP</p></details> |
| **[A dual contrastive framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10348v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current multimodal tasks, models typically freeze the encoder and decoder while adapting intermediate layers to task-specific goals, such as region captioning. Region-level visual understanding presents significant challenges for large-scale vision-language models. While limited spatial awareness is a known issue, coarse-grained pretraining, in particular, exacerbates the difficulty of optimizing latent representations for effective encoder-decoder alignment. We propose AlignCap, a framework designed to enhance region-level understanding through fine-grained alignment of latent spaces. Our approach introduces a novel latent feature refinement module that enhances conditioned latent space representations to improve region-level captioning performance. We also propose an innovative alignment strategy, the semantic space alignment module, which boosts the quality of multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive learning in a novel manner within both modules to further enhance region-level captioning performance. To address spatial limitations, we employ a General Object Detection (GOD) method as a data preprocessing pipeline that enhances spatial reasoning at the regional level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves region-level captioning performance across various tasks</p></details> |  |

For the vision component, we incorporate a dynamic tiling vision encoding strategy designed for processing high-resolution images with different aspect ratios. For the language component, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable efficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language dataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks, including but not limited to visual question answering, optical character recognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our model series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny, DeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated parameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing open-source dense and MoE-based models.

In this context, we constructed a dataset of 32,000 automatically generated instruction-following examples, which we denote as VLR-IF. This dataset is specifically designed to enhance the RAG capabilities of VLMs by enabling them to learn how to generate appropriate answers based on input passages. We evaluated the validity of the proposed benchmark and training data and verified its performance using the state-of-the-art Llama3-based VLM, the Llava-Llama-3 model.

A common approach currently involves dynamically cropping the original high-resolution image into smaller sub-images, which are then fed into a vision encoder that was pre-trained on lower-resolution images. However, this cropping approach often truncates objects and connected areas in the original image, causing semantic breaks. To address this limitation, we introduce HyViLM, designed to process images of any resolution while retaining the overall context during encoding. Specifically, we: (i) Design a new visual encoder called Hybrid Encoder that not only encodes individual sub-images but also interacts with detailed global visual features, significantly improving the model's ability to encode high-resolution images. (ii) Propose an optimal feature fusion strategy for the dynamic cropping approach, effectively leveraging information from different layers of the vision encoder. Compared with the state-of-the-art MLLMs under the same setting, our HyViLM outperforms existing MLLMs in nine out of ten tasks. Specifically, HyViLM achieves a 9.6% improvement in performance on the TextVQA task and a 6.9% enhancement on the DocVQA task.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional calorie estimation tools often rely on specific data formats or complex pipelines, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in understanding real-world contexts and enabling conversational interactions, making them ideal for downstream tasks such as ingredient analysis. However, applying VLMs to calorie estimation requires domain-specific data and alignment strategies. To this end, we curated CalData, a 330K image-text pair dataset tailored for ingredient recognition and calorie estimation, combining a large-scale recipe dataset with detailed nutritional instructions for robust vision-language training. Built upon this dataset, we present CaLoRAify, a novel VLM framework aligning ingredient recognition and calorie estimation via training with visual-text pairs. During inference, users only need a single monocular food image to estimate calories while retaining the flexibility of agent-based conversational interaction. With Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieve-augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, our system enhances the performance of foundational VLMs in the vertical domain of calorie estimation.

However, fine-tuning these models for domain-specific applications remains a computationally intensive challenge. This paper introduces State Space Memory Integration (SSMI), a novel approach for efficient fine-tuning of LVLMs. By integrating lightweight Mamba-based state space modules into the LVLM architecture, SSMI captures long-range dependencies and injects task-specific visual and sequential patterns effectively. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, SSMI requires only a fraction of the model's parameters to be updated, making it computationally efficient and scalable. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including COCO Captioning, VQA, and Flickr30k, demonstrate that SSMI achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining robustness and generalization capabilities. Comprehensive analysis further validates the advantages of SSMI in terms of efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability, positioning it as a compelling solution for fine-tuning large-scale vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretraining Vision-Language Model for Difference Visual Question Answering in Longitudinal Chest X-rays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08966v3)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair of images. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model's performance.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we first conduct an empirical analysis of the long-context capabilities of VLMs using our augmented long-context multimodal datasets. Our findings reveal that directly applying the positional encoding mechanism used for textual tokens to visual tokens is suboptimal, and VLM performance degrades sharply when the position encoding exceeds the model's context window. To address this, we propose Variable Visual Position Encoding (V2PE), a novel positional encoding approach that employs variable and smaller increments for visual tokens, enabling more efficient management of long multimodal sequences. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of V2PE to enhances VLMs' ability to effectively understand and reason over long multimodal contexts. We further integrate V2PE with our augmented long-context multimodal datasets to fine-tune the open-source VLM, InternVL2. The fine-tuned model achieves strong performance on both standard and long-context multimodal tasks. Notably, when the sequence length of the training dataset is increased to 256K tokens, the model is capable of processing multimodal sequences up to 1M tokens, highlighting its potential for real-world long-context applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and models will be available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/V2PE</p></details> |

Surprisingly, we find VLMs achieving high performance on intentionality understanding but lower performance on perspective-taking.

However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.

CLIP, one of the most popular VLMs, has exhibited remarkable zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities in classification. To transfer CLIP to downstream tasks, adapters constitute a parameter-efficient approach that avoids backpropagation through the large model (unlike related prompt learning methods). However, CLIP adapters have been developed to target discriminative performance, and the quality of their uncertainty estimates has been overlooked. In this work we show that the discriminative performance of state-of-the-art CLIP adapters does not always correlate with their uncertainty estimation capabilities, which are essential for a safe deployment in real-world scenarios. We also demonstrate that one of such adapters is obtained through MAP inference from a more general probabilistic framework. Based on this observation we introduce BayesAdapter, which leverages Bayesian inference to estimate a full probability distribution instead of a single point, better capturing the variability inherent in the parameter space. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach obtains high quality uncertainty estimates in the predictions, standing out in calibration and selective classification.

Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the considerable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different tasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos separately with different token compression strategies, limiting the capabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image into a "static" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called Progressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are progressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information not extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed with exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static videos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple frames. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited number of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal changes can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks, including long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our unified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image benchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks.</p></details> |  |

Yet concerns persist about their potential to amplify human-like biases, including skin tone bias. Skin tone bias, where darker-skinned individuals face more negative stereotyping than lighter-skinned individuals, is well-documented in the social sciences but remains under-explored in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in VLMs. While well-documented in the social sciences, this bias remains under-explored in AI, particularly in VLMs. Using the GAN Face Database, we sampled computer-generated images of Black American men and women, controlling for skin tone variations while keeping other features constant. We then asked VLMs to write stories about these faces and compared the homogeneity of the generated stories. Stories generated by VLMs about darker-skinned Black individuals were more homogeneous than those about lighter-skinned individuals in three of four models, and Black women were consistently represented more homogeneously than Black men across all models. Interaction effects revealed a greater impact of skin tone on women in two VLMs, while the other two showed nonsignificant results, reflecting known stereotyping patterns. These findings underscore the propagation of biases from single-modality AI systems to multimodal models and highlight the need for further research to address intersectional biases in AI.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional pure vision models face challenges of redundant feature extraction, whereas existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490,000 samples from diverse pathology tasks-including cancer detection, grading, vascular and neural invasion identification, and so on-we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, offering an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-embedded Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple universal attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. To finalize the attributes for downstream tasks, we propose a differentiable attribute search method that learns to identify representative and suitable attributes from a candidate pool summarized by a large language model. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing prompt format of textual-based methods, offering general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Model Developmental Safety: A Retention-Centric Method and Applications in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the good performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a retention-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model, specifically the CLIP model, for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09353v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</p></details> |  |

Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP models are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a worthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training foundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper focuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show that existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured triggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical vulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we introduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective mechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments across different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR achieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance. Finally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic text-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a skill-learning framework that enables robots to acquire novel skills from natural language instructions. The proposed pipeline leverages vision-language models to generate demonstration videos of novel skills, which are processed by an inverse dynamics model to extract actions from the unlabeled demonstrations. These actions are subsequently mapped to environmental contexts via imitation learning, enabling robots to learn new skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on novel tasks. These results highlight a novel approach to robot learning, offering a foundation for the intuitive and intelligent acquisition of novel robotic skills.</p></details> |  |

To address this, researchers have explored two independent approaches: adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and leveraging synthetic data. However, VLMs often struggle with granularity, failing to disentangle fine-grained concepts, while synthetic data-based methods remain limited by the scope of available datasets. This paper proposes enhancing segmentation accuracy across diverse domains by integrating Vision-Language reasoning with key strategies for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). First, we improve the fine-grained segmentation capabilities of VLMs through multi-scale contextual data, robust text embeddings with prompt augmentation, and layer-wise fine-tuning in our proposed Foundational-Retaining Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (FROVSS) framework. Next, we incorporate these enhancements into a UDA framework by employing distillation to stabilize training and cross-domain mixed sampling to boost adaptability without compromising generalization. The resulting UDA-FROVSS framework is the first UDA approach to effectively adapt across domains without requiring shared categories.</p></details> |  |

However, few studies have developed benchmarks specifically tailored for detailed captions to measure their accuracy and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we introduce a detailed caption benchmark, termed as CompreCap, to evaluate the visual context from a directed scene graph view. Concretely, we first manually segment the image into semantically meaningful regions (i.e., semantic segmentation mask) according to common-object vocabulary, while also distinguishing attributes of objects within all those regions. Then directional relation labels of these objects are annotated to compose a directed scene graph that can well encode rich compositional information of the image. Based on our directed scene graph, we develop a pipeline to assess the generated detailed captions from LVLMs on multiple levels, including the object-level coverage, the accuracy of attribute descriptions, the score of key relationships, etc. Experimental results on the CompreCap dataset confirm that our evaluation method aligns closely with human evaluation scores across LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures.

This is primarily due to the fact that they do not scale to utilizing a large number of frames. In order to address this limitation, we propose Espresso, a novel method that extracts and compresses spatial and temporal information separately. Through extensive evaluations, we show that spatial and temporal compression in Espresso each have a positive impact on the long-form video understanding capabilities; when combined, their positive impact increases. Furthermore, we show that Espresso's performance scales well with more training data, and that Espresso is far more effective than the existing projectors for VLMs in long-form video understanding. Moreover, we devise a more difficult evaluation setting for EgoSchema called "needle-in-a-haystack" that multiplies the lengths of the input videos. Espresso achieves SOTA performance on this task, outperforming the SOTA VLMs that have been trained on much more training data.</p></details> | 11 pages |

But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages.

However, existing methods have two main challenges in fine-tuning multimodal models. Firstly, they are designed for vision-language tasks and fail to extend to situations where there are more than two modalities. Secondly, they exhibit limited exploitation of interactions between modalities and lack efficiency. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose the loW-rank sequence multimodal adapter (Wander). We first use the outer product to fuse the information from different modalities in an element-wise way effectively. For efficiency, we use CP decomposition to factorize tensors into rank-one components and achieve substantial parameter reduction. Furthermore, we implement a token-level low-rank decomposition to extract more fine-grained features and sequence relationships between modalities. With these designs, Wander enables token-level interactions between sequences of different modalities in a parameter-efficient way. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets with different numbers of modalities, where Wander outperforms state-of-the-art efficient transfer learning methods consistently. The results fully demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and universality of Wander.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce an innovative interactive global geolocation assistant named GaGA, built upon the flourishing large vision-language models (LVLMs). GaGA uncovers geographical clues within images and combines them with the extensive world knowledge embedded in LVLMs to determine the geolocations while also providing justifications and explanations for the prediction results. We further designed a novel interactive geolocation method that surpasses traditional static inference approaches. It allows users to intervene, correct, or provide clues for the predictions, making the model more flexible and practical. The development of GaGA relies on the newly proposed Multi-modal Global Geolocation (MG-Geo) dataset, a comprehensive collection of 5 million high-quality image-text pairs. GaGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GWS15k dataset, improving accuracy by 4.57% at the country level and 2.92% at the city level, setting a new benchmark. These advancements represent a significant leap forward in developing highly accurate, interactive geolocation systems with global applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08755v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p></details> |  |

While typical visual tasks perform well with low-resolution inputs, reading-intensive applications demand high-resolution, resulting in significant computational overhead. Using OCR-extracted text in VLM prompts partially addresses this issue but underperforms compared to full-resolution counterpart, as it lacks the complete visual context needed for optimal performance. We introduce DocVLM, a method that integrates an OCR-based modality into VLMs to enhance document processing while preserving original weights. Our approach employs an OCR encoder to capture textual content and layout, compressing these into a compact set of learned queries incorporated into the VLM. Comprehensive evaluations across leading VLMs show that DocVLM significantly reduces reliance on high-resolution images for document understanding. In limited-token regimes (448$\times$448), DocVLM with 64 learned queries improves DocVQA results from 56.0% to 86.6% when integrated with InternVL2 and from 84.4% to 91.2% with Qwen2-VL. In LLaVA-OneVision, DocVLM achieves improved results while using 80% less image tokens. The reduced token usage allows processing multiple pages effectively, showing impressive zero-shot results on DUDE and state-of-the-art performance on MP-DocVQA, highlighting DocVLM's potential for applications requiring high-performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes. During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Evaluating automatic metrics for text-to-image consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13989v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models are increasingly being incorporated as components in larger AI systems for various purposes, from prompt optimization to automatic evaluation. In this work, we analyze the construct validity of four recent, commonly used methods for measuring text-to-image consistency - CLIPScore, TIFA, VPEval, and DSG - which rely on language models and/or VQA models as components. We define construct validity for text-image consistency metrics as a set of desiderata that text-image consistency metrics should have, and find that no tested metric satisfies all of them. We find that metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to language and visual properties. Next, we find that TIFA, VPEval and DSG contribute novel information above and beyond CLIPScore, but also that they correlate highly with each other. We also ablate different aspects of the text-image consistency metrics and find that not all model components are strictly necessary, also a symptom of insufficient sensitivity to visual information. Finally, we show that all three VQA-based metrics likely rely on familiar text shortcuts (such as yes-bias in QA) that call their aptitude as quantitative evaluations of model performance into question.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at COLM 2024</p></details> |

On X (formerly Twitter), for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag #anger, while in a news headline, emotions are typically written in a more polite, indirect manner. To enable conditional text generation models to create emotionally connotated texts that fit a domain, users need to have access to a parameter that allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To achieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization methodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives (which correspond here to the output probabilities assigned by emotion classifiers trained for different domains). In contrast to single objective optimization, MOPO outputs a set of prompts, each with a different weighting of the multiple objectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their context. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various domain-specific emotion classifiers. MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp across all objectives with a minimal loss (1-2 pp) for any single objective compared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are offset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives - which is not possible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces computational requirements by simultaneously optimizing for multiple objectives, eliminating separate optimization procedures for each objective.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to COLING 2025</p></details> |

Automatic prompt optimization can support the prompt development process, but requires annotated data. This paper introduces $\textit{iPrOp}$, a novel Interactive Prompt Optimization system, to bridge manual prompt engineering and automatic prompt optimization. With human intervention in the optimization loop, $\textit{iPrOp}$ offers users the flexibility to assess evolving prompts. We present users with prompt variations, selected instances, large language model predictions accompanied by corresponding explanations, and performance metrics derived from a subset of the training data. This approach empowers users to choose and further refine the provided prompts based on their individual preferences and needs. This system not only assists non-technical domain experts in generating optimal prompts tailored to their specific tasks or domains, but also enables to study the intrinsic parameters that influence the performance of prompt optimization. Our evaluation shows that our system has the capability to generate improved prompts, leading to enhanced task performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Semantic-Aware Representation in Visual-Language Models for Multi-Label Recognition with Partial Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10843v1)** | 2024-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-label recognition with partial labels (MLR-PL), in which only some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is a practical task in computer vision, since collecting large-scale and complete multi-label datasets is difficult in real application scenarios. Recently, vision language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated impressive transferability to downstream tasks in data limited or label limited settings. However, current CLIP-based methods suffer from semantic confusion in MLR task due to the lack of fine-grained information in the single global visual and textual representation for all categories. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a semantic decoupling module and a category-specific prompt optimization method in CLIP-based framework. Specifically, the semantic decoupling module following the visual encoder learns category-specific feature maps by utilizing the semantic-guided spatial attention mechanism. Moreover, the category-specific prompt optimization method is introduced to learn text representations aligned with category semantics. Therefore, the prediction of each category is independent, which alleviate the semantic confusion problem. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO 2014 and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-art methods with a simpler model structure. Additionally, visual analysis shows that our method effectively separates information from different categories and achieves better performance compared to CLIP-based baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing Communications and Applications</p></details> |

Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning. Code of GReaTer is available at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/GreaTer.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10882v6)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wu-zongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08639v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings.

| **[What Should We Engineer in Prompts? Training Humans in Requirement-Driven LLM Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v2)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs for complex tasks (e.g., building a trip advisor chatbot) needs humans to clearly articulate customized requirements (e.g., "start the response with a tl;dr"). However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and "think step-by-step"). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[BudgetFusion: Perceptually-Guided Adaptive Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05780v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown unprecedented success in the task of text-to-image generation. While these models are capable of generating high-quality and realistic images, the complexity of sequential denoising has raised societal concerns regarding high computational demands and energy consumption. In response, various efforts have been made to improve inference efficiency. However, most of the existing efforts have taken a fixed approach with neural network simplification or text prompt optimization. Are the quality improvements from all denoising computations equally perceivable to humans? We observed that images from different text prompts may require different computational efforts given the desired content. The observation motivates us to present BudgetFusion, a novel model that suggests the most perceptually efficient number of diffusion steps before a diffusion model starts to generate an image. This is achieved by predicting multi-level perceptual metrics relative to diffusion steps. With the popular Stable Diffusion as an example, we conduct both numerical analyses and user studies. Our experiments show that BudgetFusion saves up to five seconds per prompt without compromising perceptual similarity. We hope this work can initiate efforts toward answering a core question: how much do humans perceptually gain from images created by a generative model, per watt of energy?</p></details> |  |
| **[RAP-SR: RestorAtion Prior Enhancement in Diffusion Models for Realistic Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07149v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from their powerful generative capabilities, pretrained diffusion models have garnered significant attention for real-world image super-resolution (Real-SR). Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically utilize semantic information from degraded images and restoration prompts to activate prior for producing realistic high-resolution images. However, general-purpose pretrained diffusion models, not designed for restoration tasks, often have suboptimal prior, and manually defined prompts may fail to fully exploit the generated potential. To address these limitations, we introduce RAP-SR, a novel restoration prior enhancement approach in pretrained diffusion models for Real-SR. First, we develop the High-Fidelity Aesthetic Image Dataset (HFAID), curated through a Quality-Driven Aesthetic Image Selection Pipeline (QDAISP). Our dataset not only surpasses existing ones in fidelity but also excels in aesthetic quality. Second, we propose the Restoration Priors Enhancement Framework, which includes Restoration Priors Refinement (RPR) and Restoration-Oriented Prompt Optimization (ROPO) modules. RPR refines the restoration prior using the HFAID, while ROPO optimizes the unique restoration identifier, improving the quality of the resulting images. RAP-SR effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose models and the demands of Real-SR by enhancing restoration prior. Leveraging the plug-and-play nature of RAP-SR, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing diffusion-based SR methods, boosting their performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its broad applicability and state-of-the-art results. Codes and datasets will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.</p></details> |  |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Improving LLM Group Fairness on Tabular Data via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04642v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective on tabular prediction tasks in the low-data regime, leveraging their internal knowledge and ability to learn from instructions and examples. However, LLMs can fail to generate predictions that satisfy group fairness, that is, produce equitable outcomes across groups. Critically, conventional debiasing approaches for natural language tasks do not directly translate to mitigating group unfairness in tabular settings. In this work, we systematically investigate four empirical approaches to improve group fairness of LLM predictions on tabular datasets, including fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic selection of few-shot examples, and self-refining predictions via chain-of-thought reasoning. Through experiments on four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we show the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining high overall performance. Our analysis provides actionable insights for practitioners in selecting the most suitable approach based on their specific requirements and constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04291v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have highlighted that large language models (LLMs), when given a small set of task-specific examples, demonstrate remarkable proficiency, a capability that extends to complex reasoning tasks. In particular, the combination of few-shot learning with the chain-of-thought (CoT) approach has been pivotal in steering models towards more logically consistent conclusions. This paper explores the optimization of example selection for designing effective CoT pre-prompts and shows that the choice of the optimization algorithm, typically in favor of comparison-based methods such as evolutionary computation, significantly enhances efficacy and feasibility. Specifically, thanks to a limited exploitative and overfitted optimization, Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) brings an improvement over the naive few-shot approach exceeding 10 absolute points in exact match scores on benchmark datasets such as GSM8k and MathQA. These gains are consistent across various contexts and are further amplified when integrated with self-consistency (SC)</p></details> |  |

There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs across wireless transmission but also require more computing resources and processing time, impacting the overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression. When prioritizing compression, our framework achieves up to 16x compression ratio while maintaining acceptable fidelity (within 30% reduction). Compared to no compression, baseline single-round compression with a 16x compression ratio reduces the system total response time by approximately 42.3%, while the denoising-inspired method achieves a 46.5% service time-saving.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[Revolve: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03092v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. These advantages highlight its adaptability and efficiency, positioning REVOLVE as a valuable tool for optimizing LLM-based systems and accelerating the development of next-generation AI technologies.

| **[Keeping Experts in the Loop: Expert-Guided Optimization for Clinical Data Classification using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02173v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of effectively leveraging their potential in healthcare has taken center stage. A critical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role in determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization remains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt refinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to create an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or through employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of the input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose StructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the input of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the framework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies high-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance improvements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively enhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling redundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We evaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified clinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared to current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in LLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining minimal expert effort. By combining transparency, flexibility, and scalability, StructEase sets the foundation for a framework to integrate expert input into LLM workflows in healthcare and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones.

Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14985v4)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth. We also show the practical implications of our analysis through a novel prompt optimization algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated 10-page version</p></details> |

Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs.

| **[TIPO: Text to Image with Text Presampling for Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08127v2)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TIPO (Text to Image with text pre-sampling for Prompt Optimization) is an innovative framework designed to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation by language model (LM) for automatic prompt engineering. By refining and extending user-provided prompts, TIPO bridges the gap between simple inputs and the detailed prompts required for high-quality image generation. Unlike previous approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO adjusts user input prompts with the distribution of a trained prompt dataset, eliminating the need for complex runtime cost via lightweight model. This pre-sampling approach enables efficient and scalable prompt optimization, grounded in the model's training distribution. Experimental results demonstrate TIPO's effectiveness in improving aesthetic scores, reducing image corruption, and better aligning generated images with dataset distributions. These findings highlight the critical role of prompt engineering in T2I systems and open avenues for broader applications of automatic prompt refinement.</p></details> | 26 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Latent Schrodinger Bridge: Prompting Latent Diffusion for Fast Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14863v1)** | 2024-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs), which enable both image generation from noise and inversion from data, have inspired powerful unpaired image-to-image (I2I) translation algorithms. However, they often require a larger number of neural function evaluations (NFEs), limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recent works discovered that the performance of LLMs is heavily dependent on the input prompt. However, prompt engineering is usually done manually in a trial-and-error fashion, which can be labor-intensive and challenging in order to find the optimal prompts. To address these problems and unleash the utmost potential of LLMs, we propose a novel LLMs-agnostic framework for prompt optimization, namely GRL-Prompt, which aims to automatically construct optimal prompts via reinforcement learning (RL) in an end-to-end manner. To provide structured action/state representation for optimizing prompts, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) that better encodes the correlation between the user query and candidate in-context examples. Furthermore, a policy network is formulated to generate the optimal action by selecting a set of in-context examples in a rewardable order to construct the prompt. Additionally, the embedding-based reward shaping is utilized to stabilize the RL training process. The experimental results show that GRL-Prompt outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average increase of 0.10 in ROUGE-1, 0.07 in ROUGE-2, 0.07 in ROUGE-L, and 0.05 in BLEU.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image priors with 3D representation methods, e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to feed-forward generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. An obstacle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end feed-forward approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the spatial feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.</p></details> |  |

Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |

Although previous research has explored aspects like rephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context learning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our understanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM performance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable templates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their impact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and translation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance varies by up to 40\% in a code translation task depending on the prompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these variations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed prompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Self-alignment seeks to reduce these expenses by enabling models to align themselves. To further lower costs and achieve alignment without any expensive tuning or annotations, we introduce a new tuning-free approach for self-alignment, Dynamic Rewarding with Prompt Optimization (DRPO). Our approach leverages a search-based optimization framework that allows LLMs to iteratively self-improve and craft the optimal alignment instructions, all without additional training or human intervention. The core of DRPO is a dynamic rewarding mechanism, which identifies and rectifies model-specific alignment weaknesses, allowing LLMs to adapt efficiently to diverse alignment challenges. Empirical evaluations on eight recent LLMs, both open- and closed-sourced, demonstrate that DRPO significantly enhances alignment performance, with base models outperforming their SFT/RLHF-tuned counterparts. Moreover, the prompts automatically optimized by DRPO surpass those curated by human experts, further validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings highlight the great potential of current LLMs to achieve adaptive self-alignment through inference-time optimization, complementing tuning-based alignment methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |

However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at NAACL 2025.

Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi.</p></details> |  |
| **[SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06426v1)** | 2024-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |

On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v2)** | 2024-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar optimization, EO). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO receiving more research attention recently. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and EO techniques both isolation and combination on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars, consistently improves performance on top of IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with EO strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe a synergy between EO and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing the individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar optimization both as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remain a crucial aspect of APO and deserve greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded version of the NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |

By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</p></details> |  |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization -- using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest.

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability to news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first self-tuning prompting framework for news recommendation, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex news recommendation tasks. This framework incorporates a news recommender and a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process to enhance recommendations through automatic prompt engineering. Extensive experimental results with 400 users show that RecPrompt can achieve an improvement of 3.36% in AUC, 10.49% in MRR, 9.64% in nDCG@5, and 6.20% in nDCG@10 compared to deep neural models. Additionally, we introduce TopicScore, a novel metric to assess explainability by evaluating LLM's ability to summarize topics of interest for users. The results show LLM's effectiveness in accurately identifying topics of interest and delivering comprehensive topic-based explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://imprompter.ai code: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter v2 changelog: add new results to Table 3, correct several typos</p></details> |

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods.

Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning.

In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs.

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively).

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training.

| **[Benchmarking Large Language Model Uncertainty for Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10044v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in multi-step reasoning but still lack effective uncertainty estimation. This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

| **[Human-Free Automated Prompting for Vision-Language Anomaly Detection: Prompt Optimization with Meta-guiding Prompt Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Robot Failure Recovery Using Vision-Language Models With Optimized Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03966v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robot autonomy struggles to operate beyond the assumed Operational Design Domain (ODD), the specific set of conditions and environments in which the system is designed to function, while the real-world is rife with uncertainties that may lead to failures. Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00262v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios.

FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |
