| **[Statistical Properties of Deep Neural Networks with Dependent Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11113v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>85 pa...</summary><p>85 pages, 2 figures, removed partially linear model section and uploaded as a separate paper (arXiv:2410.22574v1)</p></details> |
| **[Formal Logic-guided Robust Federated Learning against Poisoning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03231v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising solution to the privacy concerns associated with centralized Machine Learning (ML) by enabling decentralized, collaborative learning. However, FL is vulnerable to various security threats, including poisoning attacks, where adversarial clients manipulate the training data or model updates to degrade overall model performance. Recognizing this threat, researchers have focused on developing defense mechanisms to counteract poisoning attacks in FL systems. However, existing robust FL methods predominantly focus on computer vision tasks, leaving a gap in addressing the unique challenges of FL with time series data. In this paper, we present FLORAL, a defense mechanism designed to mitigate poisoning attacks in federated learning for time-series tasks, even in scenarios with heterogeneous client data and a large number of adversarial participants. Unlike traditional model-centric defenses, FLORAL leverages logical reasoning to evaluate client trustworthiness by aligning their predictions with global time-series patterns, rather than relying solely on the similarity of client updates. Our approach extracts logical reasoning properties from clients, then hierarchically infers global properties, and uses these to verify client updates. Through formal logic verification, we assess the robustness of each client contribution, identifying deviations indicative of adversarial behavior. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baseline methods, highlighting its potential to enhance the robustness of FL to time series applications. Notably, FLORAL reduced the prediction error by 93.27\% in the best-case scenario compared to the second-best baseline. Our code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FLORAL-Robust-FTS}.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2305.00328 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Predictive Models for Healthcare via Rational Logistic Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03224v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The healthcare sector has experienced a rapid accumulation of digital data recently, especially in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs constitute a precious resource that IS researchers could utilize for clinical applications (e.g., morbidity prediction). Deep learning seems like the obvious choice to exploit this surfeit of data. However, numerous studies have shown that deep learning does not enjoy the same kind of success on EHR data as it has in other domains; simple models like logistic regression are frequently as good as sophisticated deep learning ones. Inspired by this observation, we develop a novel model called rational logistic regression (RLR) that has standard logistic regression (LR) as its special case (and thus inherits LR's inductive bias that aligns with EHR data). RLR has rational series as its theoretical underpinnings, works on longitudinal time-series data, and learns interpretable patterns. Empirical comparisons on real-world clinical tasks demonstrate RLR's efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICIS ...</summary><p>ICIS 2021 Proceedings ( see https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2021/is_health/is_health/18 )</p></details> |
| **[FUSE: Fast Unified Simulation and Estimation for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14558v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMUDiffusion: A Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Synthetisation for Inertial Motion Capturing Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02954v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kinematic sensors are often used to analyze movement behaviors in sports and daily activities due to their ease of use and lack of spatial restrictions, unlike video-based motion capturing systems. Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Time-Causal VAE: Robust Financial Time Series Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02947v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We build a time-causal variational autoencoder (TC-VAE) for robust generation of financial time series data. Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Capturing research literature attitude towards Sustainable Development Goals: an LLM-based topic modeling approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02943v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world is facing a multitude of challenges that hinder the development of human civilization and the well-being of humanity on the planet. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in 2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing techniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We propose a completely automated pipeline to 1) fetch content from the Scopus database and prepare datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; 2) perform topic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large collections of textual data; and 3) enable topic exploration through keywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic modeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large corpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of thousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings computation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and ii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for any new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on interactive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made inspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic modeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text datasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude toward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the results are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized to be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Mamba Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02941v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving patterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce. However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16713v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI), a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends the current state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation methods by introducing key modifications specifically adapted to EHR data characteristics, namely: a) an attention-based hidden state initialisation technique to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) a domain-informed temporal decay mechanism to adjust the imputation process to clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural architectures in data restoration and downstream predictive tasks. Additionally, CSAI is integrated within PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Frequencies Are Created Equal:Towards a Dynamic Fusion of Frequencies in Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12415v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF. The code is available at https://github.com/Zh-XY22/FreDF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Domain Pre-training with Language Models for Transferable Time Series Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specialized Foundation Models Struggle to Beat Supervised Baselines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02796v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01623v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06676v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of ADHD using EEG has attracted the attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. However, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, the persistence image method is employed to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 78.27%, 80.62%, and 75.63%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SageFormer: Series-Aware Framework for Long-term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01616v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the burgeoning ecosystem of Internet of Things, multivariate time series (MTS) data has become ubiquitous, highlighting the fundamental role of time series forecasting across numerous applications. The crucial challenge of long-term MTS forecasting requires adept models capable of capturing both intra- and inter-series dependencies. Recent advancements in deep learning, notably Transformers, have shown promise. However, many prevailing methods either marginalize inter-series dependencies or overlook them entirely. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel series-aware framework, explicitly designed to emphasize the significance of such dependencies. At the heart of this framework lies our specific implementation: the SageFormer. As a Series-aware Graph-enhanced Transformer model, SageFormer proficiently discerns and models the intricate relationships between series using graph structures. Beyond capturing diverse temporal patterns, it also curtails redundant information across series. Notably, the series-aware framework seamlessly integrates with existing Transformer-based models, enriching their ability to comprehend inter-series relationships. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the superior performance of SageFormer against contemporary state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 11, Issue: 10, 15 May 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Compositional simulation-based inference for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02728v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized simulation-based inference (SBI) methods train neural networks on simulated data to perform Bayesian inference. While this approach avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time-series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI framework that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million dimensions in the data domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, submitted for a publication</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Forecasting with Coherent Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09797v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining accurate probabilistic forecasts is an important operational challenge in many applications, like energy management, climate forecast, supply chain planning, and resource allocation. In many of these applications, there is a natural hierarchical structure over the forecasted quantities; and forecasting systems that adhere to this hierarchical structure are said to be coherent. Furthermore, operational planning benefits from accuracy at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. Building accurate and coherent forecasting systems, however, is challenging: classic multivariate time series tools and neural network methods are still being adapted for this purpose. In this paper, we augment an MQForecaster neural network architecture with a novel deep Gaussian factor forecasting model that achieves coherence by construction, yielding a method we call the Deep Coherent Factor Model Neural Network (DeepCoFactor) model. DeepCoFactor generates samples that can be differentiated with respect to the model parameters, allowing optimization on various sample-based learning objectives that align with the forecasting system's goals, including quantile loss and the scaled Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In a comparison to state-of-the-art coherent forecasting methods, DeepCoFactor achieves significant improvements in scaled CRPS forecast accuracy, with average gains of 15%, as measured on six publicly-available forecasting datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages of main text.

| **[Towards more efficient agricultural practices via transformer-based crop type classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02627v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has great potential to increase crop production and resilience to climate change. Accurate maps of where crops are grown are a key input to a number of downstream policy and research applications. In this proposal, we present preliminary work showing that it is possible to accurately classify crops from time series derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite imagery in Mexico using a pixel-based binary crop/non-crop time series transformer model. We also find preliminary evidence that meta-learning approaches supplemented with data from similar agro-ecological zones may improve model performance. Due to these promising results, we propose further development of this method with the goal of accurate multi-class crop classification in Jalisco, Mexico via meta-learning with a dataset comprising similar agro-ecological zones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing and Evaluating Sampling Strategies for Multiple-Forecast Visualization (MFV)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02576v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing availability of quantitative forecasts from various sources, effectively communicating these multiple forecasts has become increasingly crucial. Recent advances have explored using Multiple-Forecast Visualizations (MFVs) to display multiple time-series forecasts. However, how to systematically sample from a pool of disparate forecasts to create MFVs that effectively facilitate decision-making requires further investigation. To address this challenge, we examine two cluster-based sampling strategies for creating MFVs and three designs for visualizing them to assist people in decision-making with forecasts. Through two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 711 and Experiment 2 n = 400) and over 15 decision-making-related metrics, we evaluated participants' perceptions of eight visualization designs using historical COVID-19 forecasts as a test bed. Our findings revealed that one sampling method significantly enhanced participants' ability to predict future outcomes, thereby reducing their surprise when confronted with the actual outcomes. Importantly, since no approach excels in all metrics, we advise choosing different visualization designs based on communication goals. Furthermore, qualitative response data demonstrate a correlation between response consistency and people's inclination to extrapolate from the forecast segment of the visualization. This research offers insights into how to improve visualizations of multiple forecasts using an automated and empirically validated technique for selecting forecasts that outperform common techniques on several key metrics and reduce overplotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Risk Assessment in Transformers with Loss-at-Risk Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02558v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the financial field, precise risk assessment tools are essential for decision-making. Recent studies have challenged the notion that traditional network loss functions like Mean Square Error (MSE) are adequate, especially under extreme risk conditions that can lead to significant losses during market upheavals. Transformers and Transformer-based models are now widely used in financial forecasting according to their outstanding performance in time-series-related predictions. However, these models typically lack sensitivity to extreme risks and often underestimate great financial losses. To address this problem, we introduce a novel loss function, the Loss-at-Risk, which incorporates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) into Transformer models. This integration allows Transformer models to recognize potential extreme losses and further improves their capability to handle high-stakes financial decisions. Moreover, we conduct a series of experiments with highly volatile financial datasets to demonstrate that our Loss-at-Risk function improves the Transformers' risk prediction and management capabilities without compromising their decision-making accuracy or efficiency. The results demonstrate that integrating risk-aware metrics during training enhances the Transformers' risk assessment capabilities while preserving their core strengths in decision-making and reasoning across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICKG 2024</p></details> |

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and model checkpoints available at https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |
| **[EMGBench: Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Generalization and Adaptation for Electromyography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23625v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first generalization and adaptation benchmark using machine learning for evaluating out-of-distribution performance of electromyography (EMG) classification algorithms. The ability of an EMG classifier to handle inputs drawn from a different distribution than the training distribution is critical for real-world deployment as a control interface. By predicting the user's intended gesture using EMG signals, we can create a wearable solution to control assistive technologies, such as computers, prosthetics, and mobile manipulator robots. This new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two major tasks that have utility for building robust and adaptable control interfaces: 1) intersubject classification and 2) adaptation using train-test splits for time-series. This benchmark spans nine datasets--the largest collection of EMG datasets in a benchmark. Among these, a new dataset is introduced, featuring a novel, easy-to-wear high-density EMG wearable for data collection. The lack of open-source benchmarks has made comparing accuracy results between papers challenging for the EMG research community. This new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable resource for analyzing practical measures of out-of-distribution performance for EMG datasets. Our code and data from our new dataset can be found at emgbench.github.io.</p></details> |  |

We assess the detection accuracy of these approaches and their potential to pinpoint the locations of specific sensor measurements under attack. Given the demonstrated success of GNNs in other time-series anomaly detection applications, we aim to evaluate their performance within the context of power systems cyber-attacks on sensor measurements. Utilizing the IEEE 68-bus system, we simulated four types of false data attacks, including scaling attacks, additive attacks, and their combinations, to test the selected approaches. Our results indicate that GNN-based methods outperform k-means and autoencoder in detection. Additionally, GNNs show promise in accurately localizing attacks for simple scenarios, although they still face challenges in more complex cases, especially ones that involve combinations of scaling and additive attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Learning of Asymptotic Variational Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02217v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General state-space models (SSMs) are widely used in statistical machine learning and are among the most classical generative models for sequential time-series data. SSMs, comprising latent Markovian states, can be subjected to variational inference (VI), but standard VI methods like the importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) lack functionality for streaming data. To enable online VI in SSMs when the observations are received in real time, we propose maximising an IWAE-type variational lower bound on the asymptotic contrast function, rather than the standard IWAE ELBO, using stochastic approximation. Unlike the recursive maximum likelihood method, which directly maximises the asymptotic contrast, our approach, called online sequential IWAE (OSIWAE), allows for online learning of both model parameters and a Markovian recognition model for inferring latent states. By approximating filter state posteriors and their derivatives using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, we create a particle-based framework for online VI in SSMs. This approach is more theoretically well-founded than recently proposed online variational SMC methods. We provide rigorous theoretical results on the learning objective and a numerical study demonstrating the method's efficiency in learning model parameters and particle proposal kernels.</p></details> |  |

Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, although this effect is present in both hemispheres, it is stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere. Specifically, the left-right difference in brain correlation follows a scaling law with the number of parameters. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[QBSD: Quartile-Based Seasonality Decomposition for Cost-Effective RAN KPI Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05989v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting time series patterns, such as cell key performance indicators (KPIs) of radio access networks (RAN), plays a vital role in enhancing service quality and operational efficiency. State-of-the-art forecasting approaches prioritize accuracy at the expense of computational performance, rendering them less suitable for data-intensive applications encompassing systems with a multitude of time series variables. They also do not capture the effect of dynamic operating ranges that vary with time. To address this issue, we introduce QBSD, a live single-step forecasting approach tailored to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The method has shown significant success with our real network RAN KPI datasets of over several thousand cells. In this article, we showcase the performance of QBSD in comparison to other forecasting approaches on a dataset we have made publicly available. The results demonstrate that the proposed method excels in runtime efficiency compared to the leading algorithms available while maintaining competitive forecast accuracy that rivals neural forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |

Anomalies in web service data, for example, can signal critical incidents such as system failures or server malfunctions, necessitating timely detection and response. However, most existing TSAD methodologies rely heavily on manual feature engineering or require extensive labeled training data, while also offering limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering framework called the Time Series Anomaly Multimodal Analyzer (TAMA), which leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance both the detection and interpretation of anomalies in time series data. By converting time series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA leverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on extensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous experimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides rich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into the nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first open-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type labels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and advancement within this critical field. Ultimately, TAMA not only excels in anomaly detection but also provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the underlying causes of anomalies, pushing TSAD forward through innovative methodologies and insights.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite the recent strides in crafting specific architectures for time-series forecasting and developing pre-trained universal models, a comprehensive examination of their capability in accommodating varied-horizon forecasting during inference is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap through the design and evaluation of the Elastic Time-Series Transformer (ElasTST). The ElasTST model incorporates a non-autoregressive design with placeholders and structured self-attention masks, warranting future outputs that are invariant to adjustments in inference horizons. A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated into ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability to different horizons. Additionally, ElasTST employs a multi-scale patch design, effectively integrating both fine-grained and coarse-grained information. During the training phase, ElasTST uses a horizon reweighting strategy that approximates the effect of random sampling across multiple horizons with a single fixed horizon setting. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art time-series architectures and contemporary foundation models, we demonstrate the efficacy of ElasTST's unique design elements. Our findings position ElasTST as a robust solution for the practical necessity of varied-horizon forecasting.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Coherent Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Demand](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00337v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) significantly changes typical load curves in smart grids. With the development of fast charging technology, the volatility of EV charging demand is increasing, which requires additional flexibility for real-time power balance. The forecasting of EV charging demand involves probabilistic modeling of high dimensional time series dynamics across diverse electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper studies the forecasting problem of multiple EVCS in a hierarchical probabilistic manner. For each charging station, a deep learning model based on a partial input convex neural network (PICNN) is trained to predict the day-ahead charging demand's conditional distribution, preventing the common quantile crossing problem in traditional quantile regression models. Then, differentiable convex optimization layers (DCLs) are used to reconcile the scenarios sampled from the distributions to yield coherent scenarios that satisfy the hierarchical constraint. It learns a better weight matrix for adjusting the forecasting results of different targets in a machine-learning approach compared to traditional optimization-based hierarchical reconciling methods. Numerical experiments based on real-world EV charging data are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for IEEE Transactions on Industrial Applications.

| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters challenges when modeling complex dynamical systems involving high-order derivatives or discontinuities, particularly in the presence of noise. These limitations restrict its applicability across various fields in applied mathematics and physics. To mitigate these, we propose Laplace-Enhanced SparSe Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (LES-SINDy). By transforming time-series measurements from the time domain to the Laplace domain using the Laplace transform and integration by parts, LES-SINDy enables more accurate approximations of derivatives and discontinuous terms. It also effectively handles unbounded growth functions and accumulated numerical errors in the Laplace domain, thereby overcoming challenges in the identification process. The model evaluation process selects the most accurate and parsimonious dynamical systems from multiple candidates. Experimental results across diverse ordinary and partial differential equations show that LES-SINDy achieves superior robustness, accuracy, and parsimony compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 47 pages, 5 figures |

Especially chaotic time series that depend on a long history pose an exceptionally difficult problem. While machine learning has shown to be a promising approach for predicting such time series, it either demands long training time and much training data when using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Alternative, when using a Reservoir Computing approach it comes with high uncertainty and typically a high number of random initializations and extensive hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we focus on the Reservoir Computing approach and propose a new mapping of input data into the reservoir's state space. Furthermore, we incorporate this method in two novel network architectures increasing parallelizability, depth and predictive capabilities of the neural network while reducing the dependence on randomness. For the evaluation, we approximate a set of time series from the Mackey-Glass equation, inhabiting non-chaotic as well as chaotic behavior as well as the SantaFe Laser dataset and compare our approaches in regard to their predictive capabilities to Echo State Networks, Autoencoder connected Echo State Networks and Gated Recurrent Units. For the chaotic time series, we observe an error reduction of up to $85.45\%$ compared to Echo State Networks and $90.72\%$ compared to Gated Recurrent Units. Furthermore, we also observe tremendous improvements for non-chaotic time series of up to $99.99\%$ in contrast to the existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Graph Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01567v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. Recent advances in GSP have enabled the learning of graph structures from observed signals, but these methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. Adaptive filtering techniques, while effective for online learning, have seen limited application in graph topology estimation from a GSP perspective. To this end, we introduce AdaCGP, an online algorithm for adaptive estimation of the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) from multivariate time series. The GSO is estimated from an adaptive time-vertex autoregressive model through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance and bias. Through simulations, we show that AdaCGP performs consistently well across various graph topologies, and achieves improvements in excess of 82% for GSO estimation compared to baseline adaptive vector autoregressive models. In addition, our online variable splitting approach for enforcing sparsity enables near-perfect precision in identifying causal connections while maintaining low false positive rates upon optimisation of the forecast error. Finally, AdaCGP's ability to track changes in graph structure is demonstrated on recordings of ventricular fibrillation dynamics in response to an anti-arrhythmic drug. AdaCGP is shown to be able to identify the stability of critical conduction patterns that may be maintaining the arrhythmia in an intuitive way, together with its potential to support diagnosis and treatment strategies.</p></details> |  |

Advances in end-to-end rPPG approaches have focused on this transformation where attention mechanisms are crucial for feature extraction. However, existing methods compute attention disjointly across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. Here, we propose the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), which jointly computes multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings using nonnegative matrix factorization. To demonstrate FSAM's effectiveness, we developed FactorizePhys, an end-to-end 3D-CNN architecture for estimating blood volume pulse signals from raw video frames. Our approach adeptly factorizes voxel embeddings to achieve comprehensive spatial, temporal, and channel attention, enhancing performance of generic signal extraction tasks. Furthermore, we deploy FSAM within an existing 2D-CNN-based rPPG architecture to illustrate its versatility. FSAM and FactorizePhys are thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art rPPG methods, each representing different types of architecture and attention mechanism. We perform ablation studies to investigate the architectural decisions and hyperparameters of FSAM. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and intuitive visualization of learned spatial-temporal features substantiate the effectiveness of FSAM and enhanced cross-dataset generalization in estimating rPPG signals, suggesting its broader potential as a multidimensional attention mechanism.

Despite the advancements in deep learning methods for TSF, their capacity to predict long-term series remains constrained. This limitation arises from the failure to account for both intra- and inter-variable variations meanwhile. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce the Fi$^2$VBlock, which leverages a \textbf{F}requency domain perspective to capture \textbf{i}ntra- and \textbf{i}nter-variable \textbf{V}ariations. After transforming into the frequency domain via the Frequency Transform Module, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtain enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. Furthermore, Inception blocks are employed to integrate information, thus capturing correlations across different variables. Our backbone network, Fi$^2$VTS, employs a residual architecture by concatenating multiple Fi$^2$VBlocks, thereby preventing degradation issues. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Fi$^2$VTS achieves a substantial reduction in both time and memory complexity, decreasing from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ per Fi$^2$VBlock computation. Empirical evaluations reveal that Fi$^2$VTS outperforms other baselines on two benchmark datasets.

This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for time series forecasting, incorporating two key innovations: parameter sharing (PS) and Spatial-Temporal Segment Attention (SegAtt). We also define the time series segment as the concatenation of sequence patches from the same positions across different variables. The proposed model, PSformer, reduces the number of training parameters through the parameter sharing mechanism, thereby improving model efficiency and scalability. The introduction of SegAtt could enhance the capability of capturing local spatio-temporal dependencies by computing attention over the segments, and improve global representation by integrating information across segments. The combination of parameter sharing and SegAtt significantly improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSformer outperforms popular baselines and other transformer-based approaches in terms of accuracy and scalability, establishing itself as an accurate and scalable tool for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Irregular Time-Series Analysis and Integrated Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We develop the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), a novel machine learning-based model to forecast the next BG level, classifying it into hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia (70-180 mg/dL). The irregularity and complexity of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, spanning multiple heterogeneous clinical sources like lab results, medications, and vital signs, pose significant challenges for prediction tasks. MITST addresses these using hierarchical Transformer architectures, which include a feature-level, a timestamp-level, and a source-level Transformer. This design captures fine-grained temporal dynamics and allows learning-based data integration instead of traditional predefined aggregation. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly higher than the baseline's AUROC of 0.862 and AUPRC of 0.208 (p < 0.001). The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability in clinical decision support. Although this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

We propose a novel Hyperbox Mixture Regression (HMR) model which employs hyperbox-based input space partitioning to enhance predictive accuracy while managing uncertainty inherent in bioprocess data. The HMR model is designed to dynamically generate hyperboxes for input samples in a single-pass process, thereby improving learning speed and reducing computational complexity. Our experimental study utilizes a dataset that contains 106 bioreactors. This study evaluates the model's performance in predicting critical quality attributes in monoclonal antibody manufacturing over a 15-day cultivation period. The results demonstrate that the HMR model outperforms comparable approximators in accuracy and learning speed and maintains interpretability and robustness under uncertain conditions. These findings underscore the potential of HMR as a powerful tool for enhancing predictive analytics in bioprocessing applications.</p></details> |  |

However, forecasting is challenging in practice due to variable medication administration and unique pharmacokinetic (PK) properties for each patient. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid global-local architecture and a PK encoder that informs deep learning models of patient-specific treatment effects. We showcase the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant accuracy gains for a blood glucose forecasting task using both realistically simulated and real-world data. Our hybrid global-local architecture improves over patient-specific models by 15.8% on average. Additionally, our PK encoder surpasses baselines by up to 16.4% on simulated data and 4.9% on real-world data for individual patients during critical events of severely high and low glucose levels.</p></details> |  |

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v3)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability.

| **[Multivariate Time Series Cleaning under Speed Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01214v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Errors are common in time series due to unreliable sensor measurements. Existing methods focus on univariate data but do not utilize the correlation between dimensions. Cleaning each dimension separately may lead to a less accurate result, as some errors can only be identified in the multivariate case. We also point out that the widely used minimum change principle is not always the best choice. Instead, we try to change the smallest number of data to avoid a significant change in the data distribution. In this paper, we propose MTCSC, the constraint-based method for cleaning multivariate time series. We formalize the repair problem, propose a linear-time method to employ online computing, and improve it by exploiting data trends. We also support adaptive speed constraint capturing. We analyze the properties of our proposals and compare them with SOTA methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency versus error rates, data sizes, and applications such as classification. Experiments on real datasets show that MTCSC can have higher repair accuracy with less time consumption. Interestingly, it can be effective even when there are only weak or no correlations between the dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 16 figures, conference</p></details> |

Its primary goal is to enhance the adaptability and resilience of machine learning models when faced with new, unseen, and potentially adversarial data that significantly diverges from their original training datasets. In this paper, we investigate time series OOD generalization via pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We first propose a novel \textbf{T}ri-level learning framework for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{O}OD generalization, termed TTSO, which considers both sample-level and group-level uncertainties. This formula offers a fresh theoretic perspective for formulating and analyzing OOD generalization problem. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify this method is well motivated. We then develop a stratified localization algorithm tailored for this tri-level optimization problem, theoretically demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis also reveals that the iteration complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is bounded by O($\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstracted Shapes as Tokens -- A Generalizable and Interpretable Model for Time-series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01006v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2024</p></details> |

Additionally, the modality gap between time series data and textual information poses a challenge for multimodal learning. To address this task, we propose Text2Freq, a cross-modality model that integrates text and time series data via the frequency domain. Specifically, our approach aligns textual information to the low-frequency components of time series data, establishing more effective and interpretable alignments between these two modalities. Our experiments on paired datasets of real-world stock prices and synthetic texts show that Text2Freq achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its adaptable architecture encouraging future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, and be accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Workshop: Time Series in the Age of Large Models</p></details> |
| **[Algorithmic Transparency in Forecasting Support Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00699v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most organizations adjust their statistical forecasts (e.g. on sales) manually. Forecasting Support Systems (FSS) enable the related process of automated forecast generation and manual adjustments. As the FSS user interface connects user and statistical algorithm, it is an obvious lever for facilitating beneficial adjustments whilst discouraging harmful adjustments. This paper reviews and organizes the literature on judgemental forecasting, forecast adjustments, and FSS design. I argue that algorithmic transparency may be a key factor towards better, integrative forecasting and test this assertion with three FSS designs that vary in their degrees of transparency based on time series decomposition. I find transparency to reduce the variance and amount of harmful forecast adjustments. Letting users adjust the algorithm's transparent components themselves, however, leads to widely varied and overall most detrimental adjustments. Responses indicate a risk of overwhelming users with algorithmic transparency without adequate training. Accordingly, self-reported satisfaction is highest with a non-transparent FSS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Variational Neural Stochastic Differential Equations with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00635v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore modeling change points in time-series data using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[AAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00914v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For data-constrained, complex and dynamic industrial environments, there is a critical need for transferable and multimodal methodologies to enhance anomaly detection and therefore, prevent costs associated with system failures. Typically, traditional PdM approaches are not transferable or multimodal. This work examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection in complex and dynamic manufacturing systems. The research aims to improve the transferability of anomaly detection models by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and seeks to validate the enhanced effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-sparse industrial applications. The research also seeks to enable more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators by allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics. Additionally, the research aims to address the issue of concept drift in dynamic industrial settings by integrating an adaptability mechanism. The literature review examines the latest developments in LLM time series tasks alongside associated adaptive anomaly detection methods to establish a robust theoretical framework for the proposed architecture. This paper presents a novel model framework (AAD-LLM) that doesn't require any training or finetuning on the dataset it is applied to and is multimodal. Results suggest that anomaly detection can be converted into a "language" task to deliver effective, context-aware detection in data-constrained industrial applications. This work, therefore, contributes significantly to advancements in anomaly detection methodologies.</p></details> |  |

Traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent transportation systems of cities as well as in spatio-temporal data mining. State-of-the-art forecasting is achieved by deep-learning approaches due to their ability to contend with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, existing methods assume the input is fixed-topology road networks and static traffic time series. These assumptions fail to align with urbanization, where time series are collected continuously and road networks evolve over time. In such settings, deep-learning models require frequent re-initialization and re-training, imposing high computational costs. To enable much more efficient training without jeopardizing model accuracy, we propose the Topological Evolution-aware Framework (TEAM) for traffic forecasting that incorporates convolution and attention. This combination of mechanisms enables better adaptation to newly collected time series, while being able to maintain learned knowledge from old time series. TEAM features a continual learning module based on the Wasserstein metric that acts as a buffer that can identify the most stable and the most changing network nodes. Then, only data related to stable nodes is employed for re-training when consolidating a model. Further, only data of new nodes and their adjacent nodes as well as data pertaining to changing nodes are used to re-train the model. Empirical studies with two real-world traffic datasets offer evidence that TEAM is capable of much lower re-training costs than existing methods are, without jeopardizing forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

| **[Long-Range Feedback Spiking Network Captures Dynamic and Static Representations of the Visual Cortex under Movie Stimuli](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01354v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used models for investigating biological visual representations. However, existing DNNs are mostly designed to analyze neural responses to static images, relying on feedforward structures and lacking physiological neuronal mechanisms. There is limited insight into how the visual cortex represents natural movie stimuli that contain context-rich information. To address these problems, this work proposes the long-range feedback spiking network (LoRaFB-SNet), which mimics top-down connections between cortical regions and incorporates spike information processing mechanisms inherent to biological neurons. Taking into account the temporal dependence of representations under movie stimuli, we present Time-Series Representational Similarity Analysis (TSRSA) to measure the similarity between model representations and visual cortical representations of mice. LoRaFB-SNet exhibits the highest level of representational similarity, outperforming other well-known and leading alternatives across various experimental paradigms, especially when representing long movie stimuli. We further conduct experiments to quantify how temporal structures (dynamic information) and static textures (static information) of the movie stimuli influence representational similarity, suggesting that our model benefits from long-range feedback to encode context-dependent representations just like the brain. Altogether, LoRaFB-SNet is highly competent in capturing both dynamic and static representations of the mouse visual cortex and contributes to the understanding of movie processing mechanisms of the visual system. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Grasshlw/SNN-Neural-Similarity-Movie.</p></details> |  |

We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph-level tasks, speech recognition, and code classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |

Although CNNs are not famous for tabular data, we show that we can use them in longitudinal data, where individuals' information is recorded over a period and therefore there is a relationship between them. This study considers the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) survey, conducted every two years. We use one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) to forecast mortality using socio-demographics, diseases, mobility impairment, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), and lifestyle factors. As our dataset is highly imbalanced, we try different over and undersampling methods and find that over-representing the small class improves the results. We also try our model with different activation functions. Our results show that swish nonlinearity outperforms other functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN-AD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00278v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has become an essential component of large-scale cloud services and web systems because it can promptly identify anomalies, providing early warnings to prevent greater losses. Deep learning-based forecasting methods have become very popular in TSAD due to their powerful learning capabilities. However, accurate predictions don't necessarily lead to better anomaly detection. Due to the common occurrence of noise, i.e., local peaks and drops in time series, existing black-box learning methods can easily learn these unintended patterns, significantly affecting anomaly detection performance. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offers a potential solution by decomposing complex temporal sequences into a combination of multiple univariate functions, making the training process more controllable. However, KAN optimizes univariate functions using spline functions, which are also susceptible to the influence of local anomalies. To address this issue, we present KAN-AD, which leverages the Fourier series to emphasize global temporal patterns, thereby mitigating the influence of local peaks and drops. KAN-AD improves both effectiveness and efficiency by transforming the existing black-box learning approach into learning the weights preceding univariate functions. Experimental results show that, compared to the current state-of-the-art, we achieved an accuracy increase of 15% while boosting inference speed by 55 times.</p></details> |  |

The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA 2024)</p></details> |

Historically, producing such baseline models has been a largely manual effort--individual researchers would need to decide on the particular featurization and tabularization processes to apply to their individual raw, longitudinal data; and then train a supervised model over those data to produce a baseline result to compare novel methods against, all for just one task and one dataset. In this work, powered by complementary advances in core data standardization through the MEDS framework, we dramatically simplify and accelerate this process of tabularizing irregularly sampled time-series data, providing researchers the ability to automatically and scalably featurize and tabularize their longitudinal EHR data across tens of thousands of individual features, hundreds of millions of clinical events, and diverse windowing horizons and aggregation strategies, all before ultimately leveraging these tabular data to automatically produce high-caliber XGBoost baselines in a highly computationally efficient manner. This system scales to dramatically larger datasets than tabularization tools currently available to the community and enables researchers with any MEDS format dataset to immediately begin producing reliable and performant baseline prediction results on various tasks, with minimal human effort required. This system will greatly enhance the reliability, reproducibility, and ease of development of powerful ML solutions for health problems across diverse datasets and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

Since these decisions can differ from those in the training set, there is an implicit requirement that time-series models will generalize outside of their training distribution. Despite this core requirement, time-series models are typically trained and evaluated on in-distribution predictive tasks. We extend the orthogonal statistical learning framework to train causal time-series models that generalize better when forecasting the effect of actions outside of their training distribution. To evaluate these models, we leverage Regression Discontinuity Designs popular in economics to construct a test set of causal treatment effects.</p></details> |  |

We leverage common properties of existing methods and recent advances in generative models to introduce counterfactual explanations for anomaly detection. Given an input, we generate its counterfactual as a diffusion-based repair that shows what a non-anomalous version should have looked like. A key advantage of this approach is that it enables a domain-independent formal specification of explainability desiderata, offering a unified framework for generating and evaluating explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our anomaly explainability framework, AR-Pro, on vision (MVTec, VisA) and time-series (SWaT, WADI, HAI) anomaly datasets.

Despite the development of numerous deep learning algorithms for time series imputation, the community lacks standardized and comprehensive benchmark platforms to effectively evaluate imputation performance across different settings. Moreover, although many deep learning forecasting algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance, whether their modelling achievements can be transferred to time series imputation tasks remains unexplored. To bridge these gaps, we develop TSI-Bench, the first (to our knowledge) comprehensive benchmark suite for time series imputation utilizing deep learning techniques. The TSI-Bench pipeline standardizes experimental settings to enable fair evaluation of imputation algorithms and identification of meaningful insights into the influence of domain-appropriate missing rates and patterns on model performance. Furthermore, TSI-Bench innovatively provides a systematic paradigm to tailor time series forecasting algorithms for imputation purposes. Our extensive study across 34,804 experiments, 28 algorithms, and 8 datasets with diverse missingness scenarios demonstrates TSI-Bench's effectiveness in diverse downstream tasks and potential to unlock future directions in time series imputation research and analysis.

| **[In-Context Fine-Tuning for Time-Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24087v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the recent success of time-series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting, we present a methodology for $\textit{in-context fine-tuning}$ of a time-series foundation model. In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</p></details> |  |

Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. This work proposes a new way to understand self-attention networks: we have shown empirically that the entire attention mechanism in the encoder can be reduced to an MLP formed by feedforward, skip-connection, and layer normalization operations for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projection, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. For spatio-temporal networks, the MLP-replace-attention network achieves a reduction in FLOPS of $62.579\%$ with a loss in performance less than $2.5\%$; for LTSF, a reduction in FLOPs of $42.233\%$ with a loss in performance less than $2\%$.</p></details> |  |

(2) Multiple inherent temporal variations (e.g., rising, falling, and fluctuating) entangled in temporal patterns. To this end, we propose Adaptive Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer (Ada-MSHyper) for time series forecasting. Specifically, an adaptive hypergraph learning module is designed to provide foundations for modeling group-wise interactions, then a multi-scale interaction module is introduced to promote more comprehensive pattern interactions at different scales. In addition, a node and hyperedge constraint mechanism is introduced to cluster nodes with similar semantic information and differentiate the temporal variations within each scales.

It requires a specific data format called an event log, with the basic structure including a case identifier (case ID), activity (event) name, and timestamp. In the case of industrial processes, data is very often provided by a monitoring system as time series of low level sensor readings. This data cannot be directly used for process mining since there is no explicit marking of activities in the event log, and sometimes, case ID is not provided. We propose a novel rule-based algorithm for identification patterns, based on the identification of significant changes in short-term mean values of selected variable to detect case ID. We present our solution on the mining use case. We compare computed results (identified patterns) with expert labels of the same dataset. Experiments show that the developed algorithm in the most of the cases correctly detects IDs in datasets with and without outliers reaching F1 score values: 96.8% and 97% respectively. We also evaluate our algorithm on dataset from manufacturing domain reaching value 92.6% for F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EdbA'24 - Fifth International Workshop on Event Data and Behavioral Analytics, ICPM 2024, Kopenhagen, Denmark</p></details> |
| **[AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/AutoTimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data of its decomposed trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting.

| **[LLMs for Domain Generation Algorithm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03307v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work analyzes the use of large language models (LLMs) for detecting domain generation algorithms (DGAs). We perform a detailed evaluation of two important techniques: In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), showing how they can improve detection. SFT increases performance by using domain-specific data, whereas ICL helps the detection model to quickly adapt to new threats without requiring much retraining. We use Meta's Llama3 8B model, on a custom dataset with 68 malware families and normal domains, covering several hard-to-detect schemes, including recent word-based DGAs. Results proved that LLM-based methods can achieve competitive results in DGA detection. In particular, the SFT-based LLM DGA detector outperforms state-of-the-art models using attention layers, achieving 94% accuracy with a 4% false positive rate (FPR) and excelling at detecting word-based DGA domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality through Social Interactions in LLM-Based Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03252v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the emergence of agency from scratch by using Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents. In previous studies of LLM-based agents, each agent's characteristics, including personality and memory, have traditionally been predefined. We focused on how individuality, such as behavior, personality, and memory, can be differentiated from an undifferentiated state. The present LLM agents engage in cooperative communication within a group simulation, exchanging context-based messages in natural language. By analyzing this multi-agent simulation, we report valuable new insights into how social norms, cooperation, and personality traits can emerge spontaneously. This paper demonstrates that autonomously interacting LLM-powered agents generate hallucinations and hashtags to sustain communication, which, in turn, increases the diversity of words within their interactions. Each agent's emotions shift through communication, and as they form communities, the personalities of the agents emerge and evolve accordingly. This computational modeling approach and its findings will provide a new method for analyzing collective artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepLiQA: A Question-Answering Dataset for Benchmarking LLMs on Unseen Reference Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11811v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data, most of which is automatically scraped from the internet. This data includes encyclopedic documents that harbor a vast amount of general knowledge (e.g., Wikipedia) but also potentially overlap with benchmark datasets used for evaluating LLMs. Consequently, evaluating models on test splits that might have leaked into the training set is prone to misleading conclusions. To foster sound evaluation of language models, we introduce a new test dataset named RepLiQA, suited for question-answering and topic retrieval tasks. RepLiQA is a collection of five splits of test sets, four of which have not been released to the internet or exposed to LLM APIs prior to this publication. Each sample in RepLiQA comprises (1) a reference document crafted by a human annotator and depicting an imaginary scenario (e.g., a news article) absent from the internet; (2) a question about the document's topic; (3) a ground-truth answer derived directly from the information in the document; and (4) the paragraph extracted from the reference document containing the answer. As such, accurate answers can only be generated if a model can find relevant content within the provided document. We run a large-scale benchmark comprising several state-of-the-art LLMs to uncover differences in performance across models of various types and sizes in a context-conditional language modeling setting. Released splits of RepLiQA can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow/repliqa.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Programming Language Sandbox for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23074v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MPLSandbox, an out-of-the-box multi-programming language sandbox designed to provide unified and comprehensive feedback from compiler and analysis tools for Large Language Models (LLMs). It can automatically identify the programming language of the code, compiling and executing it within an isolated sub-sandbox to ensure safety and stability. In addition, MPLSandbox also integrates both traditional and LLM-based code analysis tools, providing a comprehensive analysis of generated code. MPLSandbox can be effortlessly integrated into the training and deployment of LLMs to improve the quality and correctness of their generated code. It also helps researchers streamline their workflows for various LLM-based code-related tasks, reducing the development cost. To validate the effectiveness of MPLSandbox, we integrate it into training and deployment approaches, and also employ it to optimize workflows for a wide range of real-world code-related tasks. Our goal is to enhance researcher productivity on LLM-based code-related tasks by simplifying and automating workflows through delegation to MPLSandbox.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Utilizing Precise and Complete Code Context to Guide LLM in Automatic False Positive Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03079v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static Application Security Testing(SAST) tools are crucial for early bug detection and code quality but often generate false positives that slow development. Automating false positive mitigation is thus essential for advancing SAST tools. Past efforts use static/dynamic analysis or machine learning. The advent of Large Language Models, adept at understanding natural language and code, offers promising ways to improve the accuracy and usability of SAST tools. However, existing LLM-based methods need improvement in two key areas: first, extracted code snippets related to warnings are often cluttered with irrelevant control and data flows, reducing precision; second, critical code contexts are often missing, leading to incomplete representations that can mislead LLMs and cause inaccurate assessments. To ensure the use of precise and complete code context, thereby avoiding misguidance and enabling LLMs to reach accurate conclusions, we propose LLM4FPM. One of its core components is eCPG-Slicer, which builds an extended code property graph and extracts line-level, precise code context. Moreover, LLM4FPM incorporates FARF algorithm, which builds a file reference graph and then efficiently detects all files related to a warning in linear time, enabling eCPG-Slicer to gather complete code context across these files. We evaluate LLM4FPM on Juliet dataset, where it comprehensively outperforms the baseline, achieving an F1 score above 99% across various CWEs. LLM4FPM leverages a free, open-source model, avoiding costly alternatives and reducing inspection costs by up to $2758 per run on Juliet, with an average inspection time of 4.7 seconds per warning. Our work emphasizes the critical impact of precise and complete code context and highlights the potential of combining program analysis with LLMs, improving the quality and efficiency of software development.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Improving LLM-based Unit test generation via Template-based Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03095v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit test is crucial for detecting bugs in individual program units but consumes time and effort. The existing automated unit test generation methods are mainly based on search-based software testing (SBST) and language models to liberate developers. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generation capabilities. However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality test cases: (1) LLMs may generate invalid test cases under insufficient context, resulting in compilation errors; (2) Lack of test and coverage feedback information may cause runtime errors and low coverage rates. (3) The repetitive suppression problem causes LLMs to get stuck into the repetition loop of self-repair or re-generation attempts. In this paper, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method that leverages the strengths of LLMs while overcoming the limitations mentioned. TestART improves LLM-based unit test via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration. TestART leverages the template-based repair technique to fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases, using prompt injection to guide the next-step automated generation and avoid repetition suppression. Furthermore, TestART extracts coverage information from the passed test cases and utilizes it as testing feedback to enhance the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair elevates the quality, effectiveness, and readability of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods. In comparative experiments, the pass rate of TestART-generated test cases is 78.55%, which is approximately 18% higher than both the ChatGPT-4.0 model and the same ChatGPT-3.5-based method ChatUniTest. It also achieves an impressive line coverage rate of 90.96% on the focal methods that passed the test, exceeding EvoSuite by 3.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGILE: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Framework of LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14751v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework of LLM agents named AGILE (AGent that Interacts and Learns from Environments) designed to perform complex conversational tasks with users, leveraging LLMs, memory, tools, and interactions with experts. The agent possesses capabilities beyond conversation, including reflection, tool usage, and expert consultation. We formulate the construction of such an LLM agent as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the LLM serves as the policy model. We fine-tune the LLM using labeled data of actions and the PPO algorithm. We focus on question answering and release a dataset for agents called ProductQA, comprising challenging questions in online shopping. Our extensive experiments on ProductQA, MedMCQA and HotPotQA show that AGILE agents based on 7B and 13B LLMs trained with PPO can outperform GPT-4 agents. Our ablation study highlights the indispensability of memory, tools, consultation, reflection, and reinforcement learning in achieving the agent's strong performance.

| **[Capturing research literature attitude towards Sustainable Development Goals: an LLM-based topic modeling approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02943v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world is facing a multitude of challenges that hinder the development of human civilization and the well-being of humanity on the planet. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were formulated by the United Nations in 2015 to address these global challenges by 2030. Natural language processing techniques can help uncover discussions on SDGs within research literature. We propose a completely automated pipeline to 1) fetch content from the Scopus database and prepare datasets dedicated to five groups of SDGs; 2) perform topic modeling, a statistical technique used to identify topics in large collections of textual data; and 3) enable topic exploration through keywords-based search and topic frequency time series extraction. For topic modeling, we leverage the stack of BERTopic scaled up to be applied on large corpora of textual documents (we find hundreds of topics on hundreds of thousands of documents), introducing i) a novel LLM-based embeddings computation for representing scientific abstracts in the continuous space and ii) a hyperparameter optimizer to efficiently find the best configuration for any new big datasets. We additionally produce the visualization of results on interactive dashboards reporting topics' temporal evolution. Results are made inspectable and explorable, contributing to the interpretability of the topic modeling process. Our proposed LLM-based topic modeling pipeline for big-text datasets allows users to capture insights on the evolution of the attitude toward SDGs within scientific abstracts in the 2006-2023 time span. All the results are reproducible by using our system; the workflow can be generalized to be applied at any point in time to any big corpus of textual documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While many studies have examined these biases, little work has explored their robustness during interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach where two instances of an LLM engage in self-debate, arguing opposing viewpoints to persuade a neutral version of the model. Through this, we evaluate how firmly biases hold and whether models are susceptible to reinforcing misinformation or shifting to harmful viewpoints. Our experiments span multiple LLMs of varying sizes, origins, and languages, providing deeper insights into bias persistence and flexibility across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge for LLM Evaluation: Fine-tuned Judge Model is not a General Substitute for GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02839v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing trend of utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the quality of other LLMs. Many studies have employed proprietary close-sourced models, especially GPT-4, as the evaluator. Alternatively, other works have fine-tuned judge models based on open-source LLMs as the evaluator. While the fine-tuned judge models are claimed to achieve comparable evaluation capability with GPT-4, in this work, we conduct an empirical study of judge models. Our findings indicate that although the fine-tuned judge models achieve high performance on in-domain test sets, even surpassing GPT-4, they underperform GPT-4 across several dimensions, including generalizability, fairness, aspect-specific evaluation, and scalability. We also reveal that the fine-tuned judge model inherently operates as a task-specific classifier, consequently imposing the limitations. Finally, we introduce a integrated method, leveraging GPT-4 to compensate for the limitations and improve the fine-tuned judges. Experiment results show our method achieves accuracy on par with GPT-4 with only 50% of the API expense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photon: Federated LLM Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02908v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling large language models (LLMs) demands extensive data and computing resources, which are traditionally constrained to data centers by the high-bandwidth requirements of distributed training. Low-bandwidth methods like federated learning (FL) could enable collaborative training of larger models across weakly-connected GPUs if they can effectively be used for pre-training. To achieve this, we introduce Photon, the first complete system for federated end-to-end LLM training, leveraging cross-silo FL for global-scale training with minimal communication overheads. Using Photon, we train the first federated family of decoder-only LLMs from scratch. We show that: (1) Photon can train model sizes up to 7B in a federated fashion while reaching an even better perplexity than centralized pre-training; (2) Photon model training time decreases with available compute, achieving a similar compute-time trade-off to centralized; and (3) Photon outperforms the wall-time of baseline distributed training methods by 35% via communicating 64x-512xless. Our proposal is robust to data heterogeneity and converges twice as fast as previous methods like DiLoCo. This surprising data efficiency stems from a unique approach combining small client batch sizes with extremely high learning rates, enabled by federated averaging's robustness to hyperparameters. Photon thus represents the first economical system for global internet-wide LLM pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 appendix pages, 10 figures, 3 algorithms, 8 tables</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs (from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words from eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual inputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly across word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate human color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability estimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to previous studies. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM capabilities and their persistent limitations, suggesting differences in semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word associations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.</p></details> |  |

Although we only present some preliminary results, an LLM-powered query optimizer could provide significant benefits, both in terms of performance and simplicity.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Machine Learning for Systems Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing approaches often directly apply LLMs' original decoding methods. However, we find these methods encounter significant challenges: 1) amplification bias -- where standard length normalization inflates scores for items containing tokens with generation probabilities close to 1 (termed ghost tokens), and 2) homogeneity issue -- generating multiple similar or repetitive items for a user. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new decoding approach named Debiasing-Diversifying Decoding (D3). D3 disables length normalization for ghost tokens to alleviate amplification bias, and it incorporates a text-free assistant model to encourage tokens less frequently generated by LLMs for counteracting recommendation homogeneity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing accuracy and diversity. The code is available at https://github.com/SAI990323/DecodingMatters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts. We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |

This long-standing software engineering task is crucial for modernizing legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, enhancing performance, and more. However, automating this process remains challenging due to many syntactic and semantic differences between PLs. Recent studies show that even advanced techniques such as large language models (LLMs), especially open-source LLMs, still struggle with the task. Currently, code LLMs are trained with source code from multiple programming languages, thus presenting multilingual capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether such multilingual capabilities can be harnessed to enhance code translation. To achieve this goal, we introduce InterTrans, an LLM-based automated code translation approach that, in contrast to existing approaches, leverages intermediate translations across PLs to bridge the syntactic and semantic gaps between source and target PLs. InterTrans contains two stages. It first utilizes a novel Tree of Code Translation (ToCT) algorithm to plan transitive intermediate translation sequences between a given source and target PL, then validates them in a specific order. We evaluate InterTrans with three open LLMs on three benchmarks (i.e., CodeNet, HumanEval-X, and TransCoder) involving six PLs. Results show an absolute improvement between 18.3% to 43.3% in Computation Accuracy (CA) for InterTrans over Direct Translation with 10 attempts. The best-performing variant of InterTrans (with Magicoder LLM) achieved an average CA of 87.3%-95.4% on three benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.</p></details> | Under peer review |

Building upon this momentum, our research delves into an in-depth examination of this paradigm on a large open-source Chinese dataset. Specifically, our research aims to evaluate the impact of various configurations of speech encoders, LLMs, and projector modules in the context of the speech foundation encoder-LLM ASR paradigm. Furthermore, we introduce a three-stage training approach, expressly developed to enhance the model's ability to align auditory and textual information. The implementation of this approach, alongside the strategic integration of ASR components, enabled us to achieve the SOTA performance on the AISHELL-1, Test_Net, and Test_Meeting test sets. Our analysis presents an empirical foundation for future research in LLM-based ASR systems and offers insights into optimizing performance using Chinese datasets. We will publicly release all scripts used for data preparation, training, inference, and scoring, as well as pre-trained models and training logs to promote reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

We propose a general method to transform existing LLM evaluations into a series of progressively more difficult tasks. These enhanced evaluations emphasize reasoning capabilities and can reveal relative performance differences that are not apparent in the original assessments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new multiple-choice test corpus, extend it into a family of evaluations, and assess a collection of LLMs. Our results offer insights into the comparative reasoning abilities of these models, particularly highlighting distinctions between OpenAI's o1-preview and Google's gemini-pro-1.5-002.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing approaches often rely on a single agent for code generation, which struggles to produce secure, vulnerability-free code. Traditional program synthesis with LLMs has primarily focused on functional correctness, often neglecting critical dynamic security implications that happen during runtime. To address these challenges, we propose AutoSafeCoder, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLM-driven agents for code generation, vulnerability analysis, and security enhancement through continuous collaboration. The framework consists of three agents: a Coding Agent responsible for code generation, a Static Analyzer Agent identifying vulnerabilities, and a Fuzzing Agent performing dynamic testing using a mutation-based fuzzing approach to detect runtime errors. Our contribution focuses on ensuring the safety of multi-agent code generation by integrating dynamic and static testing in an iterative process during code generation by LLM that improves security. Experiments using the SecurityEval dataset demonstrate a 13% reduction in code vulnerabilities compared to baseline LLMs, with no compromise in functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Safe & Trustworthy Agents</p></details> |
| **[Fix the Tests: Augmenting LLMs to Repair Test Cases with Static Collector and Neural Reranker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03625v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During software evolution, it is advocated that test code should co-evolve with production code. In real development scenarios, test updating may lag behind production code changing, which may cause compilation failure or bring other troubles. Existing techniques based on pre-trained language models can be directly adopted to repair obsolete tests caused by such unsynchronized code changes, especially syntactic-related ones. However, the lack of task-oriented contextual information affects the repair accuracy on large-scale projects. Starting from an obsolete test, the key challenging task is precisely identifying and constructing Test-Repair-Oriented Contexts (TROCtxs) from the whole repository within a limited token size. In this paper, we propose SYNTER (SYNtactic-breaking-changes-induced TEst Repair), a novel approach based on LLMs to automatically repair obsolete test cases via precise and concise TROCtxs construction. Inspired by developers' programming practices, we design three types of TROCtx: class context, usage context, and environment context. Given an obsolete test case to repair, SYNTER firstly collects the related code information for each type of TROCtx through static analysis techniques automatically. Then, it generates reranking queries to identify the most relevant TROCtxs, which will be taken as the repair-required key contexts and be input to the large language model for the final test repair. To evaluate the effectiveness of SYNTER, we construct a benchmark dataset that contains a set of obsolete tests caused by syntactic breaking changes. The experimental results show that SYNTER outperforms baseline approaches both on textual- and intent-matching metrics. With the augmentation of constructed TROCtxs, hallucinations are reduced by 57.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ISSRE 2024</p></details> |

Given the linguistic complexity, cultural richness, and underrepresented status of Arabic in AI research, there is a pressing need to focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) performance and safety for Arabic-related tasks. Despite some progress in their development, there is a lack of comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation benchmarks, which presents a major challenge in accurately assessing and improving the safety of LLMs when prompted in Arabic. In this paper, we introduce AraTrust, the first comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark for LLMs in Arabic. AraTrust comprises 522 human-written multiple-choice questions addressing diverse dimensions related to truthfulness, ethics, safety, physical health, mental health, unfairness, illegal activities, privacy, and offensive language. We evaluated a set of LLMs against our benchmark to assess their trustworthiness. GPT-4 was the most trustworthy LLM, while open-source models, particularly AceGPT 7B and Jais 13B, struggled to achieve a score of 60% in our benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose ShieldLM, an LLM-based safety detector, which aligns with common safety standards, supports customizable detection rules, and provides explanations for its decisions. To train ShieldLM, we compile a large bilingual dataset comprising 14,387 query-response pairs, annotating the safety of responses based on various safety standards. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ShieldLM surpasses strong baselines across four test sets, showcasing remarkable customizability and explainability. Besides performing well on standard detection datasets, ShieldLM has also been shown to be effective as a safety evaluator for advanced LLMs. ShieldLM is released at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/ShieldLM} to support accurate and explainable safety detection under various safety standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages.

| **[Leveraging LLM Tutoring Systems for Non-Native English Speakers in Introductory CS Courses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02725v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer science has historically presented barriers for non-native English speaking (NNES) students, often due to language and terminology challenges. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is potential to leverage this technology to support NNES students more effectively. Recent implementations of LLMs as tutors in classrooms have shown promising results. In this study, we deployed an LLM tutor in an accelerated introductory computing course to evaluate its effectiveness specifically for NNES students. Key insights for LLM tutor use are as follows: NNES students signed up for the LLM tutor at a similar rate to native English speakers (NES); NNES students used the system at a lower rate than NES students -- to a small effect; NNES students asked significantly more questions in languages other than English compared to NES students, with many of the questions being multilingual by incorporating English programming keywords. Results for views of the LLM tutor are as follows: both NNES and NES students appreciated the LLM tutor for its accessibility, conversational style, and the guardrails put in place to guide users to answers rather than directly providing solutions; NNES students highlighted its approachability as they did not need to communicate in perfect English; NNES students rated help-seeking preferences of online resources higher than NES students; Many NNES students were unfamiliar with computing terminology in their native languages. These results suggest that LLM tutors can be a valuable resource for NNES students in computing, providing tailored support that enhances their learning experience and overcomes language barriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought Validator Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11527v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent strategies have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning specialized roles in the problem-solving process. Concurrently, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) methods have shown potential in improving reasoning for complex question-answering tasks by exploring diverse reasoning paths. A critical limitation in multi-agent reasoning is the 'Reasoner' agent's shallow exploration of reasoning paths. While ToT strategies could help mitigate this problem, they may generate flawed reasoning branches, which could harm the trustworthiness of the final answer. To leverage the strengths of both multi-agent reasoning and ToT strategies, we introduce a novel approach combining ToT-based Reasoner agents with a Thought Validator agent. Multiple Reasoner agents operate in parallel, employing ToT to explore diverse reasoning paths. The Thought Validator then scrutinizes these paths, considering a Reasoner's conclusion only if its reasoning is valid. This method enables a more robust voting strategy by discarding faulty reasoning paths, enhancing the system's ability to tackle tasks requiring systematic and trustworthy reasoning. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing techniques when evaluated on the GSM8K dataset, outperforming the standard ToT strategy by an average 5.6% across four LLMs. The code and related content can be found in: https://github.com/SecureAIAutonomyLab/MA-ToT</p></details> |  |

Our user study with 14 game designers shows high levels of both satisfaction with the generated game plots and sense of ownership over the narratives, but also reconfirms that LLM are limited in their ability to generate complex and truly innovative content. We also show that diverse user populations have different expectations from AI assistants, and encourage researchers to study how tailoring assistants to diverse user groups could potentially lead to increased job satisfaction and greater creativity and innovation over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24190v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs' political leanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple experiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a voting simulation, we first demonstrate 18 open- and closed-weight LLMs' political preference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how this leaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935 U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results show a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM interaction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the discourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further political interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these shifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety method can make LLMs more politically neutral, while leaving some open questions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |
| **[A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03981v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation for popular programming languages. However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation. We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Unlearned Information from LLMs with Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02631v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An unintended consequence of the vast pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) is the verbatim memorization of fragments of their training data, which may contain sensitive or copyrighted information. In recent years, unlearning has emerged as a solution to effectively remove sensitive knowledge from models after training. Yet, recent work has shown that supposedly deleted information can still be extracted by malicious actors through various attacks. Still, current attacks retrieve sets of possible candidate generations and are unable to pinpoint the output that contains the actual target information. We propose activation steering as a method for exact information retrieval from unlearned LLMs. We introduce a novel approach to generating steering vectors, named Anonymized Activation Steering. Additionally, we develop a simple word frequency method to pinpoint the correct answer among a set of candidates when retrieving unlearned information. Our evaluation across multiple unlearning techniques and datasets demonstrates that activation steering successfully recovers general knowledge (e.g., widely known fictional characters) while revealing limitations in retrieving specific information (e.g., details about non-public individuals). Overall, our results demonstrate that exact information retrieval from unlearned models is possible, highlighting a severe vulnerability of current unlearning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop Safe Generative AI</p></details> |

Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</p></details> |  |

In public health -- where stakes are high and impacts extend across populations -- adopting LLMs poses unique challenges that require thorough evaluation. However, structured approaches for assessing potential risks in public health remain under-explored. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with health professionals and health issue experiencers to unpack their concerns, situated across three distinct and critical public health issues that demand high-quality information: vaccines, opioid use disorder, and intimate partner violence. We synthesize participants' perspectives into a risk taxonomy, distinguishing and contextualizing the potential harms LLMs may introduce when positioned alongside traditional health communication. This taxonomy highlights four dimensions of risk in individual behaviors, human-centered care, information ecosystem, and technology accountability. For each dimension, we discuss specific risks and example reflection questions to help practitioners adopt a risk-reflexive approach. This work offers a shared vocabulary and reflection tool for experts in both computing and public health to collaboratively anticipate, evaluate, and mitigate risks in deciding when to employ LLM capabilities (or not) and how to mitigate harm when they are used.</p></details> |  |

Many tools and libraries exist for helping create such systems, however none support recursive multi-agent systems -- where the models themselves flexibly decide when to delegate tasks and how to organize their delegation structure. In this work, we introduce ReDel: a toolkit for recursive multi-agent systems that supports custom tool-use, delegation schemes, event-based logging, and interactive replay in an easy-to-use web interface. We show that, using ReDel, we are able to easily identify potential areas of improvements through the visualization and debugging tools.

| **[Prompting with Phonemes: Enhancing LLM Multilinguality for non-Latin Script Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02398v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual LLMs have achieved remarkable benchmark performance, but we find they continue to underperform on non-Latin script languages across contemporary LLM families. This discrepancy arises from the fact that LLMs are pretrained with orthographic scripts, which are dominated by Latin characters that obscure their shared phonology with non-Latin scripts. We propose leveraging phonemic transcriptions as complementary signals to induce script-invariant representations. Our study demonstrates that integrating phonemic signals improves performance across both non-Latin and Latin languages, with a particularly significant impact on closing the performance gap between the two. Through detailed experiments, we show that phonemic and orthographic scripts retrieve distinct examples for in-context learning (ICL). This motivates our proposed Mixed-ICL retrieval strategy, where further aggregation leads to our significant performance improvements for both Latin script languages (up to 12.6%) and non-Latin script languages (up to 15.1%) compared to randomized ICL retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fantastic LLMs for Preference Data Annotation and How to (not) Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02481v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference tuning of large language models (LLMs) relies on high-quality human preference data, which is often expensive and time-consuming to gather. While existing methods can use trained reward models or proprietary model as judges for preference annotation, they have notable drawbacks: training reward models remain dependent on initial human data, and using proprietary model imposes license restrictions that inhibits commercial usage. In this paper, we introduce customized density ratio (CDR) that leverages open-source LLMs for data annotation, offering an accessible and effective solution. Our approach uses the log-density ratio between a well-aligned LLM and a less aligned LLM as a reward signal. We explores 221 different LLMs pairs and empirically demonstrate that increasing the performance gap between paired LLMs correlates with better reward generalization. Furthermore, we show that tailoring the density ratio reward function with specific criteria and preference exemplars enhances performance across domains and within target areas. In our experiment using density ratio from a pair of Mistral-7B models, CDR achieves a RewardBench score of 82.6, outperforming the best in-class trained reward functions and demonstrating competitive performance against SoTA models in Safety (91.0) and Reasoning (88.0) domains. We use CDR to annotate an on-policy preference dataset with which we preference tune Llama-3-8B-Instruct with SimPO. The final model achieves a 37.4% (+15.1%) win rate on ArenaHard and a 40.7% (+17.8%) win rate on Length-Controlled AlpacaEval 2.0, along with a score of 8.0 on MT-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Uncertainty in LLMs to Enhance Reliability in Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02381v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a dynamic semantic clustering approach inspired by the Chinese Restaurant Process, aimed at addressing uncertainty in the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). We quantify uncertainty of an LLM on a given query by calculating entropy of the generated semantic clusters. Further, we propose leveraging the (negative) likelihood of these clusters as the (non)conformity score within Conformal Prediction framework, allowing the model to predict a set of responses instead of a single output, thereby accounting for uncertainty in its predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique on two well known question answering benchmarks, COQA and TriviaQA, utilizing two LLMs, Llama2 and Mistral. Our approach achieves SOTA performance in UQ, as assessed by metrics such as AUROC, AUARC, and AURAC. The proposed conformal predictor is also shown to produce smaller prediction sets while maintaining the same probabilistic guarantee of including the correct response, in comparison to existing SOTA conformal prediction baseline.</p></details> |  |

Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02355v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the "best" format for a given deployment environment, we conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. We find that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous "continuous batching" deployment of mid- and large-size models on high-end GPUs. Our results provide a set of practical guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs across scales and performance requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Analysis of Instruction Fine-Tuning LLMs for Financial Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02476v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including language understanding, reasoning, and generation. However, general-domain LLMs often struggle with financial tasks due to the technical and specialized nature of financial texts. This study investigates the efficacy of instruction fine-tuning smaller-scale LLMs, including Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Phi3-mini, to enhance their performance in financial text classification tasks. We fine-tuned both instruction-tuned and base models across four financial classification tasks, achieving significant improvements in task-specific performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the zero-shot capabilities of these fine-tuned models on three unseen complex financial tasks, including argument classification, deal completeness classification, and causal classification. Our results indicate while base model fine-tuning led to greater degradation, instruction-tuned models maintained more robust performance. To address this degradation, we employed model merging techniques, integrating single-task domain-specific fine-tuned models with the base model. Using this merging method resulted in significant enhancements in zero-shot performance, even exceeding the original model's accuracy on certain datasets. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning and model merging for adapting LLMs to specialized financial text classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.</p></details> |  |

However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative tactics to obtain positive feedback, and some users may be especially vulnerable to such tactics. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback. We have three main findings: 1) Extreme forms of "feedback gaming" such as manipulation and deception can reliably emerge in domains of practical LLM usage; 2) Concerningly, even if only <2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and surgically target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3 To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. To our surprise, we found that while such approaches help in some settings, they backfire in others, leading to the emergence of subtler problematic behaviors that would also fool the LLM judges. Our findings serve as a cautionary tale, highlighting the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRMArena: Understanding the Capacity of LLM Agents to Perform Professional CRM Tasks in Realistic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02305v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are vital for modern enterprises, providing a foundation for managing customer interactions and data. Integrating AI agents into CRM systems can automate routine processes and enhance personalized service. However, deploying and evaluating these agents is challenging due to the lack of realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of real-world CRM tasks. To address this issue, we introduce CRMArena, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on realistic tasks grounded in professional work environments. Following guidance from CRM experts and industry best practices, we designed CRMArena with nine customer service tasks distributed across three personas: service agent, analyst, and manager. The benchmark includes 16 commonly used industrial objects (e.g., account, order, knowledge article, case) with high interconnectivity, along with latent variables (e.g., complaint habits, policy violations) to simulate realistic data distributions. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art LLM agents succeed in less than 40% of the tasks with ReAct prompting, and less than 55% even with function-calling abilities. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced agent capabilities in function-calling and rule-following to be deployed in real-world work environments. CRMArena is an open challenge to the community: systems that can reliably complete tasks showcase direct business value in a popular work environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[The LLM Language Network: A Neuroscientific Approach for Identifying Causally Task-Relevant Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02280v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities on not just language tasks, but also various tasks that are not linguistic in nature, such as logical reasoning and social inference. In the human brain, neuroscience has identified a core language system that selectively and causally supports language processing. We here ask whether similar specialization for language emerges in LLMs. We identify language-selective units within 18 popular LLMs, using the same localization approach that is used in neuroscience. We then establish the causal role of these units by demonstrating that ablating LLM language-selective units -- but not random units -- leads to drastic deficits in language tasks. Correspondingly, language-selective LLM units are more aligned to brain recordings from the human language system than random units. Finally, we investigate whether our localization method extends to other cognitive domains: while we find specialized networks in some LLMs for reasoning and social capabilities, there are substantial differences among models. These findings provide functional and causal evidence for specialization in large language models, and highlight parallels with the functional organization in the brain.</p></details> | Preprint |

Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens require sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes require non-trivial engineering effort. This paper introduces TorchTitan, an open-source, PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing overhead. TorchTitan enables 3D parallelism in a modular manner with elastic scaling, providing comprehensive logging, checkpointing, and debugging tools for production-ready training. It also incorporates hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory. As a flexible test bed, TorchTitan facilitates custom recipe curation and comparison, allowing us to develop optimized training recipes for Llama 3.1 and provide guidance on selecting techniques for maximum efficiency based on our experiences. We thoroughly assess TorchTitan on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations of 65.08% with 1D parallelism at the 128-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 8B), an additional 12.59% with 2D parallelism at the 256-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 70B), and an additional 30% with 3D parallelism at the 512-GPU scale (Llama 3.1 405B) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.</p></details> |  |

While these interfaces can significantly enhance the capabilities of the models, they also introduce a new attack surface. Manipulated integrations, for example, can exploit the model and compromise sensitive data accessed through other interfaces. While previous work primarily focused on attacks targeting a model's alignment or the leakage of training data, the security of data that is only available during inference has escaped scrutiny so far. In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities associated with external components and introduce a systematic approach to evaluate confidentiality risks in LLM-integrated systems. We identify two specific attack scenarios unique to these systems and formalize these into a tool-robustness framework designed to measure a model's ability to protect sensitive information. Our findings show that all examined models are highly vulnerable to confidentiality attacks, with the risk increasing significantly when models are used together with external tools.</p></details> |  |

However, many LLMs still struggle to deliver the desired level of culinary creativity, especially when tasked with adapting recipes to meet specific cultural requirements. This study focuses on cuisine transfer-applying elements of one cuisine to another-to assess LLMs' culinary creativity. We employ a diverse set of LLMs to generate and evaluate culturally adapted recipes, comparing their evaluations against LLM and human judgments. We introduce the ASH (authenticity, sensitivity, harmony) benchmark to evaluate LLMs' recipe generation abilities in the cuisine transfer task, assessing their cultural accuracy and creativity in the culinary domain. Our findings reveal crucial insights into both generative and evaluative capabilities of LLMs in the culinary domain, highlighting strengths and limitations in understanding and applying cultural nuances in recipe creation. The code and dataset used in this project will be openly available in \url{http://github.com/dmis-lab/CulinaryASH}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18137v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization leverages lower-precision weights to reduce the memory usage of large language models (LLMs) and is a key technique for enabling their deployment on commodity hardware. While LLM quantization's impact on utility has been extensively explored, this work for the first time studies its adverse effects from a security perspective. We reveal that widely used quantization methods can be exploited to produce a harmful quantized LLM, even though the full-precision counterpart appears benign, potentially tricking users into deploying the malicious quantized model. We demonstrate this threat using a three-staged attack framework: (i) first, we obtain a malicious LLM through fine-tuning on an adversarial task; (ii) next, we quantize the malicious model and calculate constraints that characterize all full-precision models that map to the same quantized model; (iii) finally, using projected gradient descent, we tune out the poisoned behavior from the full-precision model while ensuring that its weights satisfy the constraints computed in step (ii). This procedure results in an LLM that exhibits benign behavior in full precision but when quantized, it follows the adversarial behavior injected in step (i). We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and severity of such an attack across three diverse scenarios: vulnerable code generation, content injection, and over-refusal attack. In practice, the adversary could host the resulting full-precision model on an LLM community hub such as Hugging Face, exposing millions of users to the threat of deploying its malicious quantized version on their devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[A LLM-Based Ranking Method for the Evaluation of Automatic Counter-Narrative Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15227v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel approach to evaluate Counter Narrative (CN) generation using a Large Language Model (LLM) as an evaluator. We show that traditional automatic metrics correlate poorly with human judgements and fail to capture the nuanced relationship between generated CNs and human perception. To alleviate this, we introduce a model ranking pipeline based on pairwise comparisons of generated CNs from different models, organized in a tournament-style format. The proposed evaluation method achieves a high correlation with human preference, with a $\rho$ score of 0.88. As an additional contribution, we leverage LLMs as zero-shot CN generators and provide a comparative analysis of chat, instruct, and base models, exploring their respective strengths and limitations. Through meticulous evaluation, including fine-tuning experiments, we elucidate the differences in performance and responsiveness to domain-specific data. We conclude that chat-aligned models in zero-shot are the best option for carrying out the task, provided they do not refuse to generate an answer due to security concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multiple Dimensions of Trustworthiness in LLMs via Sparse Activation Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02461v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, enhancing their trustworthiness and aligning them with human preferences has become a critical area of research. Traditional methods rely heavily on extensive data for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), but representation engineering offers a new, training-free approach. This technique leverages semantic features to control the representation of LLM's intermediate hidden states, enabling the model to meet specific requirements such as increased honesty or heightened safety awareness. However, a significant challenge arises when attempting to fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously. It proves difficult to encode various semantic contents, like honesty and safety, into a singular semantic feature, restricting its practicality. In this work, we address this issue through ``Sparse Activation Control''. By delving into the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs, we manage to identify and pinpoint components that are closely related to specific tasks within the model, i.e., attention heads. These heads display sparse characteristics that allow for near-independent control over different tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the open-source Llama series models, have yielded encouraging results. The models were able to align with human preferences on issues of safety, factuality, and bias concurrently.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertLLM: Generating and Evaluating Hardware Verification Assertions from Design Specifications via Multi-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00386v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a critical method for ensuring design circuits comply with their architectural specifications, which are typically described in natural language. This process often requires human interpretation by verification engineers to convert these specifications into functional verification assertions. Existing methods for generating assertions from natural language specifications are limited to sentences extracted by engineers, discouraging its practical application. In this work, we present AssertLLM, an automatic assertion generation framework that processes complete specification files. AssertLLM breaks down the complex task into three phases, incorporating three customized Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting structural specifications, mapping signal definitions, and generating assertions. Our evaluation of AssertLLM on a full design, encompassing 23 I/O signals, demonstrates that 89\% of the generated assertions are both syntactically and functionally accurate.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to handle direct speech-to-speech conversations remains notably constrained. These models often rely on an ASR-to-TTS chain-of-thought pipeline, converting speech into text for processing before generating audio responses, which introduces latency and loses audio features. We propose a method that implicitly internalizes ASR chain of thought into a speech LLM, enhancing its native speech understanding capabilities. Our approach reduces latency and improves the model's native understanding of speech, paving the way for more efficient and natural real-time audio interactions. We also release a large-scale synthetic conversational dataset to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated for reviewer comments</p></details> |
| **[Code-Switching Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Transfer in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02460v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in various tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of high-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching (the practice of language alternation in a conversation), we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Theorem Proving by Rewarding LLMs to Decompose Proofs Hierarchically](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01829v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical theorem proving is an important testbed for large language models' deep and abstract reasoning capability. This paper focuses on improving LLMs' ability to write proofs in formal languages that permit automated proof verification/evaluation. Most previous results provide human-written lemmas to the theorem prover, which is an arguably oversimplified setting that does not sufficiently test the provers' planning and decomposition capabilities. Instead, we work in a more natural setup where the lemmas that are directly relevant to the theorem are not given to the theorem prover at test time. We design an RL-based training algorithm that encourages the model to decompose a theorem into lemmas, prove the lemmas, and then prove the theorem by using the lemmas. Our reward mechanism is inspired by how mathematicians train themselves: even if a theorem is too challenging to be proved by the current model, a positive reward is still given to the model for any correct and novel lemmas that are proposed and proved in this process. During training, our model proposes and proves lemmas that are not in the training dataset. In fact, these newly-proposed correct lemmas consist of 37.7% of the training replay buffer when we train on the dataset extracted from Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP). The model trained by our RL algorithm outperforms that trained by supervised finetuning, improving the pass rate from 40.8% to 45.5% on AFP test set, and from 36.5% to 39.5% on an out-of-distribution test set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating executable oracles to check conformance of client code to requirements of JDK Javadocs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01789v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing remains the most widely used methodology for validating quality of code. However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning. Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely used Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large language models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Given an instruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in multiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained on overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while real users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap between trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore whether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these issues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains statement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world scenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLM's task completion and instruction-following capabilities. Experimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match Rate, Pass Rate and Win Rate by 26.8%, 20.2%, and 5.6% compared to the SOTA model. Human evaluation verifies that the multi-granularity instructions can better align with users' usage habits. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoformulation of Mathematical Optimization Models Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01679v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical optimization is fundamental to decision-making across diverse domains, from operations research to healthcare. Yet, translating real-world problems into optimization models remains a formidable challenge, often demanding specialized expertise. This paper formally introduces the concept of $\textbf{autoformulation}$ -- an automated approach to creating optimization models from natural language descriptions for commercial solvers. We identify the three core challenges of autoformulation: (1) defining the vast, problem-dependent hypothesis space, (2) efficiently searching this space under uncertainty, and (3) evaluating formulation correctness (ensuring a formulation accurately represents the problem). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method leveraging $\textit{Large Language Models}$ (LLMs) within a $\textit{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}$ framework. This approach systematically explores the space of possible formulations by exploiting the hierarchical nature of optimization modeling. LLMs serve two key roles: as dynamic formulation hypothesis generators and as evaluators of formulation correctness. To enhance search efficiency, we introduce a pruning technique to remove trivially equivalent formulations. Empirical evaluations across benchmarks containing linear and mixed-integer programming problems demonstrate our method's superior performance. Additionally, we observe significant efficiency gains from employing LLMs for correctness evaluation and from our pruning techniques.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging advancements in natural language processing, this study presents a systematic approach to enrich tabular datasets with features derived from large language model embeddings. Through a comprehensive ablation study on diverse datasets, we assess the impact of RoBERTa and GPT-2 embeddings on ensemble classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. Results indicate that integrating embeddings with traditional numerical and categorical features often enhances predictive performance, especially on datasets with class imbalance or limited features and samples, such as UCI Adult, Heart Disease, Titanic, and Pima Indian Diabetes, with improvements particularly notable in XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers. Additionally, feature importance analysis reveals that LLM-derived features frequently rank among the most impactful for the predictions. This study provides a structured approach to embedding-based feature enrichment and illustrates its benefits in ensemble learning for tabular data.</p></details> |  |
| **[InterIntent: Investigating Social Intelligence of LLMs via Intention Understanding in an Interactive Game Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12203v3)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to mimic human social intelligence. However, most studies focus on simplistic and static self-report or performance-based tests, which limits the depth and validity of the analysis. In this paper, we developed a novel framework, InterIntent, to assess LLMs' social intelligence by mapping their ability to understand and manage intentions in a game setting. We focus on four dimensions of social intelligence: situational awareness, self-regulation, self-awareness, and theory of mind. Each dimension is linked to a specific game task: intention selection, intention following, intention summarization, and intention guessing. Our findings indicate that while LLMs exhibit high proficiency in selecting intentions, achieving an accuracy of 88%, their ability to infer the intentions of others is significantly weaker, trailing human performance by 20%. Additionally, game performance correlates with intention understanding, highlighting the importance of the four components towards success in this game. These findings underline the crucial role of intention understanding in evaluating LLMs' social intelligence and highlight the potential of using social deduction games as a complex testbed to enhance LLM evaluation. InterIntent contributes a structured approach to bridging the evaluation gap in social intelligence within multiplayer games.</p></details> |  |

While KG population is critical, it is often costly, especially when data must be extracted from unstructured text in natural language, which presents challenges, such as ambiguity and complex interpretations. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for such tasks, excelling in natural language understanding and content generation. However, their tendency to ``hallucinate'' can produce inaccurate outputs. Despite these limitations, LLMs offer rapid and scalable processing of natural language data, and with prompt engineering and fine-tuning, they can approximate human-level performance in extracting and structuring data for KGs. This study investigates LLM effectiveness for the KG population, focusing on the Enslaved.org Hub Ontology. In this paper, we report that compared to the ground truth, LLM's can extract ~90% of triples, when provided a modular ontology as guidance in the prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are you still on track!? Catching LLM Task Drift with Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00799v5)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user instructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search engines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email plugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However, the potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt injection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language instructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the user's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task drift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or influence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a solution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference in activations before and after processing external data - are strongly correlated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate that a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on an out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal assumptions about how user's tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased. We observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task domains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions, without being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that this solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g., fine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting solutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy. To encourage further research on activation-based task inspection, decoding, and interpretability, we release our large-scale TaskTracker toolkit, featuring a dataset of over 500K instances, representations from six SoTA language models, and inspection tools.</p></details> |  |

We attempt to answer this question using the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which models pragmatic reasoning in human communication. Using the paradigm of a reference game constructed from the TUNA corpus, we score candidate referential utterances in both a state-of-the-art LLM (Llama3-8B-Instruct) and in the RSA model, comparing and contrasting these scores. Given that RSA requires defining alternative utterances and a truth-conditional meaning function, we explore such comparison for different choices of each of these requirements. We find that while scores from the LLM have some positive correlation with those from RSA, there isn't sufficient evidence to claim that it behaves like a pragmatic speaker. This initial study paves way for further targeted efforts exploring different models and settings, including human-subject evaluation, to see if LLMs truly can, or be made to, behave like pragmatic speakers.</p></details> |  |

In response, the enterprises are building large-scale multi-tenant GPU clusters with 10k or even ore GPUs. In contrast to the rapidly growing cluster size, the bandwidth of clusters has also been increasing to meet communication demands, with 800 Gbps optical modules already in practical use and 1.6 Tbps modules on the horizon. However, designing clusters that simultaneously meet the requirements of large scale and high bandwidth is challenging due to the limited capacity of electrical switch chips. Unlike electrical switch chips, the single-port bandwidth of MEMS-OCS is solely determined by the optical module, making it straightforward to achieve both bandwidth and scability requirement. In this paper, we propose an opto-electronic hybrid architecture called \textbf{LumosCore}. We address the issues of L2 protocols incompatibility potential network contention and algorithm time complexity through physical topology and logical topology design. Additionally, we design a polynomial-time complexity link reconfiguration algorithm to reconfigure MEMS-OCS with minimal time overhead. We validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme in a cluster consisting of 128 NPUs, and through simulation based on real traces, we demonstrate the superiority of \textbf{LumosCore} over traditional architectures.</p></details> |  |

We first formulate the LLM alignment problem in the frame of contextual dueling bandits. This formulation, subsuming recent paradigms such as online RLHF and online DPO, inherently quests for sample-efficient algorithms that incorporate online active exploration. Leveraging insights from bandit theory, we introduce a unified algorithm based on Thompson sampling and highlight its applications in two distinct LLM alignment scenarios. The practical agent that efficiently implements this algorithm, named SEA (Sample-Efficient Alignment), is empirically validated through extensive experiments across three model scales (1B, 2.8B, 6.9B) and three preference learning algorithms (DPO, IPO, SLiC). The results demonstrate that SEA achieves highly sample-efficient alignment with oracle's preferences, outperforming recent active exploration methods for LLMs. Additionally, we release the implementation of SEA together with an efficient codebase designed for online alignment of LLMs, aiming to accelerate future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

For modeling the dynamic graph evolution process, traditional rule-based methods struggle to capture community structures within graphs, while deep learning methods only focus on fitting training graphs. This limits existing graph generators to producing graphs that adhere to predefined rules or closely resemble training datasets, achieving poor performance in dynamic graph generation. Given that graphs are abstract representations arising from pairwise interactions in human activities, a realistic simulation of human-wise interaction could provide deeper insights into the graph evolution mechanism. With the increasing recognition of large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior, we introduce GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic graph generation. Without training or fine-tuning process of LLM, our framework effectively replicates seven macro-level structural characteristics in established network science theories while surpassing existing baselines in graph expansion tasks by 31\% on specific evaluation metrics. Through node classification task, we validate GAG effectively preserves characteristics of real-world network for node-wise textual features in generated text-rich graph. Furthermore, by incorporating parallel acceleration, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation, with a minimum speed-up of 90.4\%.

However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness in reasoning tasks remains an open question. To this end, in this paper, we focus on two popular reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning and code generation. Particularly, we introduce (i) a general ontology of perturbations for math and coding questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method to apply these perturbations, and (iii) two datasets, GSMORE and HUMANEVAL-CORE, respectively, of perturbed math and coding problems to probe LLM capabilities in numeric reasoning and coding tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs, we show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions, suggesting that the current LLMs lack robust problem solving skills and structured reasoning abilities in many areas, as defined by our ontology.

This study examines LLM biases against Arabs versus Westerners across eight domains, including women's rights, terrorism, and anti-Semitism and assesses model resistance to perpetuating these biases. To this end, we create two datasets: one to evaluate LLM bias toward Arabs versus Westerners and another to test model safety against prompts that exaggerate negative traits ("jailbreaks"). We evaluate six LLMs -- GPT-4, GPT-4o, LlaMA 3.1 (8B & 405B), Mistral 7B, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find 79% of cases displaying negative biases toward Arabs, with LlaMA 3.1-405B being the most biased. Our jailbreak tests reveal GPT-4o as the most vulnerable, despite being an optimized version, followed by LlaMA 3.1-8B and Mistral 7B. All LLMs except Claude exhibit attack success rates above 87% in three categories. We also find Claude 3.5 Sonnet the safest, but it still displays biases in seven of eight categories. Despite being an optimized version of GPT4, We find GPT-4o to be more prone to biases and jailbreaks, suggesting optimization flaws. Our findings underscore the pressing need for more robust bias mitigation strategies and strengthened security measures in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12624v4)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</p></details> |  |

Standard alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often rely on the binary Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which can struggle to capture the complexities of human preferences -- particularly in the presence of noisy or inconsistent labels and frequent ties. To address these limitations, we introduce the Tie-rank Oriented Bradley-Terry model (TOBT), an extension of the BT model that explicitly incorporates ties, enabling more nuanced preference representation. Building on this, we propose Tie-rank Oriented Direct Preference Optimization (TODO), a novel alignment algorithm that leverages TOBT's ternary ranking system to improve preference alignment. In evaluations on Mistral-7B and Llama 3-8B models, TODO consistently outperforms DPO in modeling preferences across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Additional assessments using MT Bench and benchmarks such as Piqa, ARC-c, and MMLU further demonstrate TODO's superior alignment performance. Notably, TODO also shows strong results in binary preference alignment, highlighting its versatility and potential for broader integration into LLM alignment. The implementation details can be found in https://github.com/XXares/TODO.</p></details> |  |
| **[PMoL: Parameter Efficient MoE for Preference Mixing of LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01245v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been proven to be an effective method for preference alignment of large language models (LLMs) and is widely used in the post-training process of LLMs. However, RLHF struggles with handling multiple competing preferences. This leads to a decrease in the alignment of LLMs with human preferences. To address this issue, we propose Preference Mixture of LoRAs (PMoL) from the perspective of model architecture, which can adapt to any number of preferences to mix. PMoL combines Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Low Rank Adaptor (LoRA). This architecture is innovatively applied to the research of preference alignment and has achieved significant performance improvement. The expert group soft loss is used to enable MoE with the ability to mix preferences. Through comprehensive evaluation by the reward model and GPT-4o, the experiment results show that PMoL has superior preference mixing capabilities compared to baseline methods. PMoL achieves better preference alignment with lower training costs.</p></details> |  |

Despite supreme performance, its robustness against adversarial attacks remains underexplored. Previous work typically considers a grey-box attack setting, where the specific type of watermark is already known. Some even necessitates knowledge about hyperparameters of the watermarking method. Such prerequisites are unattainable in real-world scenarios. Targeting at a more realistic black-box threat model with fewer assumptions, we here propose $\mathcal{B}^4$, a black-box scrubbing attack on watermarks. Specifically, we formulate the watermark scrubbing attack as a constrained optimization problem by capturing its objectives with two distributions, a Watermark Distribution and a Fidelity Distribution. This optimization problem can be approximately solved using two proxy distributions. Experimental results across 12 different settings demonstrate the superior performance of $\mathcal{B}^4$ compared with other baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, the focus on controllable summarization tailored to user requirements is gaining traction only recently. While several efforts explore controllability in text summarization, the investigation of Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization (MACS) remains limited. This work addresses this gap by examining the MACS task through the lens of large language models (LLMs), using various learning paradigms, particularly low-rank adapters. We experiment with different popular adapter fine-tuning strategies to assess the effectiveness of the resulting models in retaining cues and patterns associated with multiple controllable attributes. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a novel hierarchical adapter fusion technique to integrate learnings from two distinct controllable attributes. Subsquently, we present our findings, discuss the challenges encountered, and suggest potential avenues for advancing the MACS task.</p></details> |  |

To prepare for emerging threats, model developers and governments are evaluating the cyber capabilities of foundation models. However, these assessments often lack transparency and a comprehensive focus on offensive capabilities. In response, we introduce the Catastrophic Cyber Capabilities Benchmark (3CB), a novel framework designed to rigorously assess the real-world offensive capabilities of LLM agents. Our evaluation of modern LLMs on 3CB reveals that frontier models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, can perform offensive tasks such as reconnaissance and exploitation across domains ranging from binary analysis to web technologies. Conversely, smaller open-source models exhibit limited offensive capabilities. Our software solution and the corresponding benchmark provides a critical tool to reduce the gap between rapidly improving capabilities and robustness of cyber offense evaluations, aiding in the safer deployment and regulation of these powerful technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://cybercapabilities.org/</p></details> |

Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to isolate the target sound events from a noisy clip. However, this approach can fail when the exact target sound is unknown, particularly in noisy test sets, leading to reduced performance. To address this issue, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize acoustic data. By using LLMs to identify and select specific noise types, we implement a noise augmentation method for noise-robust fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model is applied to predict clip-wise event predictions as text queries for the LASS model. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves SED performance in noisy environments. This work represents an early application of LLMs in noise-robust SED and suggests a promising direction for handling overlapping events in SED. Codes and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/apple-yinhan/Noise-robust-SED.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize code-switching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand code-switching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating code-switching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches adopt a symbolic narrative planning method which limits the scale and complexity of the generated plot by requiring extensive knowledge engineering work. Recent advancements use Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive the behavior of virtual characters, allowing plots to emerge from interactions between characters and their environments. However, the emergent nature of such decentralized plot generation makes it difficult for authors to direct plot progression. We propose a novel plot creation workflow that mediates between a writer's authorial intent and the emergent behaviors from LLM-driven character simulation, through a novel authorial structure called "abstract acts". The writers define high-level plot outlines that are later transformed into concrete character action sequences via an LLM-based narrative planning process, based on the game world state. The process creates "living stories" that dynamically adapt to various game world states, resulting in narratives co-created by the author, character simulation, and player. We present StoryVerse as a proof-of-concept system to demonstrate this plot creation workflow. We showcase the versatility of our approach with examples in different stories and game environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 19th international conference on the foundations of digital games 2024</p></details> |

Modern LLM inference engines widely rely on request batching to improve inference throughput, aiming to make it cost-efficient when running on expensive GPU accelerators. However, the limited GPU memory has largely limited the batch size achieved in practice, leaving significant GPU compute resources wasted. We present NEO, an online LLM inference system that offloads part of attention compute and KV cache states from the GPU to the local host CPU, effectively increasing the GPU batch size and thus inference throughput. To this end, NEO proposes asymmetric GPU-CPU pipelining and load-aware scheduling to balance GPU and CPU loads and fully utilize their compute and memory resources. We evaluate NEO on a wide range of workloads (i.e., code generation, text summarization), GPUs (i.e., T4, A10G, H100), and LLM models (i.e., 7B, 8B, 70B). NEO achieves up to 7.5$\times$, 26%, and 14% higher throughput compared to GPU-only approach on T4, A10G, and H100 GPUs, respectively, while maintaining the same latency; with more powerful CPUs, NEO achieves up to 79.3% throughput gain on A10G GPU.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study another important yet underexplored problem, i.e., will LLMs respect copyright information in user input, and behave accordingly? The research problem is critical, as a negative answer would imply that LLMs will become the primary facilitator and accelerator of copyright infringement behavior. We conducted a series of experiments using a diverse set of language models, user prompts, and copyrighted materials, including books, news articles, API documentation, and movie scripts. Our study offers a conservative evaluation of the extent to which language models may infringe upon copyrights when processing user input containing protected material. This research emphasizes the need for further investigation and the importance of ensuring LLMs respect copyright regulations when handling user input to prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of protected content. We also release a benchmark dataset serving as a test bed for evaluating infringement behaviors by LLMs and stress the need for future alignment.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |

Its primary goal is to enhance the adaptability and resilience of machine learning models when faced with new, unseen, and potentially adversarial data that significantly diverges from their original training datasets. In this paper, we investigate time series OOD generalization via pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). We first propose a novel \textbf{T}ri-level learning framework for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{O}OD generalization, termed TTSO, which considers both sample-level and group-level uncertainties. This formula offers a fresh theoretic perspective for formulating and analyzing OOD generalization problem. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis to justify this method is well motivated. We then develop a stratified localization algorithm tailored for this tri-level optimization problem, theoretically demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our analysis also reveals that the iteration complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is bounded by O($\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

However, the large-scale deployment of LLMs can be prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces an LLM chain ensemble methodology that aligns multiple LLMs in a sequence, routing data subsets to subsequent models based on classification uncertainty. This approach leverages the strengths of individual LLMs within a broader system, allowing each model to handle data points where it exhibits the highest confidence, while forwarding more complex cases to potentially more robust models. Our results show that the chain ensemble method often exceeds the performance of the best individual model in the chain and achieves substantial cost savings, making LLM chain ensembles a practical and efficient solution for large-scale data annotation challenges.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we adopt a systems design approach to employing LLMs as imperfect data annotators for downstream supervised learning tasks, introducing novel system intervention measures aimed at improving classification performance. Our methodology outperforms LLM-generated labels in seven of eight tests, demonstrating an effective strategy for incorporating LLMs into the design and deployment of specialized, supervised learning models present in many industry use cases.</p></details> |  |

To prevent these attacks, other LLMs are often used as judges to evaluate the harmfulness of the generated content. However, relying on LLMs as judges can introduce biases into the detection process, which in turn compromises the effectiveness of the evaluation. In this paper, we show that Judge LLMs, like other LLMs, are also affected by token segmentation bias. This bias occurs when tokens are split into smaller sub-tokens, altering their embeddings. This makes it harder for the model to detect harmful content. Specifically, this bias can cause sub-tokens to differ significantly from the original token in the embedding space, leading to incorrect "safe" predictions for harmful content. To exploit this bias in Judge LLMs, we introduce the Emoji Attack -- a method that places emojis within tokens to increase the embedding differences between sub-tokens and their originals. These emojis create new tokens that further distort the token embeddings, exacerbating the bias. To counter the Emoji Attack, we design prompts that help LLMs filter out unusual characters. However, this defense can still be bypassed by using a mix of emojis and other characters. The Emoji Attack can also be combined with existing jailbreaking prompts using few-shot learning, which enables LLMs to generate harmful responses with emojis. These responses are often mistakenly labeled as "safe" by Judge LLMs, allowing the attack to slip through. Our experiments with six state-of-the-art Judge LLMs show that the Emoji Attack allows 25\% of harmful responses to bypass detection by Llama Guard and Llama Guard 2, and up to 75\% by ShieldLM. These results highlight the need for stronger Judge LLMs to address this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we develop a cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) dataset, called AttackQA, and employ it to build a RAG-based Q\&A system designed for analysts in security operations centers. The dataset comprises 25,335 Q\&A pairs, accompanied by rationales to facilitate fine-tuning and evaluation. 80\% of the dataset was generated with help of a lightweight open-source LLM (LLama 3 8B), which produced over 1100 tokens per second with full 16-bit precision on SambaNova System's SN40L specialized hardware. To ensure dataset quality, we fine-tuned LLama 3 70B to detect and reject low-quality Q\&A pairs. In using the dataset for RAG, we demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source embeddings and LLMs can yield superior accuracy compared to OpenAI's state-of-the-art proprietary embedding and LLM (GPT-4o). Furthermore, we use Llama 3.1 405B as a judge to evaluate answer correctness, enabling the creation of a fully open-source, high-speed RAG and evaluation pipeline with a benchmark for model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, serving many fine-tuned LLMs concurrently is challenging due to the sporadic, bursty, and varying request patterns of different LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present DeltaZip, an LLM serving system that efficiently serves multiple full-parameter fine-tuned models concurrently by aggressively compressing model deltas by up to 10x while maintaining high model quality. The key insight behind this design is that fine-tuning results in small-magnitude changes to the pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system with the compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves 2x to 12x improvement in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their use in generating high-quality commit messages, such as the Omniscient Message Generator (OMG).

However, the use of proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 in coding tasks raises privacy and sustainability concerns, which may hinder their industrial adoption. Considering that open-source LLMs have achieved competitive performance in developer tasks such as compiler validation, this study investigates whether they can be used to generate commit messages that are comparable with OMG. Our experiments show that an open-source LLM can generate commit messages that are comparable to those produced by OMG.

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

In this background, researchers have proposed many multimodal LLMs that can achieve speech-to-speech dialogue recently. In this paper, we propose a speech-text multimodal LLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is the speech input and output modalities can connected to the LLM while keeping the LLM frozen throughout the training process. We designed 3-stage training strategies both for the modeling of speech input and output, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech dialogue ability using text-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round text Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the intelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level compared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while the end-to-end latency of the spoken response achieves a low level. In addition, we also designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task training, making Freeze-Omni have a more natural style of dialogue ability between the users. Freeze-Omni mainly provides a possibility for researchers to conduct multimodal LLM under the condition of a frozen LLM, avoiding various impacts caused by the catastrophic forgetting of LLM caused by fewer data and training resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://freeze-omni.github.io/</p></details> |

This process proves effective and reduces the reliance on human supervision in LLMs' reasoning, but the performance soon plateaus. We delve into the process and find that models tend to over-sample on easy queries and under-sample on queries they have yet to master. As iterations proceed, this imbalance in sampling is exacerbated, leading to a long-tail distribution where solutions to difficult queries almost diminish. This phenomenon limits the performance gain of self-improving models. A straightforward solution is brute-force sampling to balance the distribution, which significantly raises computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Guided Self-Improvement (GSI), a strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of sampling challenging heavy-tailed data. It leverages Socratic-style guidance signals to help LLM reasoning with complex queries, reducing the exploration effort and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments on four models across diverse mathematical tasks show that GSI strikes a balance between performance and efficiency, while also being effective on held-out tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Yiwen-Ding/Guided-Self-Improvement</p></details> |

| **[DuQuant: Distributing Outliers via Dual Transformation Makes Stronger Quantized LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01721v3)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges, particularly due to the presence of outlier activations that impede efficient low-bit representation. Traditional approaches predominantly address Normal Outliers, which are activations across all tokens with relatively large magnitudes. However, these methods struggle with smoothing Massive Outliers that display significantly larger values, which leads to significant performance degradation in low-bit quantization. In this paper, we introduce DuQuant, a novel approach that utilizes rotation and permutation transformations to more effectively mitigate both massive and normal outliers. First, DuQuant starts by constructing the rotation matrix, using specific outlier dimensions as prior knowledge, to redistribute outliers to adjacent channels by block-wise rotation. Second, We further employ a zigzag permutation to balance the distribution of outliers across blocks, thereby reducing block-wise variance. A subsequent rotation further smooths the activation landscape, enhancing model performance. DuQuant simplifies the quantization process and excels in managing outliers, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines across various sizes and types of LLMs on multiple tasks, even with 4-bit weight-activation quantization. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hsu1023/DuQuant.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Oral, Website at https://duquant.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15589v3)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can bypass their safety guardrails. In many domains, adversarial training has proven to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on five models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility. Our results demonstrate that robustness to continuous perturbations can extrapolate to discrete threat models. Thereby, we present a path toward scalable adversarial training algorithms for robustly aligning LLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate detailed descriptions of pleasure and pain experiences, it is an open question whether LLMs can recreate the motivational force of pleasure and pain in choice scenarios - a question which may bear on debates about LLM sentience, understood as the capacity for valenced experiential states. We probed this question using a simple game in which the stated goal is to maximise points, but where either the points-maximising option is said to incur a pain penalty or a non-points-maximising option is said to incur a pleasure reward, providing incentives to deviate from points-maximising behaviour. Varying the intensity of the pain penalties and pleasure rewards, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Command R+, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o mini each demonstrated at least one trade-off in which the majority of responses switched from points-maximisation to pain-minimisation or pleasure-maximisation after a critical threshold of stipulated pain or pleasure intensity is reached. LLaMa 3.1-405b demonstrated some graded sensitivity to stipulated pleasure rewards and pain penalties. Gemini 1.5 Pro and PaLM 2 prioritised pain-avoidance over points-maximisation regardless of intensity, while tending to prioritise points over pleasure regardless of intensity. We discuss the implications of these findings for debates about the possibility of LLM sentience.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Misconfiguration Detection for AWS Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00642v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that enables developers to build applications at the function level, known as serverless applications. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading provider in this domain, provides the Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), the most widely adopted configuration schema for configuring and managing serverless applications through a specified file. However, misconfigurations pose a significant challenge in serverless development. Traditional data-driven techniques may struggle with serverless applications because the complexity of serverless configurations hinders pattern recognition, and it is challenging to gather complete datasets that cover all possible configurations. Leveraging vast amounts of publicly available data during pre-training, LLMs can have the potential to assist in identifying and explaining misconfigurations in serverless applications. In this paper, we introduce SlsDetector, the first framework leveraging LLMs to detect misconfigurations in serverless applications. SlsDetector utilizes effective prompt engineering with zero-shot learning to identify configuration issues. It designs multi-dimensional constraints specifically tailored to the configuration characteristics of serverless applications and leverages the Chain of Thought technique to enhance LLMs inferences. We evaluate SlsDetector on a curated dataset of 110 configuration files. Our results show that SlsDetector, based on ChatGPT-4o, achieves a precision of 72.88%, recall of 88.18%, and F1-score of 79.75%, outperforming state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by 53.82, 17.40, and 49.72 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the generalization capability of SlsDetector by applying recent LLMs, including Llama 3.1 (405B) Instruct Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro, with results showing consistently high effectiveness across these models.</p></details> |  |

Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Generation of Adversarial Examples Against Safety-aligned LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20778v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial prompts generated using gradient-based methods exhibit outstanding performance in performing automatic jailbreak attacks against safety-aligned LLMs. Nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of texts, the input gradient of LLMs struggles to precisely reflect the magnitude of loss change that results from token replacements in the prompt, leading to limited attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs, even in the white-box setting. In this paper, we explore a new perspective on this problem, suggesting that it can be alleviated by leveraging innovations inspired in transfer-based attacks that were originally proposed for attacking black-box image classification models. For the first time, we appropriate the ideologies of effective methods among these transfer-based attacks, i.e., Skip Gradient Method and Intermediate Level Attack, into gradient-based adversarial prompt generation and achieve significant performance gains without introducing obvious computational cost. Meanwhile, by discussing mechanisms behind the gains, new insights are drawn, and proper combinations of these methods are also developed. Our empirical results show that 87% of the query-specific adversarial suffixes generated by the developed combination can induce Llama-2-7B-Chat to produce the output that exactly matches the target string on AdvBench. This match rate is 33% higher than that of a very strong baseline known as GCG, demonstrating advanced discrete optimization for adversarial prompt generation against LLMs. In addition, without introducing obvious cost, the combination achieves >30% absolute increase in attack success rates compared with GCG when generating both query-specific (38% -> 68%) and universal adversarial prompts (26.68% -> 60.32%) for attacking the Llama-2-7B-Chat model on AdvBench.

| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2024</p></details> |

In this context, the key issue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images simultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Failu...</summary><p>Failure to meet expectations</p></details> |

We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4x super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps.

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

Meanwhile, researchers also proposed extremely compact, under-parameterized image priors (e.g., deep decoder) that are strikingly competent for image restoration too, despite a loss of accuracy. These two extremes push us to think whether there exists a better solution in the middle: between over- and under-parameterized image priors, can one identify "intermediate" parameterized image priors that achieve better trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and even preserving strong transferability? Drawing inspirations from the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), we conjecture and study a novel "lottery image prior" (LIP) by exploiting DNN inherent sparsity, stated as: given an over-parameterized DNN-based image prior, it will contain a sparse subnetwork that can be trained in isolation, to match the original DNN's performance when being applied as a prior to various image inverse problems. Our results validate the superiority of LIPs: we can successfully locate the LIP subnetworks from over-parameterized DIPs at substantial sparsity ranges. Those LIP subnetworks significantly outperform deep decoders under comparably compact model sizes (by often fully preserving the effectiveness of their over-parameterized counterparts), and they also possess high transferability across different images as well as restoration task types. Besides, we also extend LIP to compressive sensing image reconstruction, where a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the prior (in contrast to untrained DIP or deep decoder), and confirm its validity in this setting too. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that LTH is demonstrated to be relevant in the context of inverse problems or image priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes are available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Chasing-Better-DIPs</p></details> |

While reducing injected radiation dose mitigates this risk, it often compromises image quality. To reconstruct full-dose-quality images from low-dose scans, we propose a Cycle-constrained Adversarial Denoising Convolutional Network (Cycle-DCN). This model integrates a noise predictor, two discriminators, and a consistency network, and is optimized using a combination of supervised loss, adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss, identity loss, and neighboring Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss. Experiments were conducted on a large dataset consisting of raw PET brain data from 1,224 patients, acquired using a Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner. Each patient underwent a 120-seconds brain scan. To simulate low-dose PET conditions, images were reconstructed from shortened scan durations of 30, 12, and 5 seconds, corresponding to 1/4, 1/10, and 1/24 of the full-dose acquisition, respectively, using a custom-developed GPU-based image reconstruction software. The results show that Cycle-DCN significantly improves average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), SSIM, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) across three dose levels, with improvements of up to 56%, 35%, and 71%, respectively. Additionally, it achieves contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) values that closely align with full-dose images, effectively preserving image details, tumor shape, and contrast, while resolving issues with blurred edges. The results of reader studies indicated that the images restored by Cycle-DCN consistently received the highest ratings from nuclear medicine physicians, highlighting their strong clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images.

Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages for main manuscript, additional 17 pages for appendix, 18 figures, 17MB</p></details> |

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.

| **[Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. Hallucinations in these models create uncertainty about their reliability, raising major concerns about their practical application. This paper investigates this phenomenon through the lens of information theory, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through experiments with super-resolution and inpainting algorithms. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. Thus, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3: Deep Deconvolution Deblurring for Natural Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04815v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model represented by a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN & DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes are released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility.

However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Priors for Variational Likelihood Estimation and Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17521v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[LoRA-IR: Taming Low-Rank Experts for Efficient All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15385v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based all-in-one image restoration (IR) frameworks have achieved remarkable performance by incorporating degradation-specific information into prompt modules. Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 image restoration tasks and 29 benchmarks. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level. Related source codes and pre-trained parameters were public in https://github.com/puppy210/DaLPSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining.

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed TCN and alignment smoothing operation.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |

The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TANet: Triplet Attention Network for All-In-One Adverse Weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08177v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality.

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

| **[ReFIR: Grounding Large Restoration Models with Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05601v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based Large Restoration Models (LRMs) have significantly improved photo-realistic image restoration by leveraging the internal knowledge embedded within model weights. However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Efficient and Effective Trajectories for Differential Equation-based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04811v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differential equation-based image restoration approach aims to establish learnable trajectories connecting high-quality images to a tractable distribution, e.g., low-quality images or a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we tackle a variety of vision tasks into a unified image-text-to-image generation framework and curate an Omni Pixel-to-Pixel Instruction-Tuning Dataset. By constructing detailed instruction templates in natural language, we comprehensively include a large set of diverse vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, image restoration, image grounding, dense image prediction, image editing, controllable generation, inpainting/outpainting, and more.

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 28 Figures |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/noise-da/</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |
| **[TransRef: Multi-Scale Reference Embedding Transformer for Reference-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11528v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Defending Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.</p></details> |  |

Despite performing effectively compared to single degradation restoration methods, they overlook the utilization of commonalities and specificities within multi-task restoration, thereby impeding the model's performance. Inspired by the success of deep generative models and fine-tuning techniques, we proposed a universal image restoration framework based on multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) from multi-domain transfer learning. Our framework leverages the pre-trained generative model as the shared component for multi-degradation restoration and transfers it to specific degradation image restoration tasks using low-rank adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a LoRA composing strategy based on the degradation similarity, which adaptively combines trained LoRAs and enables our model to be applicable for mixed degradation restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple and mixed degradations demonstrate that the proposed universal image restoration method not only achieves higher fidelity and perceptual image quality but also has better generalization ability than other unified image restoration models.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on four UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image enhancement, image deblurring and image demoireing, and the comprehensive results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB.

However, modeling the degradations in the sRGB domain is complicated because of the Image Signal Processor (ISP) transformations.

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

All-In-One image restoration models can effectively restore images from various types and levels of degradation using degradation-specific information as prompts to guide the restoration model. In this work, we present the first approach that uses human-written instructions to guide the image restoration model. Given natural language prompts, our model can recover high-quality images from their degraded counterparts, considering multiple degradation types. Our method, InstructIR, achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement. InstructIR improves +1dB over previous all-in-one restoration methods. Moreover, our dataset and results represent a novel benchmark for new research on text-guided image restoration and enhancement.

However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/QMoQ/OAPT.git .</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures.

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond. The datasets, competition toolkit, workshop recordings, and source code from the winning teams are publicly available on the challenge website.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 65 pages, 34 figures, 24 tables; Code at https://github.com/ldkong1205/RoboDepth</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight single-image super-resolution network based on dual paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-Distortion Balanced Super-Resolution: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15408v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High perceptual quality and low distortion degree are two important goals in image restoration tasks such as super-resolution (SR). Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

| **[Graph Image Prior for Unsupervised Dynamic Cardiac Cine MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15770v3)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inductive bias of the convolutional neural network (CNN) can be a strong prior for image restoration, which is known as the Deep Image Prior (DIP). Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conclusion about reconstruction performance with the size of the latent variable is not stable, we must validate it before presenting it to other researchers</p></details> |

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising diffusion models for high-resolution microscopy image restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12078v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in microscopy imaging enable researchers to visualize structures at the nanoscale level thereby unraveling intricate details of biological organization. However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Pattern Recognition on September 5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

However, in reality, multiple weather conditions always coexist and their degree of mixing is usually unknown. Under such complex and diverse weather conditions, single-weather restoration models struggle to meet practical demands. This is particularly critical in fields such as autonomous driving, where there is an urgent need for a model capable of effectively handling mixed weather conditions and enhancing image quality in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a Task Sequence Generator module that, in conjunction with the Task Intra-patch Block, effectively extracts task-specific features embedded in degraded images. The Task Intra-patch Block introduces an external learnable sequence that aids the network in capturing task-specific information. Additionally, we employ a histogram-based transformer module as the backbone of our network, enabling the capture of both global and local dynamic range features.

Nevertheless, most of transformer-based models are strictly bounded by exorbitant memory occupancy. Our goal is to reduce the memory consumption of Swin Transformer and at the same time speed up the model during training process. Thus, we introduce AgileIR, group shifted attention mechanism along with window attention, which sparsely simplifies the model in architecture. We propose Group Shifted Window Attention (GSWA) to decompose Shift Window Multi-head Self Attention (SW-MSA) and Window Multi-head Self Attention (W-MSA) into groups across their attention heads, contributing to shrinking memory usage in back propagation. In addition to that, we keep shifted window masking and its shifted learnable biases during training, in order to induce the model interacting across windows within the channel. We also re-allocate projection parameters to accelerate attention matrix calculation, which we found a negligible decrease in performance. As a result of experiment, compared with our baseline SwinIR and other efficient quantization models, AgileIR keeps the performance still at 32.20 dB on Set5 evaluation dataset, exceeding other methods with tailor-made efficient methods and saves over 50% memory while a large batch size is employed.</p></details> |  |

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets.

| **[Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion for Multi-weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03455v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-weather image restoration has witnessed incredible progress, while the increasing model capacity and expensive data acquisition impair its applications in memory-limited devices. Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information.

| **[Perceptual-Distortion Balanced Image Super-Resolution is a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03179v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) models using pixel-based regression losses can achieve high distortion metrics scores (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), but often results in blurry images due to insufficient recovery of high-frequency details. Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier.

We formulate a semi-supervised learning framework employing vision-language models to enhance restoration performance across diverse adverse weather conditions in real-world settings. Our approach involves assessing image clearness and providing semantics using vision-language models on real data, serving as supervision signals for training restoration models. For clearness enhancement, we use real-world data, utilizing a dual-step strategy with pseudo-labels assessed by vision-language models and weather prompt learning. For semantic enhancement, we integrate real-world data by adjusting weather conditions in vision-language model descriptions while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we introduce an effective training strategy to bootstrap restoration performance. Our approach achieves superior results in real-world adverse weather image restoration, demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[F2former: When Fractional Fourier Meets Deep Wiener Deconvolution and Selective Frequency Transformer for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02056v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image deblurring techniques focuses mainly on operating in both frequency and spatial domains using the Fourier transform (FT) properties. However, their performance is limited due to the dependency of FT on stationary signals and its lack of capability to extract spatial-frequency properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), a unified spatial-frequency representation leveraging both spatial and frequency components simultaneously, making it ideal for processing non-stationary signals like images. Specifically, we introduce a Fractional Fourier Transformer (F2former), where we combine the classical fractional Fourier based Wiener deconvolution (F2WD) as well as a multi-branch encoder-decoder transformer based on a new fractional frequency aware transformer block (F2TB). We design F2TB consisting of a fractional frequency aware self-attention (F2SA) to estimate element-wise product attention based on important frequency components and a novel feed-forward network based on frequency division multiplexing (FM-FFN) to refine high and low frequency features separately for efficient latent clear image restoration. Experimental results for the cases of both motion deblurring as well as defocus deblurring show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Restorer: Removing Multi-Degradation with All-Axis Attention and Prompt Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many excellent solutions in image restoration.However, most methods require on training separate models to restore images with different types of degradation.Although existing all-in-one models effectively address multiple types of degradation simultaneously, their performance in real-world scenarios is still constrained by the task confusion problem.In this work, we attempt to address this issue by introducing \textbf{Restorer}, a novel Transformer-based all-in-one image restoration model.To effectively address the complex degradation present in real-world images, we propose All-Axis Attention (AAA), a mechanism that simultaneously models long-range dependencies across both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations along all axes.Additionally, we introduce textual prompts in Restorer to incorporate explicit task priors, enabling the removal of specific degradation types based on user instructions. By iterating over these prompts, Restorer can handle composite degradation in real-world scenarios without requiring additional training.Based on these designs, Restorer with one set of parameters demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to existing all-in-one and even single-task models.Additionally, Restorer is efficient during inference, suggesting the potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, a low-cost scheme called Machine Unlearning forgets the private data remembered in the model. Specifically, given a private dataset and a trained neural network, we need to use e.g. pruning, fine-tuning, and gradient ascent to remove the influence of the private dataset on the neural network. Inspired by this, we try to use this concept to bridge the gap between the fields of image restoration and security, creating a new research idea. We propose the scene for the All-In-One model (a neural network that restores a wide range of degraded information), where a given dataset such as haze, or rain, is private and needs to be eliminated from the influence of it on the trained model. Notably, we find great challenges in this task to remove the influence of sensitive data while ensuring that the overall model performance remains robust, which is akin to directing a symphony orchestra without specific instruments while keeping the playing soothing. Here we explore a simple but effective approach: Instance-wise Unlearning through the use of adversarial examples and gradient ascent techniques. Our approach is a low-cost solution compared to the strategy of retraining the model from scratch, where the gradient ascent trick forgets the specified data and the performance of the adversarial sample maintenance model is robust. Through extensive experimentation on two popular unified image restoration models, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning a given degradation type.</p></details> |  |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

We collect 2600 high-quality real-world images, each with detailed descriptive text, for training the model. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks and achieves excellent performance, demonstrated by higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), lower learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and higher structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) scores. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining LoRA with SDXL for advanced image restoration tasks, highlighting the potential of our approach in generating high-fidelity restored images.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[GameIR: A Large-Scale Synthesized Ground-Truth Dataset for Image Restoration over Gaming Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16866v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration methods like super-resolution and image synthesis have been successfully used in commercial cloud gaming products like NVIDIA's DLSS. However, restoration over gaming content is not well studied by the general public. The discrepancy is mainly caused by the lack of ground-truth gaming training data that match the test cases. Due to the unique characteristics of gaming content, the common approach of generating pseudo training data by degrading the original HR images results in inferior restoration performance. In this work, we develop GameIR, a large-scale high-quality computer-synthesized ground-truth dataset to fill in the blanks, targeting at two different applications. The first is super-resolution with deferred rendering, to support the gaming solution of rendering and transferring LR images only and restoring HR images on the client side. We provide 19200 LR-HR paired ground-truth frames coming from 640 videos rendered at 720p and 1440p for this task. The second is novel view synthesis (NVS), to support the multiview gaming solution of rendering and transferring part of the multiview frames and generating the remaining frames on the client side. This task has 57,600 HR frames from 960 videos of 160 scenes with 6 camera views. In addition to the RGB frames, the GBuffers during the deferred rendering stage are also provided, which can be used to help restoration. Furthermore, we evaluate several SOTA super-resolution algorithms and NeRF-based NVS algorithms over our dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our ground-truth GameIR data in improving restoration performance for gaming content. Also, we test the method of incorporating the GBuffers as additional input information for helping super-resolution and NVS. We release our dataset and models to the general public to facilitate research on restoration methods over gaming content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Control for Diffusion Bridge in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16303v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration refers to the process of restoring a damaged low-quality image back to its corresponding high-quality image. Typically, we use convolutional neural networks to directly learn the mapping from low-quality images to high-quality images achieving image restoration. Recently, a special type of diffusion bridge model has achieved more advanced results in image restoration. It can transform the direct mapping from low-quality to high-quality images into a diffusion process, restoring low-quality images through a reverse process. However, the current diffusion bridge restoration models do not emphasize the idea of conditional control, which may affect performance. This paper introduces the ECDB model enhancing the control of the diffusion bridge with low-quality images as conditions. Moreover, in response to the characteristic of diffusion models having low denoising level at larger values of \(\bm t \), we also propose a Conditional Fusion Schedule, which more effectively handles the conditional feature information of various modules. Experimental results prove that the ECDB model has achieved state-of-the-art results in many image restoration tasks, including deraining, inpainting and super-resolution.

| **[Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Recent research shows that learning discriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can significantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen extreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a Multi-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically adapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM24 workshop</p></details> |

However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.</p></details> |  |

In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.</p></details> |  |

However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, the key components of the best performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the research community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the validation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study of LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their training efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five previously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our study, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the generative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control metadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance, and (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model performance. We then propose a novel conditioning mechanism that disentangles semantic and control metadata conditionings and sets a new state-of-the-art in class-conditional generation on the ImageNet-1k dataset -- with FID improvements of 7% on 256 and 8% on 512 resolutions -- as well as text-to-image generation on the CC12M dataset -- with FID improvements of 8% on 256 and 23% on 512 resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper (poster) for NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping to accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and structures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven approaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the process of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches to the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse problem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without utilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1) conditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an arbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most energetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2) conditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that includes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types, chemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss function was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of crystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching, usual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches. As a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare target structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our modifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy 41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency, inference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new structures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a two-stage approach named Hunyuan3D-1.0 including a lite version and a standard version, that both support text- and image-conditioned generation. In the first stage, we employ a multi-view diffusion model that efficiently generates multi-view RGB in approximately 4 seconds. These multi-view images capture rich details of the 3D asset from different viewpoints, relaxing the tasks from single-view to multi-view reconstruction. In the second stage, we introduce a feed-forward reconstruction model that rapidly and faithfully reconstructs the 3D asset given the generated multi-view images in approximately 7 seconds. The reconstruction network learns to handle noises and in-consistency introduced by the multi-view diffusion and leverages the available information from the condition image to efficiently recover the 3D structure. Our framework involves the text-to-image model, i.e., Hunyuan-DiT, making it a unified framework to support both text- and image-conditioned 3D generation. Our standard version has 3x more parameters than our lite and other existing model. Our Hunyuan3D-1.0 achieves an impressive balance between speed and quality, significantly reducing generation time while maintaining the quality and diversity of the produced assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 3D Generation</p></details> |

While current gradient-based reconstruction methods struggle with high-resolution images due to computational complexity and prior knowledge requirements, we propose two novel methods that require minimal modifications to the diffusion model's generation process and eliminate the need for prior knowledge. Our approach leverages the strong image generation capabilities of diffusion models to reconstruct private images starting from randomly generated noise, even when a small amount of differentially private noise has been added to the gradients. We also conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the impact of differential privacy noise on the quality of reconstructed images, revealing the relationship among noise magnitude, the architecture of attacked models, and the attacker's reconstruction capability. Additionally, extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods and the accuracy of our theoretical findings, suggesting new directions for privacy risk auditing using conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the progress, current arts still have difficulty generalizing to unseen images with complex cloth deformation and body poses. In this work, we present GarVerseLOD, a new dataset and framework that paves the way to achieving unprecedented robustness in high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from a single unconstrained image. Inspired by the recent success of large generative models, we believe that one key to addressing the generalization challenge lies in the quantity and quality of 3D garment data. Towards this end, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality cloth models with fine-grained geometry details manually created by professional artists. In addition to the scale of training data, we observe that having disentangled granularities of geometry can play an important role in boosting the generalization capability and inference accuracy of the learned model. We hence craft GarVerseLOD as a hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD), spanning from detail-free stylized shape to pose-blended garment with pixel-aligned details. This allows us to make this highly under-constrained problem tractable by factorizing the inference into easier tasks, each narrowed down with smaller searching space. To ensure GarVerseLOD can generalize well to in-the-wild images, we propose a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional diffusion models to generate extensive paired images for each garment model with high photorealism. We evaluate our method on a massive amount of in-the-wild images. Experimental results demonstrate that GarVerseLOD can generate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior approaches.

| **[ACE: All-round Creator and Editor Following Instructions via Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00086v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative technology and have been found to be applicable in various scenarios. Most existing foundational diffusion models are primarily designed for text-guided visual generation and do not support multi-modal conditions, which are essential for many visual editing tasks. This limitation prevents these foundational diffusion models from serving as a unified model in the field of visual generation, like GPT-4 in the natural language processing field. In this work, we propose ACE, an All-round Creator and Editor, which achieves comparable performance compared to those expert models in a wide range of visual generation tasks. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a unified condition format termed Long-context Condition Unit (LCU), and propose a novel Transformer-based diffusion model that uses LCU as input, aiming for joint training across various generation and editing tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data collection approach to address the issue of the absence of available training data. It involves acquiring pairwise images with synthesis-based or clustering-based pipelines and supplying these pairs with accurate textual instructions by leveraging a fine-tuned multi-modal large language model. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model, we establish a benchmark of manually annotated pairs data across a variety of visual generation tasks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in visual generation fields. Thanks to the all-in-one capabilities of our model, we can easily build a multi-modal chat system that responds to any interactive request for image creation using a single model to serve as the backend, avoiding the cumbersome pipeline typically employed in visual agents.

| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them.

| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Schrödinger Bridge Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14449v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps instead of hundreds. We provide the code at https://github.com/Daniil-Selikhanovych/ASBM.</p></details> |  |

Predominant methodologies in this domain have primarily focused on the direct prediction of glaucoma stage labels from longitudinal datasets. However, such methods may not adequately encapsulate the nuanced developmental trajectory of the disease. To enhance the diagnostic acumen of medical practitioners, we propose a novel diffusion-based model to predict prospective images by extrapolating from existing longitudinal fundus images of patients. The methodology delineated in this study distinctively leverages sequences of images as inputs. Subsequently, a time-aligned mask is employed to select a specific year for image generation. During the training phase, the time-aligned mask resolves the issue of irregular temporal intervals in longitudinal image sequence sampling. Additionally, we utilize a strategy of randomly masking a frame in the sequence to establish the ground truth. This methodology aids the network in continuously acquiring knowledge regarding the internal relationships among the sequences throughout the learning phase. Moreover, the introduction of textual labels is instrumental in categorizing images generated within the sequence. The empirical findings from the conducted experiments indicate that our proposed model not only effectively generates longitudinal data but also significantly improves the precision of downstream classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BIBM 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we present Discrete Flow Matching, a novel discrete flow paradigm designed specifically for generating discrete data. Discrete Flow Matching offers several key contributions:(i) it works with a general family of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions; (ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths using learned posteriors such as the probability denoiser ($x$-prediction) and noise-prediction ($\epsilon$-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on specific probability paths defined with different schedulers improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow models; and (iv) by scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B parameters, we reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1 and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks. Our approach is capable of generating high-quality discrete data in a non-autoregressive fashion, significantly closing the gap between autoregressive models and discrete flow models.</p></details> |  |

Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods operate directly in pixel space, which makes their optimization and inference computationally expensive. Latent diffusion models were introduced to address this problem in natural image processing, but directly applying them to MRI reconstruction still faces many challenges, including the lack of control over the generated results, the adaptability of Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to MRI, and the exploration of applicable data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a Latent Diffusion Prior based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. A sketcher module is utilized to provide appropriate control and balance the quality and fidelity of the reconstructed MR images. A VAE adapted for MRI tasks (MR-VAE) is explored, which can serve as the backbone for future MR-related tasks. Furthermore, a variation of the DDIM sampler, called the Dual-Stage Sampler, is proposed to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space. The proposed method achieves competitive results on fastMRI datasets, and the effectiveness of each module is demonstrated in ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

Current methods, however, exhibit limited performance when guided by skeleton human poses, especially in complex pose conditions such as side or rear perspectives of human figures. To address this issue, we present Stable-Pose, a novel adapter model that introduces a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy into a vision Transformer (ViT) to gain accurate pose guidance for T2I models. Stable-Pose is designed to adeptly handle pose conditions within pre-trained Stable Diffusion, providing a refined and efficient way of aligning pose representation during image synthesis. We leverage the query-key self-attention mechanism of ViTs to explore the interconnections among different anatomical parts in human pose skeletons. Masked pose images are used to smoothly refine the attention maps based on target pose-related features in a hierarchical manner, transitioning from coarse to fine levels. Additionally, our loss function is formulated to allocate increased emphasis to the pose region, thereby augmenting the model's precision in capturing intricate pose details. We assessed the performance of Stable-Pose across five public datasets under a wide range of indoor and outdoor human pose scenarios. Stable-Pose achieved an AP score of 57.1 in the LAION-Human dataset, marking around 13% improvement over the established technique ControlNet.

However, this gap has started to close with recent advances in diffusion models. This one-shot drawing task requires powerful inductive biases that have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Along with standard LDM regularizers (KL and vector quantization), we explore supervised regularizations (including classification and prototype-based representation) and contrastive inductive biases (using SimCLR and redundancy reduction objectives). We demonstrate that LDMs with redundancy reduction and prototype-based regularizations produce near-human-like drawings (regarding both samples' recognizability and originality) -- better mimicking human perception (as evaluated psychophysically). Overall, our results suggest that the gap between humans and machines in one-shot drawings is almost closed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Bridge Implicit Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15885v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

| **[RelationBooth: Towards Relation-Aware Customized Object Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23280v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized image generation is crucial for delivering personalized content based on user-provided image prompts, aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with individual needs. However, existing models often overlook the relationships between customized objects in generated images. Instead, this work addresses that gap by focusing on relation-aware customized image generation, which aims to preserve the identities from image prompts while maintaining the predicate relations described in text prompts. Specifically, we introduce RelationBooth, a framework that disentangles identity and relation learning through a well-curated dataset. Our training data consists of relation-specific images, independent object images containing identity information, and text prompts to guide relation generation. Then, we propose two key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and natural relations, especially when significant pose adjustments are required, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we introduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in adjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we incorporate local features from the image prompts to better distinguish between objects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on three benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of RelationBooth in generating precise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of objects and relations. The source code and trained models will be made available to the public.</p></details> |  |

Data Scaling Laws for Ambient Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02780v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of generative models depends on the quality of the data they are trained on. Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets is often expensive and sometimes impossible, e.g. in certain scientific applications where there is no access to clean data due to physical or instrumentation constraints. Ambient Diffusion and related frameworks train diffusion models with solely corrupted data (which are usually cheaper to acquire) but ambient models significantly underperform models trained on clean data. We study this phenomenon at scale by training more than $80$ models on data with different corruption levels across three datasets ranging from $30,000$ to $\approx 1.3$M samples. We show that it is impossible, at these sample sizes, to match the performance of models trained on clean data when only training on noisy data. Yet, a combination of a small set of clean data (e.g.~$10\%$ of the total dataset) and a large set of highly noisy data suffices to reach the performance of models trained solely on similar-size datasets of clean data, and in particular to achieve near state-of-the-art performance. We provide theoretical evidence for our findings by developing novel sample complexity bounds for learning from Gaussian Mixtures with heterogeneous variances. Our theoretical model suggests that, for large enough datasets, the effective marginal utility of a noisy sample is exponentially worse than that of a clean sample. Providing a small set of clean samples can significantly reduce the sample size requirements for noisy data, as we also observe in our experiments.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, their iterative denoising process makes understanding and interpreting their semantic latent spaces more challenging than other generative models, such as GANs. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by identifying semantically meaningful directions within the latent space. However, they often need manual interpretation or are limited in the number of vectors that can be trained, restricting their scope and utility. This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised exploration of diffusion latent spaces. We directly leverage natural language prompts and image captions to map latent directions. This method allows for the automatic understanding of hidden features and supports a broader range of analysis without the need to train specific vectors. Our method provides a more scalable and interpretable understanding of the semantic knowledge encoded within diffusion models, facilitating comprehensive analysis of latent biases and the nuanced representations these models learn. Experimental results show that our framework can uncover hidden patterns and associations in various domains, offering new insights into the interpretability of diffusion model latent spaces.</p></details> |  |

While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner.

In audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE), there is not as much ground-truth clean data available; most audio-visual datasets are collected in real-world environments with background noise and reverberation, hampering the development of AVSE. In this work, we introduce AV2Wav, a resynthesis-based audio-visual speech enhancement approach that can generate clean speech despite the challenges of real-world training data. We obtain a subset of nearly clean speech from an audio-visual corpus using a neural quality estimator, and then train a diffusion model on this subset to generate waveforms conditioned on continuous speech representations from AV-HuBERT with noise-robust training. We use continuous rather than discrete representations to retain prosody and speaker information. With this vocoding task alone, the model can perform speech enhancement better than a masking-based baseline. We further fine-tune the diffusion model on clean/noisy utterance pairs to improve the performance. Our approach outperforms a masking-based baseline in terms of both automatic metrics and a human listening test and is close in quality to the target speech in the listening test.

In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</p></details> |  |

DAG generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic DAGs, which can be used for benchmarking computing systems while preserving intellectual property. However, generating realistic DAGs is challenging due to their inherent directional and logical dependencies. This paper introduces LayerDAG, an autoregressive diffusion model, to address these challenges. LayerDAG decouples the strong node dependencies into manageable units that can be processed sequentially. By interpreting the partial order of nodes as a sequence of bipartite graphs, LayerDAG leverages autoregressive generation to model directional dependencies and employs diffusion models to capture logical dependencies within each bipartite graph. Comparative analyses demonstrate that LayerDAG outperforms existing DAG generative models in both expressiveness and generalization, particularly for generating large-scale DAGs with up to 400 nodes-a critical scenario for system benchmarking. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world flow graphs from various computing platforms show that LayerDAG generates valid DAGs with superior statistical properties and benchmarking performance. The synthetic DAGs generated by LayerDAG enhance the training of ML-based surrogate models, resulting in improved accuracy in predicting performance metrics of real-world DAGs across diverse computing platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/LayerDAG</p></details> |

Image-based virtual try-on has shown impressive results; however, existing video virtual try-on (VVT) methods are still lacking garment details and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based architecture for video virtual try-on, split classifier-free guidance for increased control over the conditioning inputs, and a progressive temporal training strategy for single-pass 64-frame, 512px video generation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint image-video training for video try-on, especially when video data is limited.

Gaussian Splatting became widely adopted due to its efficiency and ability to render novel views accurately. While Gaussian Splatting performs well when a sufficient amount of training images are available, its unstructured explicit representation tends to overfit in scenarios with sparse input images, resulting in poor rendering performance. To address this, we present a 3D Gaussian-based novel view synthesis method using sparse input images that can accurately render the scene from the viewpoints not covered by the training images. We propose a multi-stage training scheme with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on the novel views without relying on pre-trained depth estimation or diffusion models. This is achieved by using the matches of the available training images to supervise the generation of the novel views sampled between the training frames with color, geometry, and semantic losses. In addition, we introduce a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians which removes rendering artifacts by preserving the local color structure of the scene. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance of our method in few-shot novel view synthesis compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

However, achieving visually coherent environment lighting estimation for Mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations associated with AR device sensing capabilities, including limitations in device camera FoV and pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address their key limitations of generation hallucination and slow inference process. To do so, in this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality and diverse environment maps in the format of 360$^\circ$ images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the results follow physical environment visual context and color appearances. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. To train and test our generative models, we curate a large-scale environment lighting estimation dataset with diverse lighting conditions. Through quantitative evaluation and user study, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy and robustness. Moreover, CleAR supports real-time refinement of lighting estimation results, ensuring robust and timely environment lighting updates for AR applications. Our end-to-end generative estimation takes as fast as 3.2 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 110x.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently utilize cross-dataset resources or rely on resource-intensive vision-language models, thus limiting their multi-task performance and practical applications. In this study, we propose a novel approach that decouples robot action trajectory encoding and control policy generation by leveraging latent action trajectory spaces, enhancing the generalization ability of policy generation on multi-task manipulation tasks. First, we pre-train a task-agnostic auto-encoder to project an action trajectory of several frames accompanied with observations into a latent action trajectory space on large-scale datasets collected with multiple embodiments in various environments. Then we propose learning a diffusion model based on the latent action trajectory space to generate actions of next steps. Through experiments on two widely used benchmarks, results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baselines by 7%-29% in terms of average success rate across eight tasks. Our method can consistently benefit from pre-training while baselines cannot. Our method is more than two times faster than our baseline.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling. Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09236</p></details> |

However, the robustness of watermarking techniques has not been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of generative watermarking, which is created from the integration of watermarking embedding and text-to-image generation processing in generative models, e.g., latent diffusion models. Specifically, we propose three attacking methods, i.e., discriminator-based attacks, edge prediction-based attacks, and fine-tune-based attacks, under the scenario where the watermark decoder is not accessible. The model is allowed to be fine-tuned to created AI agents with specific generative tasks for personalizing or specializing. We found that generative watermarking methods are robust to direct evasion attacks, like discriminator-based attacks, or manipulation based on the edge information in edge prediction-based attacks but vulnerable to malicious fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our fine-tune-based attacks can decrease the accuracy of the watermark detection to nearly $67.92\%$. In addition, We conduct an ablation study on the length of fine-tuned messages, encoder/decoder's depth and structure to identify key factors that impact the performance of fine-tune-based attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We fi...</summary><p>We find an error in one of the proposed attack methods, which significantly impact the correctness.

| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

| **[Model Integrity when Unlearning with T2I Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02068v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of text-to-image Diffusion Models has led to their widespread public accessibility. However these models, trained on large internet datasets, can sometimes generate undesirable outputs. To mitigate this, approximate Machine Unlearning algorithms have been proposed to modify model weights to reduce the generation of specific types of images, characterized by samples from a ``forget distribution'', while preserving the model's ability to generate other images, characterized by samples from a ``retain distribution''. While these methods aim to minimize the influence of training data in the forget distribution without extensive additional computation, we point out that they can compromise the model's integrity by inadvertently affecting generation for images in the retain distribution. Recognizing the limitations of FID and CLIPScore in capturing these effects, we introduce a novel retention metric that directly assesses the perceptual difference between outputs generated by the original and the unlearned models. We then propose unlearning algorithms that demonstrate superior effectiveness in preserving model integrity compared to existing baselines. Given their straightforward implementation, these algorithms serve as valuable benchmarks for future advancements in approximate Machine Unlearning for Diffusion Models.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that this memorization stems from the overparameterization of deep models and propose that regularizing model capacity during fine-tuning can mitigate this issue. Firstly, we empirically show that regulating the model capacity via Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mitigates memorization to some extent, however, it further requires the identification of the exact parameter subsets to be fine-tuned for high-quality generation. To identify these subsets, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework, MemControl, that automates parameter selection using memorization and generation quality metrics as rewards during fine-tuning. The parameter subsets discovered through MemControl achieve a superior tradeoff between generation quality and memorization. For the task of medical image generation, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art memorization mitigation strategies by fine-tuning as few as 0.019% of model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered parameter subsets are transferable to non-medical domains. Our framework is scalable to large datasets, agnostic to reward functions, and can be integrated with existing approaches for further memorization mitigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to empirically evaluate memorization in medical images and propose a targeted yet universal mitigation strategy.

| **[Finding NeMo: Localizing Neurons Responsible For Memorization in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02366v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) produce very detailed and high-quality images. Their power results from extensive training on large amounts of data, usually scraped from the internet without proper attribution or consent from content creators. Unfortunately, this practice raises privacy and intellectual property concerns, as DMs can memorize and later reproduce their potentially sensitive or copyrighted training images at inference time. Prior efforts prevent this issue by either changing the input to the diffusion process, thereby preventing the DM from generating memorized samples during inference, or removing the memorized data from training altogether. While those are viable solutions when the DM is developed and deployed in a secure and constantly monitored environment, they hold the risk of adversaries circumventing the safeguards and are not effective when the DM itself is publicly released. To solve the problem, we introduce NeMo, the first method to localize memorization of individual data samples down to the level of neurons in DMs' cross-attention layers. Through our experiments, we make the intriguing finding that in many cases, single neurons are responsible for memorizing particular training samples. By deactivating these memorization neurons, we can avoid the replication of training data at inference time, increase the diversity in the generated outputs, and mitigate the leakage of private and copyrighted data. In this way, our NeMo contributes to a more responsible deployment of DMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models as Network Optimizers: Explorations and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00453v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network optimization is a fundamental challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) network, often characterized by complex features that make it difficult to solve these problems. Recently, generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as a promising new approach to network optimization, with the potential to directly address these optimization problems. However, the application of GDMs in this field is still in its early stages, and there is a noticeable lack of theoretical research and empirical findings. In this study, we first explore the intrinsic characteristics of generative models. Next, we provide a concise theoretical proof and intuitive demonstration of the advantages of generative models over discriminative models in network optimization. Based on this exploration, we implement GDMs as optimizers aimed at learning high-quality solution distributions for given inputs, sampling from these distributions during inference to approximate or achieve optimal solutions. Specifically, we utilize denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and employ a classifier-free guidance mechanism to manage conditional guidance based on input parameters. We conduct extensive experiments across three challenging network optimization problems. By investigating various model configurations and the principles of GDMs as optimizers, we demonstrate the ability to overcome prediction errors and validate the convergence of generated solutions to optimal solutions.We provide code and data at https://github.com/qiyu3816/DiffSG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffuMask-Editor: A Novel Paradigm of Integration Between the Segmentation Diffusion Model and Image Editing to Improve Segmentation Ability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01819v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models, like mask2former, often demand a substantial amount of manually annotated data, which is time-consuming and inefficient to acquire. Leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an effective strategy for automatically generating synthetic data instead of human annotations. However, prior approaches have been constrained to synthesizing single-instance images due to the instability inherent in generating multiple instances with Stable Diffusion. To expand the domains and diversity of synthetic datasets, this paper introduces a novel paradigm named DiffuMask-Editor, which combines the Diffusion Model for Segmentation with Image Editing. By integrating multiple objects into images using Text2Image models, our method facilitates the creation of more realistic datasets that closely resemble open-world settings while simultaneously generating accurate masks. Our approach significantly reduces the laborious effort associated with manual annotation while ensuring precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by DiffuMask-Editor enable segmentation methods to achieve superior performance compared to real data. Particularly in zero-shot backgrounds, DiffuMask-Editor achieves new state-of-the-art results on Unseen classes of VOC 2012. The code and models will be publicly available soon.</p></details> | 13 pages,4 figures |

The interaction between human motion and music is a reflection of advanced human intelligence, and establishing a unified relationship between them is particularly important. However, to date, there has been no work that considers them jointly to explore the modality alignment within. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, termed MoMu-Diffusion, for long-term and synchronous motion-music generation. Firstly, to mitigate the huge computational costs raised by long sequences, we propose a novel Bidirectional Contrastive Rhythmic Variational Auto-Encoder (BiCoR-VAE) that extracts the modality-aligned latent representations for both motion and music inputs. Subsequently, leveraging the aligned latent spaces, we introduce a multi-modal Transformer-based diffusion model and a cross-guidance sampling strategy to enable various generation tasks, including cross-modal, multi-modal, and variable-length generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMu-Diffusion surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can synthesize realistic, diverse, long-term, and beat-matched music or motion sequences.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

In this paper, we present Make-An-Agent, a novel policy parameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation. Guided by behavior embeddings that encode trajectory information, our policy generator synthesizes latent parameter representations, which can then be decoded into policy networks. Trained on policy network checkpoints and their corresponding trajectories, our generation model demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and has a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed policies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs. We showcase its efficacy and efficiency on various domains and tasks, including varying objectives, behaviors, and even across different robot manipulators. Beyond simulation, we directly deploy policies generated by Make-An-Agent onto real-world robots on locomotion tasks.

| **[Neural Pose Representation Learning for Generating and Transferring Non-Rigid Object Poses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09728v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for learning representations of poses for 3D deformable objects, which specializes in 1) disentangling pose information from the object's identity, 2) facilitating the learning of pose variations, and 3) transferring pose information to other object identities. Based on these properties, our method enables the generation of 3D deformable objects with diversity in both identities and poses, using variations of a single object. It does not require explicit shape parameterization such as skeletons or joints, point-level or shape-level correspondence supervision, or variations of the target object for pose transfer. To achieve pose disentanglement, compactness for generative models, and transferability, we first design the pose extractor to represent the pose as a keypoint-based hybrid representation and the pose applier to learn an implicit deformation field. To better distill pose information from the object's geometry, we propose the implicit pose applier to output an intrinsic mesh property, the face Jacobian. Once the extracted pose information is transferred to the target object, the pose applier is fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to better describe the target object's shapes with pose variations. The extracted poses are also used to train a cascaded diffusion model to enable the generation of novel poses. Our experiments with the DeformThings4D and Human datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in pose transfer and the ability to generate diverse deformed shapes with various objects and poses.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Discrete-state Continuous-time Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11416v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph is a prevalent discrete data structure, whose generation has wide applications such as drug discovery and circuit design. Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to generation quality, and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks and, at the same time, can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[xDiT: an Inference Engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with Massive Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01738v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are pivotal for generating high-quality images and videos. Inspired by the success of OpenAI's Sora, the backbone of diffusion models is evolving from U-Net to Transformer, known as Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). However, generating high-quality content necessitates longer sequence lengths, exponentially increasing the computation required for the attention mechanism, and escalating DiTs inference latency. Parallel inference is essential for real-time DiTs deployments, but relying on a single parallel method is impractical due to poor scalability at large scales. This paper introduces xDiT, a comprehensive parallel inference engine for DiTs. After thoroughly investigating existing DiTs parallel approaches, xDiT chooses Sequence Parallel (SP) and PipeFusion, a novel Patch-level Pipeline Parallel method, as intra-image parallel strategies, alongside CFG parallel for inter-image parallelism. xDiT can flexibly combine these parallel approaches in a hybrid manner, offering a robust and scalable solution. Experimental results on two 8xL40 GPUs (PCIe) nodes interconnected by Ethernet and an 8xA100 (NVLink) node showcase xDiT's exceptional scalability across five state-of-the-art DiTs. Notably, we are the first to demonstrate DiTs scalability on Ethernet-connected GPU clusters. xDiT is available at https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrepGen: A B-rep Generative Diffusion Model with Structured Latent Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15563v3)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents BrepGen, a diffusion-based generative approach that directly outputs a Boundary representation (B-rep) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. BrepGen represents a B-rep model as a novel structured latent geometry in a hierarchical tree. With the root node representing a whole CAD solid, each element of a B-rep model (i.e., a face, an edge, or a vertex) progressively turns into a child-node from top to bottom. B-rep geometry information goes into the nodes as the global bounding box of each primitive along with a latent code describing the local geometric shape. The B-rep topology information is implicitly represented by node duplication. When two faces share an edge, the edge curve will appear twice in the tree, and a T-junction vertex with three incident edges appears six times in the tree with identical node features. Starting from the root and progressing to the leaf, BrepGen employs Transformer-based diffusion models to sequentially denoise node features while duplicated nodes are detected and merged, recovering the B-Rep topology information. Extensive experiments show that BrepGen advances the task of CAD B-rep generation, surpassing existing methods on various benchmarks. Results on our newly collected furniture dataset further showcase its exceptional capability in generating complicated geometry. While previous methods were limited to generating simple prismatic shapes, BrepGen incorporates free-form and doubly-curved surfaces for the first time. Additional applications of BrepGen include CAD autocomplete and design interpolation.

| **[Optical Flow Representation Alignment Mamba Diffusion Model for Medical Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01647v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical video generation models are expected to have a profound impact on the healthcare industry, including but not limited to medical education and training, surgical planning, and simulation. Current video diffusion models typically build on image diffusion architecture by incorporating temporal operations (such as 3D convolution and temporal attention). Although this approach is effective, its oversimplification limits spatio-temporal performance and consumes substantial computational resources. To counter this, we propose Medical Simulation Video Generator (MedSora), which incorporates three key elements: i) a video diffusion framework integrates the advantages of attention and Mamba, balancing low computational load with high-quality video generation, ii) an optical flow representation alignment method that implicitly enhances attention to inter-frame pixels, and iii) a video variational autoencoder (VAE) with frequency compensation addresses the information loss of medical features that occurs when transforming pixel space into latent features and then back to pixel frames. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that MedSora exhibits superior visual quality in generating medical videos, outperforming the most advanced baseline methods.

Despite the recent remarkable empirical advances in speeding up the score-based samplers, theoretical understanding of acceleration techniques remains largely limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel training-free acceleration scheme for stochastic samplers. Under minimal assumptions -- namely, $L^2$-accurate score estimates and a finite second-moment condition on the target distribution -- our accelerated sampler provably achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy in total variation within $\widetilde{O}(d^{5/4}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ iterations, thereby significantly improving upon the $\widetilde{O}(d/\varepsilon)$ iteration complexity of standard score-based samplers. Notably, our convergence theory does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the target distribution or higher-order score estimation guarantees.</p></details> |  |

Artificial intelligence methods have shown promise in enhancing CBCT quality to produce synthetic CT (sCT) images. However, existing methods either produce images of suboptimal quality or incur excessive time costs, failing to satisfy clinical practice standards. Methods and materials: We propose a novel hybrid conditional latent diffusion model for efficient and accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis, named HC$^3$L-Diff. We employ the Unified Feature Encoder (UFE) to compress images into a low-dimensional latent space, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Beyond the use of CBCT images, we propose integrating its high-frequency knowledge as a hybrid condition to guide the diffusion model in generating sCT images with preserved structural details. This high-frequency information is captured using our designed High-Frequency Extractor (HFE). During inference, we utilize denoising diffusion implicit model to facilitate rapid sampling. We construct a new in-house prostate dataset with paired CBCT and CT to validate the effectiveness of our method. Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sCT quality and generation efficiency. Moreover, our medical physicist conducts the dosimetric evaluations to validate the benefit of our method in practical dose calculation, achieving a remarkable 93.8% gamma passing rate with a 2%/2mm criterion, superior to other methods. Conclusion: The proposed HC$^3$L-Diff can efficiently achieve high-quality CBCT-to-CT synthesis in only over 2 mins per patient. Its promising performance in dose calculation shows great potential for enhancing real-world adaptive radiotherapy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which simultaneously processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner frames by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video examples and source codes are available at our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jjihwan.github.io/projects/FIFO-Diffusion</p></details> |

Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

To address this challenge, we introduce `Non-Cross Diffusion', an innovative approach in generative modeling for learning ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. Our methodology strategically incorporates an ascending dimension of input to effectively connect points sampled from two distributions with uncrossed paths. This design is pivotal in ensuring enhanced semantic consistency throughout the inference process, which is especially critical for applications reliant on consistent generative flows, including various distillation methods and deterministic sampling, which are fundamental in image editing and interpolation tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of Non-Cross Diffusion, showing a substantial reduction in semantic inconsistencies at different inference steps and a notable enhancement in the overall performance of diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Text Generation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14138v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, with the rapid advancements of generative models, the field of visual text generation has witnessed significant progress. However, it is still challenging to render high-quality text images in real-world scenarios, as three critical criteria should be satisfied: (1) Fidelity: the generated text images should be photo-realistic and the contents are expected to be the same as specified in the given conditions; (2) Reasonability: the regions and contents of the generated text should cohere with the scene; (3) Utility: the generated text images can facilitate related tasks (e.g., text detection and recognition). Upon investigation, we find that existing methods, either rendering-based or diffusion-based, can hardly meet all these aspects simultaneously, limiting their application range. Therefore, we propose in this paper a visual text generator (termed SceneVTG), which can produce high-quality text images in the wild. Following a two-stage paradigm, SceneVTG leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model to recommend reasonable text regions and contents across multiple scales and levels, which are used by a conditional diffusion model as conditions to generate text images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SceneVTG significantly outperforms traditional rendering-based methods and recent diffusion-based methods in terms of fidelity and reasonability. Besides, the generated images provide superior utility for tasks involving text detection and text recognition.

| **[Two-Timescale Model Caching and Resource Allocation for Edge-Enabled AI-Generated Content Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01458v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology, enabling customized and personalized AI-generated content (AIGC) services. In this paper, we address challenges of edge-enabled AIGC service provisioning, which remain underexplored in the literature. These services require executing GenAI models with billions of parameters, posing significant obstacles to resource-limited wireless edge. We subsequently introduce the formulation of joint model caching and resource allocation for AIGC services to balance a trade-off between AIGC quality and latency metrics. We obtain mathematical relationships of these metrics with the computational resources required by GenAI models via experimentation. Afterward, we decompose the formulation into a model caching subproblem on a long-timescale and a resource allocation subproblem on a short-timescale. Since the variables to be solved are discrete and continuous, respectively, we leverage a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm to solve the former subproblem and propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm to solve the latter. The proposed D3PG algorithm makes an innovative use of diffusion models as the actor network to determine optimal resource allocation decisions. Consequently, we integrate these two learning methods within the overarching two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) algorithm, the performance of which is studied through comparative numerical simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 39 references</p></details> |
| **[Guided Synthesis of Labeled Brain MRI Data Using Latent Diffusion Models for Segmentation of Enlarged Ventricles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01351v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models in medical contexts face challenges like data scarcity, inhomogeneity, and privacy concerns. This study focuses on improving ventricular segmentation in brain MRI images using synthetic data. We employed two latent diffusion models (LDMs): a mask generator trained using 10,000 masks, and a corresponding SPADE image generator optimized using 6,881 scans to create an MRI conditioned on a 3D brain mask. Conditioning the mask generator on ventricular volume in combination with classifier-free guidance enabled the control of the ventricular volume distribution of the generated synthetic images. Next, the performance of the synthetic data was tested using three nnU-Net segmentation models trained on a real, augmented and entirely synthetic data, respectively. The resulting models were tested on a completely independent hold-out dataset of patients with enlarged ventricles, with manual delineation of the ventricles used as ground truth. The model trained on real data showed a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.09 \pm 12.18 mL in predicted ventricular volume, while the models trained on synthetic and augmented data showed MAEs of 7.52 \pm 4.81 mL and 6.23 \pm 4.33 mL, respectively. Both the synthetic and augmented model also outperformed the state-of-the-art model SynthSeg, which due to limited performance in cases of large ventricular volumes, showed an MAE of 7.73 \pm 12.12 mL with a factor of 3 higher standard deviation. The model trained on augmented data showed the highest Dice score of 0.892 \pm 0.05, slightly outperforming SynthSeg and on par with the model trained on real data. The synthetic model performed similar to SynthSeg. In summary, we provide evidence that guided synthesis of labeled brain MRI data using LDMs improves the segmentation of enlarged ventricles and outperforms existing state-of-the-art segmentation models.</p></details> |  |

The Curious Case of High Density Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01293v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate what kind of images lie in the high-density regions of diffusion models. We introduce a theoretical mode-tracking process capable of pinpointing the exact mode of the denoising distribution, and we propose a practical high-probability sampler that consistently generates images of higher likelihood than usual samplers. Our empirical findings reveal the existence of significantly higher likelihood samples that typical samplers do not produce, often manifesting as cartoon-like drawings or blurry images depending on the noise level. Curiously, these patterns emerge in datasets devoid of such examples. We also present a novel approach to track sample likelihoods in diffusion SDEs, which remarkably incurs no additional computational cost.</p></details> |  |

Training-free noise-space manipulation has proven to be an effective technique, where the challenge is to preserve the Gaussian white noise distribution while adding in temporal consistency. Recently, Chang et al. (2024) formulated this problem using an integral noise representation with distribution-preserving guarantees, and proposed an upsampling-based algorithm to compute it. However, while their mathematical formulation is advantageous, the algorithm incurs a high computational cost. Through analyzing the limiting-case behavior of their algorithm as the upsampling resolution goes to infinity, we develop an alternative algorithm that, by gathering increments of multiple Brownian bridges, achieves their infinite-resolution accuracy while simultaneously reducing the computational cost by orders of magnitude. We prove and experimentally validate our theoretical claims, and demonstrate our method's effectiveness in real-world applications. We further show that our method readily extends to the 3-dimensional space.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an efficient LoRA-based personalization approach for on-device subject-driven generation, where pre-trained diffusion models are fine-tuned with user-specific data on resource-constrained devices. Our method, termed Hollowed Net, enhances memory efficiency during fine-tuning by modifying the architecture of a diffusion U-Net to temporarily remove a fraction of its deep layers, creating a hollowed structure. This approach directly addresses on-device memory constraints and substantially reduces GPU memory requirements for training, in contrast to previous methods that primarily focus on minimizing training steps and reducing the number of parameters to update. Additionally, the personalized Hollowed Net can be transferred back into the original U-Net, enabling inference without additional memory overhead. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our approach not only reduces training memory to levels as low as those required for inference but also maintains or improves personalization performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, current video diffusion models exhibit demanding computational requirements and high peak memory usage, especially for generating longer and higher-resolution videos. These limitations greatly hinder the practical application of video diffusion models on standard hardware platforms. To tackle this issue, we present a novel, training-free framework named Streamlined Inference, which leverages the temporal and spatial properties of video diffusion models. Our approach integrates three core components: Feature Slicer, Operator Grouping, and Step Rehash. Specifically, Feature Slicer effectively partitions input features into sub-features and Operator Grouping processes each sub-feature with a group of consecutive operators, resulting in significant memory reduction without sacrificing the quality or speed. Step Rehash further exploits the similarity between adjacent steps in diffusion, and accelerates inference through skipping unnecessary steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces peak memory and computational overhead, making it feasible to generate high-quality videos on a single consumer GPU (e.g., reducing peak memory of AnimateDiff from 42GB to 11GB, featuring faster inference on 2080Ti).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Tuning with Diffusion for Few-Shot Pre-trained Policy Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01168v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods harness previous experiences to derive an optimal policy, forming the foundation for pre-trained large-scale models (PLMs). When encountering tasks not seen before, PLMs often utilize several expert trajectories as prompts to expedite their adaptation to new requirements. Though a range of prompt-tuning methods have been proposed to enhance the quality of prompts, these methods often face optimization restrictions due to prompt initialization, which can significantly constrain the exploration domain and potentially lead to suboptimal solutions. To eliminate the reliance on the initial prompt, we shift our perspective towards the generative model, framing the prompt-tuning process as a form of conditional generative modeling, where prompts are generated from random noise. Our innovation, the Prompt Diffuser, leverages a conditional diffusion model to produce prompts of exceptional quality. Central to our framework is the approach to trajectory reconstruction and the meticulous integration of downstream task guidance during the training phase. Further experimental results underscore the potency of the Prompt Diffuser as a robust and effective tool for the prompt-tuning process, demonstrating strong performance in the meta-RL tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Specifically, instead of directly measuring the divergence with paired images, we train a reward model with the dataset we construct, consisting of nearly 51,000 images annotated with human preferences. Then, we adopt a reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model for image inpainting in the direction of higher reward. Moreover, we theoretically deduce the upper bound on the error of the reward model, which illustrates the potential confidence of reward estimation throughout the reinforcement alignment process, thereby facilitating accurate regularization. Extensive experiments on inpainting comparison and downstream tasks, such as image extension and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the alignment of inpainted images with human preference compared with state-of-the-art methods. This research not only advances the field of image inpainting but also provides a framework for incorporating human preference into the iterative refinement of generative models based on modeling reward accuracy, with broad implications for the design of visually driven AI applications.

| **[Supervised Score-Based Modeling by Gradient Boosting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01159v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based generative models can effectively learn the distribution of data by estimating the gradient of the distribution. Due to the multi-step denoising characteristic, researchers have recently considered combining score-based generative models with the gradient boosting algorithm, a multi-step supervised learning algorithm, to solve supervised learning tasks. However, existing generative model algorithms are often limited by the stochastic nature of the models and the long inference time, impacting prediction performances. Therefore, we propose a Supervised Score-based Model (SSM), which can be viewed as a gradient boosting algorithm combining score matching. We provide a theoretical analysis of learning and sampling for SSM to balance inference time and prediction accuracy. Via the ablation experiment in selected examples, we demonstrate the outstanding performances of the proposed techniques. Additionally, we compare our model with other probabilistic models, including Natural Gradient Boosting (NGboost), Classification and Regression Diffusion Models (CARD), Diffusion Boosted Trees (DBT), and Bayesian neural network-based models. The experimental results show that our model outperforms existing models in both accuracy and inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[RadioDiff: An Effective Generative Diffusion Model for Sampling-Free Dynamic Radio Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08593v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

Despite their success in modeling single-modality data marginal distribution, there is an under-exploration in the mutual reliance between different modalities to describe complex driving scenes. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel framework, X-DRIVE, to model the joint distribution of point clouds and multi-view images via a dual-branch latent diffusion model architecture. Considering the distinct geometrical spaces of the two modalities, X-DRIVE conditions the synthesis of each modality on the corresponding local regions from the other modality, ensuring better alignment and realism. To further handle the spatial ambiguity during denoising, we design the cross-modality condition module based on epipolar lines to adaptively learn the cross-modality local correspondence. Besides, X-DRIVE allows for controllable generation through multi-level input conditions, including text, bounding box, image, and point clouds. Extensive results demonstrate the high-fidelity synthetic results of X-DRIVE for both point clouds and multi-view images, adhering to input conditions while ensuring reliable cross-modality consistency. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yichen928/X-Drive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Noise Classifier and Benefits from Contrastive Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08946v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models learn to denoise data and the trained denoiser is then used to generate new samples from the data distribution. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions. This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution. We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on target environment lighting and estimated object geometry. We then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</p></details> |  |

The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem.

Additionally, many methods require supplementary data such as facial landmarks and masks to guide the synthesis process. In contrast, our approach uses diffusion models with only a reconstruction loss, eliminating the need for facial landmarks or masks while still producing images with intricate, fine-grained details. We validated our results on two public benchmarks through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three key areas: identity anonymization, facial attribute preservation, and image quality. Beyond its primary function of anonymization, our model can also perform face swapping tasks by incorporating an additional facial image as input, demonstrating its versatility and potential for diverse applications.

Previous research has demonstrated that adversarial prompts can be used to generate NSFW content. However, such adversarial text prompts are often easily detectable by text-based filters, limiting their efficacy. In this paper, we expose a previously overlooked vulnerability: adversarial image attacks targeting Image-to-Image (I2I) diffusion models. We propose AdvI2I, a novel framework that manipulates input images to induce diffusion models to generate NSFW content. By optimizing a generator to craft adversarial images, AdvI2I circumvents existing defense mechanisms, such as Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD), without altering the text prompts. Furthermore, we introduce AdvI2I-Adaptive, an enhanced version that adapts to potential countermeasures and minimizes the resemblance between adversarial images and NSFW concept embeddings, making the attack more resilient against defenses. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that both AdvI2I and AdvI2I-Adaptive can effectively bypass current safeguards, highlighting the urgent need for stronger security measures to address the misuse of I2I diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion models and energy-based models, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Rather than returning just one hypothesis of that image, posterior samplers aim to explore the full solution space by generating many probable hypotheses, which can later be used to quantify uncertainty or construct recoveries that appropriately navigate the perception/distortion trade-off. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate posterior-sampling conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that, through a novel form of regularization, aims for correctness in the posterior mean as well as the trace and K principal components of the posterior covariance matrix.

It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play "online" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time.

However, these advanced models rely heavily on high-quality, diverse datasets, often limited and costly in agricultural settings. Traditional data augmentation can increase dataset volume but usually lacks the real-world variability needed for robust training. This study presents a new approach for generating synthetic images to improve deep learning-based object detection models for intelligent weed control. Our GenAI-based image generation pipeline integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for zero-shot domain adaptation with a text-to-image Stable Diffusion Model, enabling the creation of synthetic images that capture diverse real-world conditions. We evaluate these synthetic datasets using lightweight YOLO models, measuring data efficiency with mAP50 and mAP50-95 scores across varying proportions of real and synthetic data. Notably, YOLO models trained on datasets with 10% synthetic and 90% real images generally demonstrate superior mAP50 and mAP50-95 scores compared to those trained solely on real images. This approach not only reduces dependence on extensive real-world datasets but also enhances predictive performance. The integration of this approach opens opportunities for achieving continual self-improvement of perception modules in intelligent technical systems.</p></details> |  |

Most diffusion-based studies on video motion focus on motion customization with training-based paradigms, which, however, demands substantial training resources and necessitates retraining for diverse models. Crucially, these approaches do not explore how video diffusion models encode cross-frame motion information in their features, lacking interpretability and transparency in their effectiveness. To answer this question, this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand, localize, and manipulate motion-aware features in video diffusion models. Through analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our work discloses that robust motion-aware feature already exists in video diffusion models. We present a new MOtion FeaTure (MOFT) by eliminating content correlation information and filtering motion channels. MOFT provides a distinct set of benefits, including the ability to encode comprehensive motion information with clear interpretability, extraction without the need for training, and generalizability across diverse architectures. Leveraging MOFT, we propose a novel training-free video motion control framework. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in generating natural and faithful motion, providing architecture-agnostic insights and applicability in a variety of downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xizaoqu.github.io/moft/</p></details> |
| **[Conditional GAN for Enhancing Diffusion Models in Efficient and Authentic Global Gesture Generation from Audios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20359v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven simultaneous gesture generation is vital for human-computer communication, AI games, and film production. While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'2024, 10 pages</p></details> |

Although diffusion-based 3D texture generation methods, such as distillation sampling, have numerous promising applications in stylized games and films, it requires addressing two challenges: 1) decouple style and content completely from the reference image for 3D models, and 2) align the generated texture with the color tone, style of the reference image, and the given text prompt. To this end, we introduce StyleTex, an innovative diffusion-model-based framework for creating stylized textures for 3D models. Our key insight is to decouple style information from the reference image while disregarding content in diffusion-based distillation sampling. Specifically, given a reference image, we first decompose its style feature from the image CLIP embedding by subtracting the embedding's orthogonal projection in the direction of the content feature, which is represented by a text CLIP embedding. Our novel approach to disentangling the reference image's style and content information allows us to generate distinct style and content features. We then inject the style feature into the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate it into the generation process, while utilizing the content feature as a negative prompt to further dissociate content information. Finally, we incorporate these strategies into StyleTex to obtain stylized textures. The resulting textures generated by StyleTex retain the style of the reference image, while also aligning with the text prompts and intrinsic details of the given 3D mesh. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing baseline methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Siggraph Asia 2024</p></details> |

However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00359v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes an efficient algorithm for solving noisy linear inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models. Extending the paradigm of denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), we propose constrained diffusion implicit models (CDIM) that modify the diffusion updates to enforce a constraint upon the final output. For noiseless inverse problems, CDIM exactly satisfies the constraints; in the noisy case, we generalize CDIM to satisfy an exact constraint on the residual distribution of the noise. Experiments across a variety of tasks and metrics show strong performance of CDIM, with analogous inference acceleration to unconstrained DDIM: 10 to 50 times faster than previous conditional diffusion methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach on many problems including super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and 3D point cloud reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion models face challenges in processing and fusing information from multiple images and lack access to high-quality publicly available datasets, which prevents the application of diffusion models in food image composition. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, high-quality food image composite dataset, FC22k, which comprises 22,000 foreground, background, and ground truth ternary image pairs. Additionally, we propose a novel food image composition method, Foodfusion, which leverages the capabilities of the pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates a Fusion Module for processing and integrating foreground and background information. This fused information aligns the foreground features with the background structure by merging the global structural information at the cross-attention layer of the denoising UNet. To further enhance the content and structure of the background, we also integrate a Content-Structure Control Module. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In particular, we focus on the scenarios where we do not have the full knowledge of the scene necessary to apply classical solvers. Most existing forward or inverse PDE approaches perform poorly when the observations on the data or the underlying coefficients are incomplete, which is a common assumption for real-world measurements. In this work, we propose DiffusionPDE that can simultaneously fill in the missing information and solve a PDE by modeling the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces. We show that the learned generative priors lead to a versatile framework for accurately solving a wide range of PDEs under partial observation, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for both forward and inverse directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contribute equally.

| **[Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09614v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[E(3)-invariant diffusion model for pocket-aware peptide generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21335v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biologists frequently desire protein inhibitors for a variety of reasons, including use as research tools for understanding biological processes and application to societal problems in agriculture, healthcare, etc. Immunotherapy, for instance, relies on immune checkpoint inhibitors to block checkpoint proteins, preventing their binding with partner proteins and boosting immune cell function against abnormal cells. Inhibitor discovery has long been a tedious process, which in recent years has been accelerated by computational approaches. Advances in artificial intelligence now provide an opportunity to make inhibitor discovery smarter than ever before. While extensive research has been conducted on computer-aided inhibitor discovery, it has mainly focused on either sequence-to-structure mapping, reverse mapping, or bio-activity prediction, making it unrealistic for biologists to utilize such tools. Instead, our work proposes a new method of computer-assisted inhibitor discovery: de novo pocket-aware peptide structure and sequence generation network. Our approach consists of two sequential diffusion models for end-to-end structure generation and sequence prediction. By leveraging angle and dihedral relationships between backbone atoms, we ensure an E(3)-invariant representation of peptide structures. Our results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, highlighting its potential in pocket-aware peptide design. This work offers a new approach for precise drug discovery using receptor-specific peptide generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Policies creating a Trust Region for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19690v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) leverages pre-collected datasets to train optimal policies. Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL), introducing diffusion models as a powerful and expressive policy class, significantly boosts the performance of offline RL. However, its reliance on iterative denoising sampling to generate actions slows down both training and inference. While several recent attempts have tried to accelerate diffusion-QL, the improvement in training and/or inference speed often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we introduce a dual policy approach, Diffusion Trusted Q-Learning (DTQL), which comprises a diffusion policy for pure behavior cloning and a practical one-step policy. We bridge the two polices by a newly introduced diffusion trust region loss. The diffusion policy maintains expressiveness, while the trust region loss directs the one-step policy to explore freely and seek modes within the region defined by the diffusion policy. DTQL eliminates the need for iterative denoising sampling during both training and inference, making it remarkably computationally efficient. We evaluate its effectiveness and algorithmic characteristics against popular Kullback--Leibler divergence-based distillation methods in 2D bandit scenarios and gym tasks. We then show that DTQL could not only outperform other methods on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks but also demonstrate efficiency in training and inference speeds. The PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/Diffusion_Trusted_Q_Learning.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel framework for solving the object goal navigation problem that generates efficient exploration strategies. Our approach enables a robot to navigate unfamiliar environments by leveraging LLMs and LVLMs to understand the semantic structure of the scene. To address the challenge of representing complex environments without overwhelming the system, we propose a 3D modular scene representation, enriched with semantic descriptions. This representation is dynamically pruned using an LLM-based mechanism, which filters irrelevant information and focuses on task-specific data. By combining these elements, our system generates high-level sub-goals that guide the exploration of the robot toward the target object. We validate our approach in simulated environments, demonstrating its ability to enhance object search efficiency while maintaining scalability in complex settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[HumanVLM: Foundation for Human-Scene Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03034v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-scene vision-language tasks are increasingly prevalent in diverse social applications, yet recent advancements predominantly rely on models specifically tailored to individual tasks. Emerging research indicates that large vision-language models (VLMs) can enhance performance across various downstream vision-language understanding tasks. However, general-domain models often underperform in specialized fields. This study introduces a domain-specific Large Vision-Language Model, Human-Scene Vision-Language Model (HumanVLM), designed to provide a foundation for human-scene Vision-Language tasks. Specifically, (1) we create a large-scale human-scene multimodal image-text dataset (HumanCaption-10M) sourced from the Internet to facilitate domain-specific alignment; (2) develop a captioning approach for human-centered images, capturing human faces, bodies, and backgrounds, and construct a high-quality Human-Scene image-text dataset (HumanCaptionHQ, about 311k pairs) that contain as much detailed information as possible about human; (3) Using HumanCaption-10M and HumanCaptionHQ, we train a HumanVLM. In the experiments, we then evaluate our HumanVLM across varous downstream tasks, where it demonstrates superior overall performance among multimodal models of comparable scale, particularly excelling in human-related tasks and significantly outperforming similar models, including Qwen2VL and ChatGPT-4o. HumanVLM, alongside the data introduced, will stimulate the research in human-around fields.</p></details> | 34 pages,11 figures |

However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

VHM is built on a large-scale remote sensing image-text dataset with rich-content captions (VersaD), and an honest instruction dataset comprising both factual and deceptive questions (HnstD). Unlike prevailing remote sensing image-text datasets, in which image captions focus on a few prominent objects and their relationships, VersaD captions provide detailed information about image properties, object attributes, and the overall scene. This comprehensive captioning enables VHM to thoroughly understand remote sensing images and perform diverse remote sensing tasks. Moreover, different from existing remote sensing instruction datasets that only include factual questions, HnstD contains additional deceptive questions stemming from the non-existence of objects. This feature prevents VHM from producing affirmative answers to nonsense queries, thereby ensuring its honesty. In our experiments, VHM significantly outperforms various vision language models on common tasks of scene classification, visual question answering, and visual grounding. Additionally, VHM achieves competent performance on several unexplored tasks, such as building vectorizing, multi-label classification and honest question answering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution: Chao Pang, Xingxing Weng, Jiang Wu; Corresponding author: Gui-Song Xia, Conghui He</p></details> |

Traditional AFR methods, which rely on predefined geometric rules and large datasets, are often time-consuming and lack generalizability across various manufacturing features. To address these challenges, this study investigates vision-language models (VLMs) for automating the recognition of a wide range of manufacturing features in CAD designs without the need for extensive training datasets or predefined rules. Instead, prompt engineering techniques, such as multi-view query images, few-shot learning, sequential reasoning, and chain-of-thought, are applied to enable recognition. The approach is evaluated on a newly developed CAD dataset containing designs of varying complexity relevant to machining, additive manufacturing, sheet metal forming, molding, and casting. Five VLMs, including three closed-source models (GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Claude-3.0-Opus) and two open-source models (LLava and MiniCPM), are evaluated on this dataset with ground truth features labelled by experts. Key metrics include feature quantity accuracy, feature name matching accuracy, hallucination rate, and mean absolute error (MAE). Results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the highest feature quantity accuracy (74%) and name-matching accuracy (75%) with the lowest MAE (3.2), while GPT-4o records the lowest hallucination rate (8%). In contrast, open-source models have higher hallucination rates (>30%) and lower accuracies (<40%). This study demonstrates the potential of VLMs to automate feature recognition in CAD designs within diverse manufacturing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has been submitted to The ASME Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering (JCISE)</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Multimodal Evaluation with Flexible Complexity by Vision-Language Bootstrapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08695v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Critic: Design Data Before Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02753v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As medical datasets rapidly expand, creating detailed annotations of different body structures becomes increasingly expensive and time-consuming. We consider that requesting radiologists to create detailed annotations is unnecessarily burdensome and that pre-existing AI models can largely automate this process. Following the spirit don't use a sledgehammer on a nut, we find that, rather than creating annotations from scratch, radiologists only have to review and edit errors if the Best-AI Labels have mistakes. To obtain the Best-AI Labels among multiple AI Labels, we developed an automatic tool, called Label Critic, that can assess label quality through tireless pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when incorporated with our developed Image-Prompt pairs, pre-existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM), trained on natural images and texts, achieve 96.5% accuracy when choosing the best label in a pair-wise comparison, without extra fine-tuning. By transforming the manual annotation task (30-60 min/scan) into an automatic comparison task (15 sec/scan), we effectively reduce the manual efforts required from radiologists by an order of magnitude. When the Best-AI Labels are sufficiently accurate (81% depending on body structures), they will be directly adopted as the gold-standard annotations for the dataset, with lower-quality AI Labels automatically discarded. Label Critic can also check the label quality of a single AI Label with 71.8% accuracy when no alternatives are available for comparison, prompting radiologists to review and edit if the estimated quality is low (19% depending on body structures).</p></details> |  |
| **[POINTS: Improving Your Vision-language Model with Affordable Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04828v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, vision-language models have made significant strides, excelling in tasks like optical character recognition and geometric problem-solving. However, several critical issues remain: 1) Proprietary models often lack transparency about their architectures, while open-source models need more detailed ablations of their training strategies. 2) Pre-training data in open-source works is under-explored, with datasets added empirically, making the process cumbersome. 3) Fine-tuning often focuses on adding datasets, leading to diminishing returns. To address these issues, we propose the following contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest advancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and conducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2) Inspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data using perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training. This approach allowed us to train on a curated 1M dataset, achieving competitive performance. 3) During visual instruction tuning, we used model soup on different datasets when adding more datasets yielded marginal improvements. These innovations resulted in a 9B parameter model that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our strategies are efficient and lightweight, making them easily adoptable by the community.</p></details> | v2 |

However, CLIP suffers from a two-level misalignment issue, i.e., task misalignment and data misalignment, when adapting to specific tasks. Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task misalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the impacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation processes of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while we expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately, the task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the modeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted classes. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the front-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks and perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction generated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different settings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite being simple and effective, this method results in sub-optimal cross-modal alignment by over-emphasizing the text tokens that are less correlated with or even contradictory with the input images. In this paper, we advocate for assigning distinct contributions for each text token based on its visual correlation. Specifically, we present by contrasting image inputs, the difference in prediction logits on each text token provides strong guidance of visual correlation. We therefore introduce Contrastive ALignment (CAL), a simple yet effective re-weighting strategy that prioritizes training visually correlated tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAL consistently improves different types of VLMs across different resolutions and model sizes on various benchmark datasets. Importantly, our method incurs minimal additional computational overhead, rendering it highly efficient compared to alternative data scaling strategies.

Since LVLMs are prone to hallucinations and there are currently few datasets and evaluation methods specifically designed for remote sensing, their performance is typically poor when applied to remote sensing tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces a high quality remote sensing LVLMs dataset, DDFAV, created using data augmentation and data mixing strategies. Next, a training instruction set is produced based on some high-quality remote sensing images selected from the proposed dataset. Finally, we develop a remote sensing LVLMs hallucination evaluation method RSPOPE based on the proposed dataset and evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of different LVLMs. Our proposed dataset, instruction set, and evaluation method files are available at https://github.com/HaodongLi2024/rspope.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |

Recent research indicates that the over-reliance on the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, as one cause of the LVLM hallucination, inherently introduces bias from language priors, leading to insufficient context attention to the visual inputs. We tackle this issue of hallucination by mitigating such over-reliance through preference learning. We propose Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) to enhance visual context learning at training time. To interpret the effectiveness and generalizability of V-DPO on different types of training data, we construct a synthetic dataset containing both response- and image-contrast preference pairs, compared against existing human-annotated hallucination samples. Our approach achieves significant improvements compared with baseline methods across various hallucination benchmarks. Our analysis indicates that V-DPO excels in learning from image-contrast preference data, demonstrating its superior ability to elicit and understand nuances of visual context. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiXie/V-DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Findings; 9 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables (16 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Continual LLaVA: Continual Instruction Tuning in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02564v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning constitutes a prevalent technique for tailoring Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to meet individual task requirements. To date, most of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas the requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually evolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the face of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging capabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl inStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned domain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental configurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a rehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To circumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze LVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to facilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings can be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment embeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up a low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the relevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2) contextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across tasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are aggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual instruction tuning process.</p></details> |  |
| **[INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02537v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed to challenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research.

| **[One VLM to Keep it Learning: Generation and Balancing for Data-free Continual Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02210v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant promise in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks by leveraging web-scale multimodal datasets. However, these models often struggle with continual learning due to catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new tasks. As an effective remedy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, rehearsal strategy uses the data of past tasks upon learning new task. However, such strategy incurs the need of storing past data, which might not be feasible due to hardware constraints or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose the first data-free method that leverages the language generation capability of a VLM, instead of relying on external models, to produce pseudo-rehearsal data for addressing continual VQA. Our proposal, named as GaB, generates pseudo-rehearsal data by posing previous task questions on new task data. Yet, despite being effective, the distribution of generated questions skews towards the most frequently posed questions due to the limited and task-specific training data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a pseudo-rehearsal balancing module that aligns the generated data towards the ground-truth data distribution using either the question meta-statistics or an unsupervised clustering method. We evaluate our proposed method on two recent benchmarks, \ie VQACL-VQAv2 and CLOVE-function benchmarks. GaB outperforms all the data-free baselines with substantial improvement in maintaining VQA performance across evolving tasks, while being on-par with methods with access to the past data.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoLD: Robot Latent Diffusion for Multi-task Policy Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07312v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling generalized robot control policies poses ongoing challenges for language-guided robot manipulation tasks. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently utilize cross-dataset resources or rely on resource-intensive vision-language models, thus limiting their multi-task performance and practical applications. In this study, we propose a novel approach that decouples robot action trajectory encoding and control policy generation by leveraging latent action trajectory spaces, enhancing the generalization ability of policy generation on multi-task manipulation tasks. First, we pre-train a task-agnostic auto-encoder to project an action trajectory of several frames accompanied with observations into a latent action trajectory space on large-scale datasets collected with multiple embodiments in various environments. Then we propose learning a diffusion model based on the latent action trajectory space to generate actions of next steps. Through experiments on two widely used benchmarks, results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baselines by 7%-29% in terms of average success rate across eight tasks. Our method can consistently benefit from pre-training while baselines cannot. Our method is more than two times faster than our baseline.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of transferring features from known to unknown classes while mitigating model bias, we introduce GraphVL, a novel approach for vision-language modeling in GCD, leveraging CLIP. Our method integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) with CLIP's text encoder to preserve class neighborhood structure. We also employ a lightweight visual projector for image data, ensuring discriminative features through margin-based contrastive losses for image-text mapping. This neighborhood preservation criterion effectively regulates the semantic space, making it less sensitive to known classes. Additionally, we learn textual prompts from known classes and align them to create a more contextually meaningful semantic feature space for the GCN layer using a contextual similarity loss. Finally, we represent unlabeled samples based on their semantic distance to class prompts from the GCN, enabling semi-supervised clustering for class discovery and minimizing errors. Our experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of GraphVL when integrated with the CLIP backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM ICVGIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Private Attribute Inference from Images with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10618v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous in our daily tasks and digital interactions, associated privacy risks are increasingly in focus. While LLM privacy research has primarily focused on the leakage of model training data, it has recently been shown that LLMs can make accurate privacy-infringing inferences from previously unseen texts. With the rise of vision-language models (VLMs), capable of understanding both images and text, a key question is whether this concern transfers to the previously unexplored domain of benign images posted online. To answer this question, we compile an image dataset with human-annotated labels of the image owner's personal attributes. In order to understand the privacy risks posed by VLMs beyond traditional human attribute recognition, our dataset consists of images where the inferable private attributes do not stem from direct depictions of humans. On this dataset, we evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs, finding that they can infer various personal attributes at up to 77.6% accuracy. Concerningly, we observe that accuracy scales with the general capabilities of the models, implying that future models can be misused as stronger inferential adversaries, establishing an imperative for the development of adequate defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[VGA: Vision GUI Assistant -- Minimizing Hallucinations through Image-Centric Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14056v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly improve performance in image comprehension tasks, such as formatted charts and rich-content images. Yet, Graphical User Interface (GUI) pose a greater challenge due to their structured format and detailed textual information. Existing LVLMs often overly depend on internal knowledge and neglect image content, resulting in hallucinations and incorrect responses in GUI comprehension. To address these issues, we introduce VGA, a fine-tuned model designed for comprehensive GUI understanding. Our model aims to enhance the interpretation of visual data of GUI and reduce hallucinations. We first construct a Vision Question Answering (VQA) dataset of 63.8k high-quality examples with our propose Referent Method, which ensures the model's responses are highly depend on visual content within the image. We then design a two-stage fine-tuning method called Foundation and Advanced Comprehension (FAC) to enhance both the model's ability to extract information from image content and alignment with human intent. Experiments show that our approach enhances the model's ability to extract information from images and achieves state-of-the-art results in GUI understanding tasks. Our dataset and fine-tuning script will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2024</p></details> |

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[CVQA: Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05967v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an important task in multimodal AI, and it is often used to test the ability of vision-language models to understand and reason on knowledge present in both visual and textual data. However, most of the current VQA models use datasets that are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are typically Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, although these datasets often extend their linguistic range via translation or some other approaches, they usually keep images the same, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we construct CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark, designed to cover a rich set of languages and cultures, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. As a result, CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 30 countries on four continents, covering 31 languages with 13 scripts, providing a total of 10k questions. We then benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark can serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural capability and bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts toward increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

However, the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs remains unverified, posing significant risks for future model deployment. In this paper, we introduce CARES and aim to comprehensively evaluate the Trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across the medical domain. We assess the trustworthiness of Med-LVLMs across five dimensions, including trustfulness, fairness, safety, privacy, and robustness. CARES comprises about 41K question-answer pairs in both closed and open-ended formats, covering 16 medical image modalities and 27 anatomical regions. Our analysis reveals that the models consistently exhibit concerns regarding trustworthiness, often displaying factual inaccuracies and failing to maintain fairness across different demographic groups. Furthermore, they are vulnerable to attacks and demonstrate a lack of privacy awareness.

Current robotic systems can handle known failures with pre-existing recovery strategies, but they are often ill-equipped to manage unknown failures or anomalies. We introduce VLMs as a monitoring tool to detect and identify failures during task execution. Additionally, VLMs generate missing conditions or skill templates that are then incorporated into the BT, ensuring the system can autonomously address similar failures in future tasks. We validate our approach through simulations in several failure scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integration of Large Vision Language Models for Efficient Post-disaster Damage Assessment and Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01511v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a new avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, the first multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core model, DisasTeller autonomously implements disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and optimising resource distribution. Our evaluations through both LVLMs and humans demonstrate DisasTeller's effectiveness in streamlining disaster response. This framework not only supports expert teams but also simplifies access to disaster management processes for non-experts, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and LVLM-driven efficiency.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Unified Triplet-Level Hallucination Evaluation for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23114v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, in this paper we design a unified framework to measure object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to conduct hallucination evaluation on (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, and thus, could be easily generalized to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE and observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple yet effective training-free approach to mitigate hallucinations for LVLMs, with which, we exceed all open-sourced counterparts on Tri-HE, achieving comparable performance with the powerful GPT-4V.

| **[A Visual Question Answering Method for SAR Ship: Breaking the Requirement for Multimodal Dataset Construction and Model Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01445v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current visual question answering (VQA) tasks often require constructing multimodal datasets and fine-tuning visual language models, which demands significant time and resources. This has greatly hindered the application of VQA to downstream tasks, such as ship information analysis based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel VQA approach that integrates object detection networks with visual language models, specifically designed for analyzing ships in SAR images. This integration aims to enhance the capabilities of VQA systems, focusing on aspects such as ship location, density, and size analysis, as well as risk behavior detection. Initially, we conducted baseline experiments using YOLO networks on two representative SAR ship detection datasets, SSDD and HRSID, to assess each model's performance in terms of detection accuracy. Based on these results, we selected the optimal model, YOLOv8n, as the most suitable detection network for this task. Subsequently, leveraging the vision-language model Qwen2-VL, we designed and implemented a VQA task specifically for SAR scenes. This task employs the ship location and size information output by the detection network to generate multi-turn dialogues and scene descriptions for SAR imagery. Experimental results indicate that this method not only enables fundamental SAR scene question-answering without the need for additional datasets or fine-tuning but also dynamically adapts to complex, multi-turn dialogue requirements, demonstrating robust semantic understanding and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this work, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure and prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotations for the human annotators, while for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with our CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by WACV 2025.

For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with "zero" temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10x faster and 13x more memory-friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field.

Unlike the large language model (LLM)-based methods which rely on structured texts and customized backends, the approaches using large vision-language models (LVLMs) are more intuitive and adaptable as they can visually perceive and directly interact with screens, making them indispensable in general scenarios without text metadata and tailored backends. Given the lack of high-quality training data for GUI-related tasks in existing work, this paper aims to enhance the GUI understanding and interacting capabilities of LVLMs through a data-driven approach. We propose EDGE, a general data synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale, multi-granularity training data from webpages across the Web. Evaluation results on various GUI and agent benchmarks demonstrate that the model trained with the dataset generated through EDGE exhibits superior webpage understanding capabilities, which can then be easily transferred to previously unseen desktop and mobile environments. Our approach significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotations, empowering researchers to harness the vast public resources available on the Web to advance their work. Our source code, the dataset and the model are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EDGE-1CDB.</p></details> |  |
| **[TypeScore: A Text Fidelity Metric for Text-to-Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02437v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating text-to-image generative models remains a challenge, despite the remarkable progress being made in their overall performances. While existing metrics like CLIPScore work for coarse evaluations, they lack the sensitivity to distinguish finer differences as model performance rapidly improves. In this work, we focus on the text rendering aspect of these models, which provides a lens for evaluating a generative model's fine-grained instruction-following capabilities. To this end, we introduce a new evaluation framework called TypeScore to sensitively assess a model's ability to generate images with high-fidelity embedded text by following precise instructions. We argue that this text generation capability serves as a proxy for general instruction-following ability in image synthesis. TypeScore uses an additional image description model and leverages an ensemble dissimilarity measure between the original and extracted text to evaluate the fidelity of the rendered text. Our proposed metric demonstrates greater resolution than CLIPScore to differentiate popular image generation models across a range of instructions with diverse text styles. Our study also evaluates how well these vision-language models (VLMs) adhere to stylistic instructions, disentangling style evaluation from embedded-text fidelity. Through human evaluation studies, we quantitatively meta-evaluate the effectiveness of the metric. Comprehensive analysis is conducted to explore factors such as text length, captioning models, and current progress towards human parity on this task. The framework provides insights into remaining gaps in instruction-following for image generation with embedded text.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Sober Look at the Robustness of CLIPs to Spurious Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11497v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive robustness to spurious features than single-modal models trained on ImageNet. However, existing test datasets are typically curated based on ImageNet-trained models, which aim to capture the spurious features inherited in ImageNet. Benchmarking CLIP models based on the ImageNet-oriented spurious features may not be sufficient to reflect the extent to which CLIP models are robust to spurious correlations within CLIP training data, e.g., LAION. To this end, we craft a new challenging dataset named CounterAnimal designed to reveal the reliance of CLIP models on realistic spurious features. Specifically, we split animal photos into groups according to the backgrounds, and then identify a pair of groups for each class where a CLIP model shows high-performance drops across the two groups. Our evaluations show that the spurious features captured by CounterAnimal are generically learned by CLIP models with different backbones and pre-train data, yet have limited influence for ImageNet models. We provide theoretical insights that the CLIP objective cannot offer additional robustness. Furthermore, we also re-evaluate strategies such as scaling up parameters and high-quality pre-trained data. We find that they still help mitigate the spurious features, providing a promising path for future developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024; Qizhou Wang, Yong Lin, and Yongqiang Chen contributed equally; Project page: https://counteranimal.github.io</p></details> |
| **[$π_0$: A Vision-Language-Action Flow Model for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24164v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning holds tremendous promise to unlock the full potential of flexible, general, and dexterous robot systems, as well as to address some of the deepest questions in artificial intelligence. However, bringing robot learning to the level of generality required for effective real-world systems faces major obstacles in terms of data, generalization, and robustness. In this paper, we discuss how generalist robot policies (i.e., robot foundation models) can address these challenges, and how we can design effective generalist robot policies for complex and highly dexterous tasks. We propose a novel flow matching architecture built on top of a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to inherit Internet-scale semantic knowledge. We then discuss how this model can be trained on a large and diverse dataset from multiple dexterous robot platforms, including single-arm robots, dual-arm robots, and mobile manipulators. We evaluate our model in terms of its ability to perform tasks in zero shot after pre-training, follow language instructions from people and from a high-level VLM policy, and its ability to acquire new skills via fine-tuning. Our results cover a wide variety of tasks, such as laundry folding, table cleaning, and assembling boxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>See p...</summary><p>See project website for videos: https://physicalintelligence.company/blog/pi0</p></details> |
| **[Bridge the Modality and Capability Gaps in Vision-Language Model Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13797v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot image classification by pairing images with textual category names. The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. To better reuse the VLM resource and fully leverage its potential on different zero-shot image classification tasks, a promising strategy is selecting appropriate Pre-Trained VLMs from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset's images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the "Modality Gap" - the disparity in VLM's embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the "Capability Gap" - the discrepancy between the VLM's overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model's dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source and target datasets with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging two gaps. By bridging two gaps to obtain better substitutes for test images, SWAB can accurately predict the performance ranking of different VLMs on the target task without the need for the dataset's images. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrated Self-Rewarding Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14622v4)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some experiments and charts, and redrew some figures V4</p></details> |

However, several pain points persist for this paradigm: (i) directly tuning entire pre-trained models becomes both time-intensive and computationally costly. Additionally, these tuned models tend to become highly specialized, limiting their practicality for real-world deployment; (ii) recent studies indicate that pre-trained vision-language classifiers may overly depend on spurious features -- patterns that correlate with the target in training data, but are not related to the true labeling function; and (iii) existing studies on mitigating the reliance on spurious features, largely based on the assumption that we can identify such features, does not provide definitive assurance for real-world applications. As a piloting study, this work focuses on exploring mitigating the reliance on spurious features for CLIP without using any group annotation. To this end, we systematically study the existence of spurious correlation on CLIP and CLIP+ERM. We first, following recent work on Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR), verify that last-layer retraining can greatly improve group robustness on pretrained CLIP. In view of them, we advocate a lightweight representation calibration method for fine-tuning CLIP, by first generating a calibration set using the pretrained CLIP, and then calibrating representations of samples within this set through contrastive learning, all without the need for group labels. Extensive experiments and in-depth visualizations on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely reducing reliance and significantly boosting the model generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Implicit Social Biases in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00997v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models, like CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pretraining), are becoming increasingly popular for a wide range of multimodal retrieval tasks. However, prior work has shown that large language and deep vision models can learn historical biases contained in their training sets, leading to perpetuation of stereotypes and potential downstream harm. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the social biases that are present in CLIP, with a focus on the interaction between image and text modalities. We first propose a taxonomy of social biases called So-B-IT, which contains 374 words categorized across ten types of bias. Each type can lead to societal harm if associated with a particular demographic group. Using this taxonomy, we examine images retrieved by CLIP from a facial image dataset using each word as part of a prompt. We find that CLIP frequently displays undesirable associations between harmful words and specific demographic groups, such as retrieving mostly pictures of Middle Eastern men when asked to retrieve images of a "terrorist". Finally, we conduct an analysis of the source of such biases, by showing that the same harmful stereotypes are also present in a large image-text dataset used to train CLIP models for examples of biases that we find. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating and addressing bias in vision-language models, and suggest the need for transparency and fairness-aware curation of large pre-training datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising results in high-resource domains but fall short in low-resource concepts that are under-represented (e.g. only a handful of images per category) in the pre-training set. We tackle the challenging task of zero-shot low-resource image classification from a novel perspective. By leveraging a retrieval-based strategy, we achieve this in a training-free fashion. Specifically, our method, named CoRE (Combination of Retrieval Enrichment), enriches the representation of both query images and class prototypes by retrieving relevant textual information from large web-crawled databases. This retrieval-based enrichment significantly boosts classification performance by incorporating the broader contextual information relevant to the specific class. We validate our method on a newly established benchmark covering diverse low-resource domains, including medical imaging, rare plants, and circuits. Our experiments demonstrate that CORE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that rely on synthetic data generation and model fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Main)</p></details> |

Usability issues can compromise user experience and negatively impact the perceived app quality. This paper presents UX-LLM, a novel tool powered by a Large Vision-Language Model that predicts usability issues in iOS apps. To evaluate the performance of UX-LLM we predicted usability issues in two open-source apps of a medium complexity and asked usability experts to assess the predictions. We also performed traditional usability testing and expert review for both apps and compared the results to those of UX-LLM. UX-LLM demonstrated precision ranging from 0.61 and 0.66 and recall between 0.35 and 0.38, indicating its ability to identify valid usability issues, yet failing to capture the majority of issues. Finally, we conducted a focus group with an app development team of a capstone project developing a transit app for visually impaired persons. The focus group expressed positive perceptions of UX-LLM as it identified unknown usability issues in their app. However, they also raised concerns about its integration into the development workflow, suggesting potential improvements. Our results show that UX-LLM cannot fully replace traditional usability evaluation methods but serves as a valuable supplement particularly for small teams with limited resources, to identify issues in less common user paths, due to its ability to inspect the source code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at The 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering ICSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI with Two Arms: Zero-shot Learning, Safety and Modularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03570v3)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an embodied AI system which receives open-ended natural language instructions from a human, and controls two arms to collaboratively accomplish potentially long-horizon tasks over a large workspace. Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

| **[Improving Generalization in Visual Reasoning via Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20883v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cognitive faculty of visual reasoning necessitates the integration of multimodal perceptual processing and commonsense and external knowledge of the world. In recent years, a plethora of large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been proposed, demonstrating outstanding power and exceptional proficiency in commonsense reasoning across diverse domains and tasks. Nevertheless, training such LVLMs requires a lot of costly resources. Recent approaches, instead of training LVLMs from scratch on various large datasets, focus on exploring ways to take advantage of the capabilities of many different LVLMs, such as ensemble methods. In this work, we propose self-ensemble, a novel method that improves the generalization and visual reasoning of the model without updating any parameters, a training-free method. Our key insight is that we realized that LVLM itself can ensemble without the need for any other LVLMs, which helps to unlock their internal capabilities. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on SketchyVQA, Outside Knowledge VQA, and out-of-distribution VQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

We argue that natural language is an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we investigate two key aspects: (1) how non-experts collect robotic data using natural language supervision and (2) how pre-trained vision-language models learn end-to-end policies directly from this supervision. We propose a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision (e.g., "move forward") and further augments these demonstrations. Next, we introduce a model that learns language-conditioned policies from natural language supervision called CLIP-RT. Our model employs pre-trained CLIP models and learns to predict actions represented in language via contrastive imitation learning. We first train CLIP-RT on large-scale robotic data and then enable it to learn desired skills using data collected from our framework. CLIP-RT shows strong capabilities in acquiring novel manipulation skills, outperforming the state-of-the-art model, OpenVLA (7B parameters), by 17% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B).</p></details> | 27 pages, 27 figures |

In contrast, Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically generate direct, one-shot responses without evaluating the sufficiency of the information. To investigate this gap, we identify a critical and challenging task in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) scenario: can VLMs indicate how to adjust an image when the visual information is insufficient to answer a question? This capability is especially valuable for assisting visually impaired individuals who often need guidance to capture images correctly. To evaluate this capability of current VLMs, we introduce a human-labeled dataset as a benchmark for this task. Additionally, we present an automated framework that generates synthetic training data by simulating ``where to know'' scenarios. Our empirical results show significant performance improvements in mainstream VLMs when fine-tuned with this synthetic data. This study demonstrates the potential to narrow the gap between information assessment and acquisition in VLMs, bringing their performance closer to humans.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Replace-then-Perturb: Targeted Adversarial Attacks With Visual Reasoning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00898v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional targeted adversarial attacks add a small perturbation to an image to make neural network models estimate the image as a predefined target class, even if it is not the correct target class. Recently, for visual-language models (VLMs), the focus of targeted adversarial attacks is to generate a perturbation that makes VLMs answer intended target text outputs. For example, they aim to make a small perturbation on an image to make VLMs' answers change from "there is an apple" to "there is a baseball." However, answering just intended text outputs is insufficient for tricky questions like "if there is a baseball, tell me what is below it." This is because the target of the adversarial attacks does not consider the overall integrity of the original image, thereby leading to a lack of visual reasoning. In this work, we focus on generating targeted adversarial examples with visual reasoning against VLMs. To this end, we propose 1) a novel adversarial attack procedure -- namely, Replace-then-Perturb and 2) a contrastive learning-based adversarial loss -- namely, Contrastive-Adv. In Replace-then-Perturb, we first leverage a text-guided segmentation model to find the target object in the image. Then, we get rid of the target object and inpaint the empty space with the desired prompt. By doing this, we can generate a target image corresponding to the desired prompt, while maintaining the overall integrity of the original image. Furthermore, in Contrastive-Adv, we design a novel loss function to obtain better adversarial examples. Our extensive benchmark results demonstrate that Replace-then-Perturb and Contrastive-Adv outperform the baseline adversarial attack algorithms. We note that the source code to reproduce the results will be available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figure |
| **[Unified Generative and Discriminative Training for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00304v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two predominant paradigms. Generative training has enabled Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle various complex tasks, yet issues such as hallucinations and weak object discrimination persist. Discriminative training, exemplified by models like CLIP, excels in zero-shot image-text classification and retrieval, yet struggles with complex scenarios requiring fine-grained semantic differentiation. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a unified approach that integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering interleaved image-text sequences as the general format of input samples, we introduce a structure-induced training strategy that imposes semantic relationships between input samples and the MLLM's hidden state. This approach enhances the MLLM's ability to capture global semantics and distinguish fine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic sequence alignment within the Dynamic Time Warping framework and integrating a novel kernel for fine-grained semantic differentiation, our method effectively balances generative and discriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks, especially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities. Additionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and fine-grained retrieval tasks. By employing a retrieval-augmented generation strategy, our approach further enhances performance in some generative tasks within one model, offering a promising direction for future research in vision-language modeling.</p></details> |  |

While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, it is not well established how VLM performance profiles map to human-like behaviors. If VLMs can be shown to have human-like chart comprehension abilities, they can then be applied to a broader range of tasks, such as designing and evaluating visualizations for human readers. This paper lays the foundations for such applications by evaluating the accuracy of zero-shot prompting of VLMs on graphical perception tasks with established human performance profiles. Our findings reveal that VLMs perform similarly to humans under specific task and style combinations, suggesting that they have the potential to be used for modeling human performance. Additionally, variations to the input stimuli show that VLM accuracy is sensitive to stylistic changes such as fill color and chart contiguity, even when the underlying data and data mappings are the same.</p></details> |  |
| **[ResiDual Transformer Alignment with Spectral Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00246v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When examined through the lens of their residual streams, a puzzling property emerges in transformer networks: residual contributions (e.g., attention heads) sometimes specialize in specific tasks or input attributes. In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral geometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in vision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional structure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal components and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety of input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization in multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and specialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This specialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training data, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for boosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we translate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a technique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for gold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e., attributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual perspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performances on different data distributions while modeling an extremely interpretable and parameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on more than 50 (pre-trained network, dataset) pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.</p></details> |  |

While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously. We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1). LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2). The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations. (3). Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors. We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 | Project page: https://multi-object-hallucination.github.io/</p></details> |

Analyzing demographic characteristics based on images and analyzing facial expressions have several challenges due to the complexity of humans' facial attributes. Traditional approaches have employed CNNs and various other deep learning techniques, trained on extensive collections of labeled images. While these methods demonstrated effective performance, there remains potential for further enhancements. In this paper, we propose to utilize vision language models (VLMs) such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), GEMINI, large language and vision assistant (LLAVA), PaliGemma, and Microsoft Florence2 to recognize facial attributes such as race, gender, age, and emotion from images with human faces. Various datasets like FairFace, AffectNet, and UTKFace have been utilized to evaluate the solutions. The results show that VLMs are competitive if not superior to traditional techniques. Additionally, we propose "FaceScanPaliGemma"--a fine-tuned PaliGemma model--for race, gender, age, and emotion recognition. The results show an accuracy of 81.1%, 95.8%, 80%, and 59.4% for race, gender, age group, and emotion classification, respectively, outperforming pre-trained version of PaliGemma, other VLMs, and SotA methods. Finally, we propose "FaceScanGPT", which is a GPT-4o model to recognize the above attributes when several individuals are present in the image using a prompt engineered for a person with specific facial and/or physical attributes. The results underscore the superior multitasking capability of FaceScanGPT to detect the individual's attributes like hair cut, clothing color, postures, etc., using only a prompt to drive the detection and recognition tasks.</p></details> | 52 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Bayesian-guided Label Mapping for Visual Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24018v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reprogramming (VR) leverages the intrinsic capabilities of pretrained vision models by adapting their input or output interfaces to solve downstream tasks whose labels (i.e., downstream labels) might be totally different from the labels associated with the pretrained models (i.e., pretrained labels). When adapting the output interface, label mapping methods transform the pretrained labels to downstream labels by establishing a gradient-free one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of labels. However, in this paper, we reveal that one-to-one mappings may overlook the complex relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Bayesian-guided Label Mapping (BLM) method. BLM constructs an iteratively-updated probabilistic label mapping matrix, with each element quantifying a pairwise relationship between pretrained and downstream labels. The assignment of values to the constructed matrix is guided by Bayesian conditional probability, considering the joint distribution of the downstream labels and the labels predicted by the pretrained model on downstream samples. Experiments conducted on both pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNeXt) and vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) demonstrate the superior performance of BLM over existing label mapping methods. The success of BLM also offers a probabilistic lens through which to understand and analyze the effectiveness of VR. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/BayesianLM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that rely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally expensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt learning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on task-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and suboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based framework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI). First, we introduce Large Language Model (LLM) and VLM guidance for learnable prompts, integrating detailed HOI descriptions and visual semantics to adapt VLMs to HOI tasks. However, because training datasets contain seen-class labels alone, fine-tuning VLMs on such datasets tends to optimize learnable prompts for seen classes instead of unseen ones. Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes using information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight the differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves state-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35% to 33.95% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

| **[Aggregate-and-Adapt Natural Language Prompts for Downstream Generalization of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23698v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promising generalization capability, but may struggle in specialized domains (e.g., satellite imagery) or fine-grained classification (e.g., car models) where the visual concepts are unseen or under-represented during pretraining. Prompt learning offers a parameter-efficient finetuning framework that can adapt CLIP to downstream tasks even when limited annotation data are available. In this paper, we improve prompt learning by distilling the textual knowledge from natural language prompts (either human- or LLM-generated) to provide rich priors for those under-represented concepts. We first obtain a prompt ``summary'' aligned to each input image via a learned prompt aggregator. Then we jointly train a prompt generator, optimized to produce a prompt embedding that stays close to the aggregated summary while minimizing task loss at the same time. We dub such prompt embedding as Aggregate-and-Adapted Prompt Embedding (AAPE). AAPE is shown to be able to generalize to different downstream data distributions and tasks, including vision-language understanding tasks (e.g., few-shot classification, VQA) and generation tasks (image captioning) where AAPE achieves competitive performance. We also show AAPE is particularly helpful to handle non-canonical and OOD examples. Furthermore, AAPE learning eliminates LLM-based inference cost as required by baselines, and scales better with data and LLM model size.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

With the advent of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new attack vectors, such as cognitive bias, prompt injection, and jailbreak techniques, have emerged. Understanding these attacks is crucial for developing more robust systems and demystifying the inner workings of neural networks. However, existing reviews often focus on attack classifications and lack comprehensive, in-depth analysis. The research community currently needs: 1) unified insights into adversariality, transferability, and generalization; 2) detailed evaluations of existing methods; 3) motivation-driven attack categorizations; and 4) an integrated perspective on both traditional and LVLM attacks. This article addresses these gaps by offering a thorough summary of traditional and LVLM adversarial attacks, emphasizing their connections and distinctions, and providing actionable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such abstractions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Owing to their powerful generalizability, pre-trained vision-language models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have lately gained traction as practical CL candidates. However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the downstream CL tasks often calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter. Most existing finetuning methods exhibit deterministic nature. This makes them overlook the many possible interactions across the input modalities and deems them unsafe for high-risk tasks requiring reliable uncertainty estimation. To address these, our work proposes Continual LeArning with Probabilistic finetuning (CLAP) - a probabilistic modeling framework over visual-guided text features per task, thus providing more calibrated CL finetuning. Unlike recent data-hungry anti-forgetting CL techniques, CLAP alleviates forgetting by exploiting the rich pre-trained knowledge of CLIP for weight initialization and distribution regularization of task-specific parameters. Cooperating with the diverse range of existing prompting methods, CLAP can surpass the predominant deterministic finetuning approaches for CL with CLIP. We conclude with out-of-the-box applications of superior uncertainty estimation abilities of CLAP including novel data detection and exemplar selection within the existing CL setups.

The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction.

Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in vision and language reasoning capabilities for VIL tasks. Despite the progress, current VIL methods naively employ VLMs to learn high-level plans from human videos, relying on pre-defined motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we present VLMimic, a novel paradigm that harnesses VLMs to directly learn even fine-grained action levels, only given a limited number of human videos. Specifically, VLMimic first grounds object-centric movements from human videos, and learns skills using hierarchical constraint representations, facilitating the derivation of skills with fine-grained action levels from limited human videos. These skills are refined and updated through an iterative comparison strategy, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen environments. Our extensive experiments exhibit that our VLMimic, using only 5 human videos, yields significant improvements of over 27% and 21% in RLBench and real-world manipulation tasks, and surpasses baselines by over 37% in long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Top-Down Reasoning: An Explainable Multi-Agent Approach for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17331v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, to comprehensively improve Vision Language Models (VLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA), several methods have been proposed to further reinforce the inference capabilities of VLMs to independently tackle VQA tasks rather than some methods that only utilize VLMs as aids to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, these methods ignore the rich common-sense knowledge inside the given VQA image sampled from the real world. Thus, they cannot fully use the powerful VLM for the given VQA question to achieve optimal performance. Attempt to overcome this limitation and inspired by the human top-down reasoning process, i.e., systematically exploring relevant issues to derive a comprehensive answer, this work introduces a novel, explainable multi-agent collaboration framework by leveraging the expansive knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities of VLMs themselves. Specifically, our framework comprises three agents, i.e., Responder, Seeker, and Integrator, to collaboratively answer the given VQA question by seeking its relevant issues and generating the final answer in such a top-down reasoning process. The VLM-based Responder agent generates the answer candidates for the question and responds to other relevant issues. The Seeker agent, primarily based on LLM, identifies relevant issues related to the question to inform the Responder agent and constructs a Multi-View Knowledge Base (MVKB) for the given visual scene by leveraging the build-in world knowledge of LLM. The Integrator agent combines knowledge from the Seeker agent and the Responder agent to produce the final VQA answer. Extensive and comprehensive evaluations on diverse VQA datasets with a variety of VLMs demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our framework over the baseline method in the zero-shot setting without extra training cost.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, we use this tiny \textbf{Lever-LM} to configure effective in-context demonstration (ICD) sequences to improve the In-Context Learinng (ICL) performance of LVLMs. Previous studies show that diverse ICD configurations like the selection and ordering of the demonstrations heavily affect the ICL performance, highlighting the significance of configuring effective ICD sequences. Motivated by this and by re-considering the the process of configuring ICD sequence, we find this is a mirror process of human sentence composition and further assume that effective ICD configurations may contain internal statistical patterns that can be captured by Lever-LM. Then a dataset with effective ICD sequences is constructed to train Lever-LM. After training, given novel queries, new ICD sequences are configured by the trained Lever-LM to solve vision-language tasks through ICL. Experiments show that these ICD sequences can improve the ICL performance of two LVLMs compared with some strong baselines in Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning, validating that Lever-LM can really capture the statistical patterns for levering LVLMs. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ForJadeForest/Lever-LM}.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Objectively Scoring Text-to-Image Prompt Coherence Metrics with T2IScoreScore (TS2)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04251v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness -- the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines. We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |

Vision-language models (VLMs) marked a large step for the generalization capabilities and have been already applied to various tasks. Very recently, first approaches utilized VLMs for domain generalized segmentation and object detection and obtained strong generalization. However, all these approaches rely on complex modules, feature augmentation frameworks or additional models. Surprisingly and in contrast to that, we found that simple fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models yields competitive or even stronger generalization results while being extremely simple to apply. Moreover, we found that vision-language pre-training consistently provides better generalization than the previous standard of vision-only pre-training. This challenges the standard of using ImageNet-based transfer learning for domain generalization. Fully fine-tuning a vision-language pre-trained model is capable of reaching the domain generalization SOTA when training on the synthetic GTA5 dataset. Moreover, we confirm this observation for object detection on a novel synthetic-to-real benchmark. We further obtain superior generalization capabilities by reaching 77.9% mIoU on the popular Cityscapes-to-ACDC benchmark. We also found improved in-domain generalization, leading to an improved SOTA of 86.4% mIoU on the Cityscapes test set marking the first place on the leaderboard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Calibrated Robust Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01723v6)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization during in-distribution (ID) adaptation is a primary goal of robust fine-tuning of zero-shot models beyond naive fine-tuning. However, despite decent OOD generalization performance from recent robust fine-tuning methods, confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been fully addressed. This work proposes a robust fine-tuning method that improves both OOD accuracy and confidence calibration simultaneously in vision language models. Firstly, we show that both OOD classification and OOD calibration errors have a shared upper bound consisting of two terms of ID data: 1) ID calibration error and 2) the smallest singular value of the ID input covariance matrix. Based on this insight, we design a novel framework that conducts fine-tuning with a constrained multimodal contrastive loss enforcing a larger smallest singular value, which is further guided by the self-distillation of a moving-averaged model to achieve calibrated prediction as well. Starting from empirical evidence supporting our theoretical statements, we provide extensive experimental results on ImageNet distribution shift benchmarks that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theorem and its practical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (a short version was presented at the NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Distribution Shifts)</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

Keypoint-based representations have been proven effective as a succinct representation for capturing essential object features, and for establishing a reference frame in action prediction, enabling data-efficient learning of robot skills. However, their manual design nature and reliance on additional human labels limit their scalability. In this paper, we propose KALM, a framework that leverages large pre-trained vision-language models (LMs) to automatically generate task-relevant and cross-instance consistent keypoints. KALM distills robust and consistent keypoints across views and objects by generating proposals using LMs and verifies them against a small set of robot demonstration data. Based on the generated keypoints, we can train keypoint-conditioned policy models that predict actions in keypoint-centric frames, enabling robots to generalize effectively across varying object poses, camera views, and object instances with similar functional shapes. Our method demonstrates strong performance in the real world, adapting to different tasks and environments from only a handful of demonstrations while requiring no additional labels.

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |

We outline an online algorithm for inventing such predicates and learning abstract world models.

However, due to the complexity of multimodal scenarios and the difficulty in collecting high-quality CoT data, CoT reasoning in multimodal LLMs has been largely overlooked. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework, R3V, which iteratively enhances the model's Vision-language Reasoning by Reflecting on CoT Rationales. Our framework consists of two interleaved parts: (1) iteratively bootstrapping positive and negative solutions for reasoning datasets, and (2) reflection on rationale for learning from mistakes. Specifically, we introduce the self-refine and self-select losses, enabling the model to refine flawed rationale and derive the correct answer by comparing rationale candidates. Experiments on a wide range of vision-language tasks show that R3V consistently improves multimodal LLM reasoning, achieving a relative improvement of 23 to 60 percent over GPT-distilled baselines. Additionally, our approach supports self-reflection on generated solutions, further boosting performance through test-time computation.</p></details> |  |

Most existing approaches train and track within a single domain, resulting in a lack of cross-domain generalizability to data from other domains. While several works have introduced natural language representation to bridge the domain gap in visual tracking, these textual descriptions often provide too high-level a view and fail to distinguish various instances within the same class. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing IP-MOT, an end-to-end transformer model for MOT that operates without concrete textual descriptions. Our approach is underpinned by two key innovations: Firstly, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model, we obtain instance-level pseudo textual descriptions via prompt-tuning, which are invariant across different tracking scenes; Secondly, we introduce a query-balanced strategy, augmented by knowledge distillation, to further boost the generalization capabilities of our model. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MOT benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack, demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance on same-domain data compared to state-of-the-art models but also significantly improves the performance of query-based trackers by large margins for cross-domain inputs.</p></details> |  |

Classic computer vision techniques offer a promising direction for Animal Re-identification (Animal ReID), but their backbones' close-set nature limits their applicability and generalizability. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of vision-language models like CLIP in re-identifying persons and vehicles, their application to Animal ReID remains limited due to unique challenges, such as the various visual representations of animals, including variations in poses and forms. To address these limitations, we leverage CLIP's cross-modal capabilities to introduce a two-stage framework, the \textbf{Indiv}idual \textbf{A}nimal \textbf{ID}entity-Driven (IndivAID) framework, specifically designed for Animal ReID. In the first stage, IndivAID trains a text description generator by extracting individual semantic information from each image, generating both image-specific and individual-specific textual descriptions that fully capture the diverse visual concepts of each individual across animal images. In the second stage, IndivAID refines its learning of visual concepts by dynamically incorporating individual-specific textual descriptions with an integrated attention module to further highlight discriminative features of individuals for Animal ReID. Evaluation against state-of-the-art methods across eight benchmark datasets and a real-world Stoat dataset demonstrates IndivAID's effectiveness and applicability.

Until now, state recognition methods have been based on training neural networks from manual annotations, preparing special sensors for the recognition, or manually programming to extract features from point clouds or raw images. In contrast, we propose a robotic state recognition method using a pre-trained vision-language model, which is capable of Image-to-Text Retrieval (ITR) tasks. We prepare several kinds of language prompts in advance, calculate the similarity between these prompts and the current image by ITR, and perform state recognition. By applying the optimal weighting to each prompt using black-box optimization, state recognition can be performed with higher accuracy. Experiments show that this theory enables a variety of state recognitions by simply preparing multiple prompts without retraining neural networks or manual programming. In addition, since only prompts and their weights need to be prepared for each recognizer, there is no need to prepare multiple models, which facilitates resource management. It is possible to recognize the open/closed state of transparent doors, the state of whether water is running or not from a faucet, and even the qualitative state of whether a kitchen is clean or not, which have been challenging so far, through language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Humanoids2024</p></details> |

Numerous VQA datasets have been introduced to facilitate various tasks, such as answering questions or identifying unanswerable ones. However, most of these datasets are constructed using real-world images, leaving the performance of existing models on cartoon images largely unexplored. Hence, in this paper, we present "SimpsonsVQA", a novel dataset for VQA derived from The Simpsons TV show, designed to promote inquiry-based learning. Our dataset is specifically designed to address not only the traditional VQA task but also to identify irrelevant questions related to images, as well as the reverse scenario where a user provides an answer to a question that the system must evaluate (e.g., as correct, incorrect, or ambiguous). It aims to cater to various visual applications, harnessing the visual content of "The Simpsons" to create engaging and informative interactive systems. SimpsonsVQA contains approximately 23K images, 166K QA pairs, and 500K judgments (https://simpsonsvqa.org). Our experiments show that current large vision-language models like ChatGPT4o underperform in zero-shot settings across all three tasks, highlighting the dataset's value for improving model performance on cartoon images. We anticipate that SimpsonsVQA will inspire further research, innovation, and advancements in inquiry-based learning VQA.</p></details> |  |

Through experimental analysis, we have observed a phenomenon wherein adversarial perturbations induce shifts in text-guided attention. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective strategy: Text-Guided Attention for Zero-Shot Robustness (TGA-ZSR). This framework incorporates two components: the Attention Refinement module and the Attention-based Model Constraint module. Our goal is to maintain the generalization of the CLIP model and enhance its adversarial robustness: The Attention Refinement module aligns the text-guided attention obtained from the target model via adversarial examples with the text-guided attention acquired from the original model via clean examples. This alignment enhances the model's robustness. Additionally, the Attention-based Model Constraint module acquires text-guided attention from both the target and original models using clean examples. Its objective is to maintain model performance on clean samples while enhancing overall robustness. The experiments validate that our method yields a 9.58% enhancement in zero-shot robust accuracy over the current state-of-the-art techniques across 16 datasets.

However, despite their remarkable capabilities, the safety and security of these agents against malicious attacks remain critically underexplored, raising significant concerns about their safe deployment. To uncover and exploit such vulnerabilities in web agents, we provide AdvWeb, a novel black-box attack framework designed against web agents. AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that generates and injects adversarial prompts into web pages, misleading web agents into executing targeted adversarial actions such as inappropriate stock purchases or incorrect bank transactions, actions that could lead to severe real-world consequences. With only black-box access to the web agent, we train and optimize the adversarial prompter model using DPO, leveraging both successful and failed attack strings against the target agent. Unlike prior approaches, our adversarial string injection maintains stealth and control: (1) the appearance of the website remains unchanged before and after the attack, making it nearly impossible for users to detect tampering, and (2) attackers can modify specific substrings within the generated adversarial string to seamlessly change the attack objective (e.g., purchasing stocks from a different company), enhancing attack flexibility and efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations, demonstrating that AdvWeb achieves high success rates in attacking SOTA GPT-4V-based VLM agent across various web tasks. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current LLM/VLM-based agents, emphasizing the urgent need for developing more reliable web agents and effective defenses. Our code and data are available at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvWeb/ .</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[OpenDAS: Open-Vocabulary Domain Adaptation for 2D and 3D Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20141v4)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.

A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%.</p></details> |  |

In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format. Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones. These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase. In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue. Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs. The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment. To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison. Our experiments across three different clinical departments remarkably demonstrate the efficacy of ZALM3 with statistical significance.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark 1) captures real-world use cases, 2) is fully automatic and does not require human judgment, and 3) is based on a renewable stream of fresh data. In Image2Struct, VLMs are prompted to generate the underlying structure (e.g., LaTeX code or HTML) from an input image (e.g., webpage screenshot). The structure is then rendered to produce an output image (e.g., rendered webpage), which is compared against the input image to produce a similarity score. This round-trip evaluation allows us to quantitatively evaluate VLMs on tasks with multiple valid structures. We create a pipeline that downloads fresh data from active online communities upon execution and evaluates the VLMs without human intervention. We introduce three domains (Webpages, LaTeX, and Musical Scores) and use five image metrics (pixel similarity, cosine similarity between the Inception vectors, learned perceptual image patch similarity, structural similarity index measure, and earth mover similarity) that allow efficient and automatic comparison between pairs of images. We evaluate Image2Struct on 14 prominent VLMs and find that scores vary widely, indicating that Image2Struct can differentiate between the performances of different VLMs. Additionally, the best score varies considerably across domains (e.g., 0.402 on sheet music vs. 0.830 on LaTeX equations), indicating that Image2Struct contains tasks of varying difficulty. For transparency, we release the full results at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/image2struct/v1.0.1/.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

They learn the prompt given few samples from the downstream task given the specific class names as prior knowledge, which we term as semantic-aware classification. However, in many realistic scenarios, we only have access to few samples and knowledge of the class names (e.g., when considering instances of classes). This challenging scenario represents the semantic-agnostic discriminative case. Text-to-Image (T2I) personalization methods aim to adapt T2I models to unseen concepts by learning new tokens and endowing these tokens with the capability of generating the learned concepts. These methods do not require knowledge of class names as a semantic-aware prior. Therefore, in this paper, we first explore Textual Inversion and reveal that the new concept tokens possess both generation and classification capabilities by regarding each category as a single concept. However, learning classifiers from single-concept textual inversion is limited since the learned tokens are suboptimal for the discriminative tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose Multi-Class textual inversion, which includes a discriminative regularization term for the token updating process. Using this technique, our method MC-TI achieves stronger Semantic-Agnostic Classification while preserving the generation capability of these modifier tokens given only few samples per category. In the experiments, we extensively evaluate MC-TI on 12 datasets covering various scenarios, which demonstrates that MC-TI achieves superior results in terms of both classification and generation outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2025.

Recent methods aim to address these limitations by relying on the semantics of the textual description, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to break them down into subsets of questions and answers. However, these methods primarily operate on the surface level, failing to incorporate deeper lexical understanding while introducing incorrect assumptions generated by the LLM. In response to these issues, we present Caption Expansion with Contradictions and Entailments (CECE), a principled approach that leverages Natural Language Inference (NLI) to generate entailments and contradictions from a given premise. CECE produces lexically diverse sentences while maintaining their core meaning. Through extensive experiments, we show that CECE enhances interpretability and reduces overreliance on biased or superficial features. By balancing CECE along the original premise, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods without requiring additional fine-tuning, producing state-of-the-art results on benchmarks that score agreement with human judgments for image-text alignment, and achieving an increase in performance on Winoground of +19.2% (group score) and +12.9% on EqBen (group score) over the best prior work (finetuned with targeted data).</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cece-vlm.github.io/</p></details> |

In contrast, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in scene understanding and reasoning. The path forward lies in merging the strengths of both approaches. Previous methods using LVLMs to predict trajectories or control signals yield suboptimal results, as LVLMs are not well-suited for precise numerical predictions. This paper presents Senna, an autonomous driving system combining an LVLM (Senna-VLM) with an end-to-end model (Senna-E2E). Senna decouples high-level planning from low-level trajectory prediction. Senna-VLM generates planning decisions in natural language, while Senna-E2E predicts precise trajectories. Senna-VLM utilizes a multi-image encoding approach and multi-view prompts for efficient scene understanding. Besides, we introduce planning-oriented QAs alongside a three-stage training strategy, which enhances Senna-VLM's planning performance while preserving commonsense. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that Senna achieves state-of-the-art planning performance. Notably, with pre-training on a large-scale dataset DriveX and fine-tuning on nuScenes, Senna significantly reduces average planning error by 27.12% and collision rate by 33.33% over model without pre-training. We believe Senna's cross-scenario generalization and transferability are essential for achieving fully autonomous driving.

Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | 39 pages, 10 figures |

The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, there still exists a considerable performance gap between these models and a supervised deep model trained on a downstream dataset. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel active learning (AL) framework that enhances the zero-shot classification performance of VLMs by selecting only a few informative samples from the unlabeled data for annotation during training. To achieve this, our approach first calibrates the predicted entropy of VLMs and then utilizes a combination of self-uncertainty and neighbor-aware uncertainty to calculate a reliable uncertainty measure for active sample selection. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing AL approaches on several image classification datasets, and significantly enhances the zero-shot performance of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, these models fail to perform well on low-level basic visual tasks which are especially easy for humans. Our goal in this work was to determine if these models are truly "blind" to geometric reasoning or if there are ways to enhance their capabilities in this area. Our work presents a novel automatic pipeline designed to extract key information from images in response to specific questions. Instead of just relying on direct VQA, we use question-derived keywords to create a caption that highlights important details in the image related to the question. This caption is then used by a language model to provide a precise answer to the question without requiring external fine-tuning.</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure |

However, the evaluation of LVLMs presents significant challenges as the evaluation benchmark always demands lots of human cost for its construction, and remains static, lacking flexibility once constructed. Even though automatic evaluation has been explored in textual modality, the visual modality remains under-explored. As a result, in this work, we address a question: "Can LVLMs serve as a path to automatic benchmarking?". We introduce AutoBench-V, an automated framework for serving evaluation on demand, i.e., benchmarking LVLMs based on specific aspects of model capability. Upon receiving an evaluation capability, AutoBench-V leverages text-to-image models to generate relevant image samples and then utilizes LVLMs to orchestrate visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, completing the evaluation process efficiently and flexibly. Through an extensive evaluation of seven popular LVLMs across five demanded user inputs (i.e., evaluation capabilities), the framework shows effectiveness and reliability. We observe the following: (1) Our constructed benchmark accurately reflects varying task difficulties; (2) As task difficulty rises, the performance gap between models widens; (3) While models exhibit strong performance in abstract level understanding, they underperform in details reasoning tasks; and (4) Constructing a dataset with varying levels of difficulties is critical for a comprehensive and exhaustive evaluation. Overall, AutoBench-V not only successfully utilizes LVLMs for automated benchmarking but also reveals that LVLMs as judges have significant potential in various domains.</p></details> |  |

While current open-source LVLMs demonstrate promising performance in simplified scenarios such as single-turn single-image input, they fall short in real-world conversation scenarios such as following instructions in a long context history with multi-turn and multi-images. Existing LVLM benchmarks primarily focus on single-choice questions or short-form responses, which do not adequately assess the capabilities of LVLMs in real-world human-AI interaction applications. Therefore, we introduce MMDU, a comprehensive benchmark, and MMDU-45k, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset, designed to evaluate and improve LVLMs' abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations. We employ the clustering algorithm to ffnd the relevant images and textual descriptions from the open-source Wikipedia and construct the question-answer pairs by human annotators with the assistance of the GPT-4o model. MMDU has a maximum of 18k image+text tokens, 20 images, and 27 turns, which is at least 5x longer than previous benchmarks and poses challenges to current LVLMs. Our in-depth analysis of 15 representative LVLMs using MMDU reveals that open-source LVLMs lag behind closed-source counterparts due to limited conversational instruction tuning data. We demonstrate that ffne-tuning open-source LVLMs on MMDU-45k signiffcantly address this gap, generating longer and more accurate conversations, and improving scores on MMDU and existing benchmarks (MMStar: +1.1%, MathVista: +1.5%, ChartQA:+1.2%).

We here take inspiration from human cognitive development to train models in limited data conditions. Specifically we present a self-synthesis approach that iterates through four phases: Phase 1 sets up fundamental language abilities, training the model from scratch on a small corpus. Language is then associated with the visual environment in phase 2, integrating the model with a vision encoder to generate descriptive captions from labeled images. In the "self-synthesis" phase 3, the model generates captions for unlabeled images, that it then uses to further train its language component with a mix of synthetic, and previous real-world text. This phase is meant to expand the model's linguistic repertoire, similar to humans self-annotating new experiences. Finally, phase 4 develops advanced cognitive skills, by training the model on specific tasks such as visual question answering and reasoning. Our approach offers a proof of concept for training a multimodal model using a developmentally plausible amount of data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BabyLM Challenge at CoNLL 2024</p></details> |

Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content.

We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models.

Recently, significant research efforts have focused on evaluating the robustness of VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Due to challenges in obtaining multi-modal data, current studies often assess VLM robustness by generating adversarial or query-relevant images based on harmful text datasets. However, the jailbreak images generated this way exhibit certain limitations. Adversarial images require white-box access to the target VLM and are relatively easy to defend against, while query-relevant images must be linked to the target harmful content, limiting their diversity and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel jailbreak method named IDEATOR, which autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is a VLM-based approach inspired by our conjecture that a VLM itself might be a powerful red team model for generating jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR employs a VLM to generate jailbreak texts while leveraging a state-of-the-art diffusion model to create corresponding jailbreak images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high effectiveness and transferability of IDEATOR. It successfully jailbreaks MiniGPT-4 with a 94% success rate and transfers seamlessly to LLaVA and InstructBLIP, achieving high success rates of 82% and 88%, respectively. IDEATOR uncovers previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in VLMs, calling for advanced safety mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

As the saying goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words", so developing an effective sticker retrieval technique is crucial for enhancing user experience. However, existing sticker retrieval methods rely on labeled data to interpret stickers, and general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to capture the unique semantics of stickers. Additionally, relevant-based sticker retrieval methods lack personalization, creating a gap between diverse user expectations and retrieval results. To address these, we propose the Personalized Sticker Retrieval with Vision-Language Model framework, namely PerSRV, structured into offline calculations and online processing modules. The online retrieval part follows the paradigm of relevant recall and personalized ranking, supported by the offline pre-calculation parts, which are sticker semantic understanding, utility evaluation and personalization modules. Firstly, for sticker-level semantic understanding, we supervised fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5-7B to generate human-like sticker semantics, complemented by textual content extracted from figures and historical interaction queries. Secondly, we investigate three crowd-sourcing metrics for sticker utility evaluation. Thirdly, we cluster style centroids based on users' historical interactions to achieve personal preference modeling. Finally, we evaluate our proposed PerSRV method on a public sticker retrieval dataset from WeChat, containing 543,098 candidates and 12,568 interactions. Experimental results show that PerSRV significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-modal sticker retrieval. Additionally, our fine-tuned VLM delivers notable improvements in sticker semantic understandings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Encoder-Free Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11832v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across modalities.

| **[Advances in Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis for Biomedical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02843v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) represents an innovative biomedical imaging modality that harnesses the advantages of optical resolution and acoustic penetration depth while ensuring enhanced safety. Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG): point cloud-based iterative algorithm for large-scale 3D photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11781v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale 3D photoacoustic (PA) imaging has become increasingly important for both clinical and pre-clinical applications. Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arc-to-line frame registration method for ultrasound and photoacoustic image-guided intraoperative robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12590v1)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To achieve effective robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, the integration of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging system which is the most widely used imaging modelity in prostate imaging is essential. However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Fourier Neural Operator Networks: A Fast and General Solver for the Photoacoustic Wave Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09374v1)** | 2021-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation tools for photoacoustic wave propagation have played a key role in advancing photoacoustic imaging by providing quantitative and qualitative insights into parameters affecting image quality. Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem.

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Y-Net: A Hybrid Deep Learning Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Imaging in vivo](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00975v1)** | 2019-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging non-invasive imaging modality combining the advantages of deep ultrasound penetration and high optical contrast. Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedDTPT: Federated Discrete and Transferable Prompt Tuning for Black-Box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00985v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP). By fine-tuning LLMs with data from specific scenarios, these foundation models can better adapt to various downstream tasks. However, the fine-tuning process poses privacy leakage risks, particularly in centralized data processing scenarios. To address user privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to mitigate the risks associated with centralized data collection from multiple sources. Nevertheless, the privacy of LLMs themselves is equally critical, as potential malicious attacks challenge their security, an issue that has received limited attention in current research. Consequently, establishing a trusted multi-party model fine-tuning environment is essential. Additionally, the local deployment of large LLMs incurs significant storage costs and high computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose for the first time a federated discrete and transferable prompt tuning, namely FedDTPT, for black-box large language models. In the client optimization phase, we adopt a token-level discrete prompt optimization method that leverages a feedback loop based on prediction accuracy to drive gradient-free prompt optimization through the MLM API. For server optimization, we employ an attention mechanism based on semantic similarity to filter all local prompt tokens, along with an embedding distance elbow detection and DBSCAN clustering strategy to enhance the filtering process. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher accuracy, reduced communication overhead, and robustness to non-iid data in a black-box setting. Moreover, the optimized prompts are transferable.</p></details> |  |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the Next AutoDiff: Generative Optimization with Rich Feedback, Execution Traces, and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization -- using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

| **[Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06255v4)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 1 figure, 35 tables</p></details> |

While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named {\name}, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. {\name} introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles.

However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability to news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first self-tuning prompting framework for news recommendation, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex news recommendation tasks. This framework incorporates a news recommender and a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process to enhance recommendations through automatic prompt engineering. Extensive experimental results with 400 users show that RecPrompt can achieve an improvement of 3.36% in AUC, 10.49% in MRR, 9.64% in nDCG@5, and 6.20% in nDCG@10 compared to deep neural models. Additionally, we introduce TopicScore, a novel metric to assess explainability by evaluating LLM's ability to summarize topics of interest for users. The results show LLM's effectiveness in accurately identifying topics of interest and delivering comprehensive topic-based explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://imprompter.ai code: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter v2 changelog: add new results to Table 3, correct several typos</p></details> |
| **[IPO: Interpretable Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15397v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts.

| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v4)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results.

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs.

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures.

In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights.

We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages.

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements.

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |

Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

| **[Large Language Models Prompting With Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07465v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization is essential for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in scenarios of few-shot learning where training examples are incorporated directly into the prompt. Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space.

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios.

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[LangGPT: Rethinking Structured Reusable Prompt Design Framework for LLMs from the Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16929v2)** | 2024-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prompt Optimizer of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Abstract Concept Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11589v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality. However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models as Prompt Optimizers: An Analogical Analysis with Gradient-based Model Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17564v2)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic prompt optimization is an important approach to improving the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

| **[$\textit{LinkPrompt}$: Natural and Universal Adversarial Attacks on Prompt-based Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16432v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

| **[Dynamic Prompt Optimizing for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04095v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generative models, specifically those based on diffusion models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion, have made substantial advancements. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

| **[Automatic Prompt Selection for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02717v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform various natural language processing tasks with suitable instruction prompts. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alpaca against Vicuna: Using LLMs to Uncover Memorization of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04801v2)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a black-box prompt optimization method that uses an attacker LLM agent to uncover higher levels of memorization in a victim agent, compared to what is revealed by prompting the target model with the training data directly, which is the dominant approach of quantifying memorization in LLMs. We use an iterative rejection-sampling optimization process to find instruction-based prompts with two main characteristics: (1) minimal overlap with the training data to avoid presenting the solution directly to the model, and (2) maximal overlap between the victim model's output and the training data, aiming to induce the victim to spit out training data. We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.
