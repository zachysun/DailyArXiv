| **[Analyzing Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting via Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13792v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have consistently achieved remarkable results in various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, despite ongoing research efforts to better understand these models, the field still lacks a comprehensive understanding. This is particularly true for deep time series forecasting methods, where analysis and understanding work is relatively limited. Time series data, unlike image and text information, can be more challenging to interpret and analyze. To address this, we approach the problem from a manifold learning perspective, assuming that the latent representations of time series forecasting models lie next to a low-dimensional manifold. In our study, we focus on analyzing the geometric features of these latent data manifolds, including intrinsic dimension and principal curvatures. Our findings reveal that deep transformer models exhibit similar geometric behavior across layers, and these geometric features are correlated with model performance. Additionally, we observe that untrained models initially have different structures, but they rapidly converge during training. By leveraging our geometric analysis and differentiable tools, we can potentially design new and improved deep forecasting neural networks. This approach complements existing analysis studies and contributes to a better understanding of transformer models in the context of time series forecasting.

| **[Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13763v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Subsequence Approach to Topological Data Analysis for Irregularly-Spaced Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13723v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A time-delay embedding (TDE), grounded in the framework of Takens's Theorem, provides a mechanism to represent and analyze the inherent dynamics of time-series data. Recently, topological data analysis (TDA) methods have been applied to study this time series representation mainly through the lens of persistent homology. Current literature on the fusion of TDE and TDA are adept at analyzing uniformly-spaced time series observations. This work introduces a novel {\em subsequence} embedding method for irregularly-spaced time-series data. We show that this method preserves the original state space topology while reducing spurious homological features. Theoretical stability results and convergence properties of the proposed method in the presence of noise and varying levels of irregularity in the spacing of the time series are established. Numerical studies and an application to real data illustrates the performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[RECOVAR: Representation Covariances on Deep Latent Spaces for Seismic Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18402v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern deep learning methods have shown great promise in the problem of earthquake detection, the most successful methods so far have been based on supervised learning, which requires large datasets with ground-truth labels. The curation of such datasets is both time consuming and prone to systematic biases, which result in difficulties with cross-dataset generalization, hindering general applicability. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised method for earthquake detection that learns to detect earthquakes from raw waveforms, without access to ground truth labels. The performance is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, the method has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization} performance. The algorithm utilizes deep autoencoders that learn to reproduce the waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck and uses a simple, cross-covariance-based triggering algorithm at the bottleneck for labeling. The approach has the potential to be useful for time series datasets from other domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive deep learning framework for forecasting the decadal world economic outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10874v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used indicator in macroeconomics and the main tool for measuring a country's economic output. Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical testing on generative AI anomaly detection tools in Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13363v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's Disease is challenging to diagnose due to our limited understanding of its mechanism and large heterogeneity among patients. Neurodegeneration is studied widely as a biomarker for clinical diagnosis, which can be measured from time series MRI progression. On the other hand, generative AI has shown promise in anomaly detection in medical imaging and used for tasks including tumor detection. However, testing the reliability of such data-driven methods is non-trivial due to the issue of double-dipping in hypothesis testing. In this work, we propose to solve this issue with selective inference and develop a reliable generative AI method for Alzheimer's prediction. We show that compared to traditional statistical methods with highly inflated p-values, selective inference successfully controls the false discovery rate under the desired alpha level while retaining statistical power. In practice, our pipeline could assist clinicians in Alzheimer's diagnosis and early intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffImp: Efficient Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Time Series Imputation with Bidirectional Mamba Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13338v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic time series imputation has been widely applied in real-world scenarios due to its ability to estimate uncertainty of imputation results. Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and higlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. We hope our work can bring a new perspective for time series forecasting. We intend to make our code publicly available as open-source in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Matters: Leveraging Contextual Features for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12672v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasts are often influenced by exogenous contextual features in addition to their corresponding history. For example, in financial settings, it is hard to accurately predict a stock price without considering public sentiments and policy decisions in the form of news articles, tweets, etc. Though this is common knowledge, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasting models fail to incorporate such contextual information, owing to its heterogeneity and multimodal nature. To address this, we introduce ContextFormer, a novel plug-and-play method to surgically integrate multimodal contextual information into existing pre-trained forecasting models. ContextFormer effectively distills forecast-specific information from rich multimodal contexts, including categorical, continuous, time-varying, and even textual information, to significantly enhance the performance of existing base forecasters. ContextFormer outperforms SOTA forecasting models by up to 30% on a range of real-world datasets spanning energy, traffic, environmental, and financial domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Progress in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Comprehensive Benchmarking and Heterogeneity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06119v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis is crucial to understanding and managing complex systems, such as traffic and energy systems, and a variety of approaches to MTS forecasting have been proposed recently. However, we often observe inconsistent or seemingly contradictory performance findings across different studies. This hinders our understanding of the merits of different approaches and slows down progress. We address the need for means of assessing MTS forecasting proposals reliably and fairly, in turn enabling better exploitation of MTS as seen in different applications. Specifically, we first propose BasicTS+, a benchmark designed to enable fair, comprehensive, and reproducible comparison of MTS forecasting solutions. BasicTS+ establishes a unified training pipeline and reasonable settings, enabling an unbiased evaluation. Second, we identify the heterogeneity across different MTS as an important consideration and enable classification of MTS based on their temporal and spatial characteristics. Disregarding this heterogeneity is a prime reason for difficulties in selecting the most promising technical directions. Third, we apply BasicTS+ along with rich datasets to assess the capabilities of more than 45 MTS forecasting solutions. This provides readers with an overall picture of the cutting-edge research on MTS forecasting.

| **[Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12915v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSET: Swapping-Sliding Explanation for Time Series Classifiers in Affect Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12996v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local explanation of machine learning (ML) models has recently received significant attention due to its ability to reduce ambiguities about why the models make specific decisions. Extensive efforts have been invested to address explainability for different data types, particularly images. However, the work on multivariate time series data is limited. A possible reason is that the conflation of time and other variables in time series data can cause the generated explanations to be incomprehensible to humans. In addition, some efforts on time series fall short of providing accurate explanations as they either ignore a context in the time domain or impose differentiability requirements on the ML models. Such restrictions impede their ability to provide valid explanations in real-world applications and non-differentiable ML settings. In this paper, we propose a swapping--sliding decision explanation for multivariate time series classifiers, called SSET. The proposal consists of swapping and sliding stages, by which salient sub-sequences causing significant drops in the prediction score are presented as explanations. In the former stage, the important variables are detected by swapping the series of interest with close train data from target classes. In the latter stage, the salient observations of these variables are explored by sliding a window over each time step. Additionally, the model measures the importance of different variables over time in a novel way characterized by multiple factors. We leverage SSET on affect detection domain where evaluations are performed on two real-world physiological time series datasets, WESAD and MAHNOB-HCI, and a deep convolutional classifier, CN-Waterfall. This classifier has shown superior performance to prior models to detect human affective states. Comparing SSET with several benchmarks, including LIME, integrated gradients, and Dynamask, we found..</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Posterior Sampling: Time Series Generation with Hard Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12652v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic time series samples is crucial for stress-testing models and protecting user privacy by using synthetic data. In engineering and safety-critical applications, these samples must meet certain hard constraints that are domain-specific or naturally imposed by physics or nature. Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints (~100) without requiring additional training. We provide theoretical justifications highlighting the impact of our projection step on sampling. Empirically, CPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sample quality and similarity to real time series by around 10% and 42%, respectively, on real-world stocks, traffic, and air quality datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Computation with DVFS using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Task Systems in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19434v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Periodic soft real-time systems have broad applications in many areas, such as IoT. Finding an optimal energy-efficient policy that is adaptable to underlying edge devices while meeting deadlines for tasks has always been challenging. This research studies generalized systems with multi-task, multi-deadline scenarios with reinforcement learning-based DVFS for energy saving. This work addresses the limitation of previous work that models a periodic system as a single task and single-deadline scenario, which is too simplified to cope with complex situations. The method encodes time series information in the Linux kernel into information that is easy to use for reinforcement learning, allowing the system to generate DVFS policies to adapt system patterns based on the general workload. For encoding, we present two different methods for comparison. Both methods use only one performance counter: system utilization and the kernel only needs minimal information from the userspace. Our method is implemented on Jetson Nano Board (2GB) and is tested with three fixed multitask workloads, which are three, five, and eight tasks in the workload, respectively. For randomness and generalization, we also designed a random workload generator to build different multitask workloads to test. Based on the test results, our method could save 3%-10% power compared to Linux built-in governors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Disentangled Representations for Multivariate Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12606v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series data in fields like healthcare and industry are informative but challenging due to high dimensionality and lack of labels. Recent self-supervised learning methods excel in learning rich representations without labels but struggle with disentangled embeddings and inductive bias issues like transformation-invariance. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop: Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice</p></details> |

Existing approaches used by practitioners are often ad-hoc and lack the abstractions needed to scale this process. We present TorchQL, a programming framework to evaluate and improve the correctness of machine learning applications. TorchQL allows users to write queries to specify and check integrity constraints over machine learning models and datasets. It seamlessly integrates relational algebra with functional programming to allow for highly expressive queries using only eight intuitive operators. We evaluate TorchQL on diverse use-cases including finding critical temporal inconsistencies in objects detected across video frames in autonomous driving, finding data imputation errors in time-series medical records, finding data labeling errors in real-world images, and evaluating biases and constraining outputs of language models. Our experiments show that TorchQL enables up to 13x faster query executions than baselines like Pandas and MongoDB, and up to 40% shorter queries than native Python. We also conduct a user study and find that TorchQL is natural enough for developers familiar with Python to specify complex integrity constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parsimony or Capability? Decomposition Delivers Both in Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11929v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both analytical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99 \% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics--a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisited Large Language Model for Time Series Analysis through Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12326v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive performance in many pivotal web applications such as sensor data analysis. However, since LLMs are not designed for time series tasks, simpler models like linear regressions can often achieve comparable performance with far less complexity. In this study, we perform extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of applying LLMs to key time series tasks, including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection. We compare the performance of LLMs against simpler baseline models, such as single-layer linear models and randomly initialized LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs offer minimal advantages for these core time series tasks and may even distort the temporal structure of the data. In contrast, simpler models consistently outperform LLMs while requiring far fewer parameters. Furthermore, we analyze existing reprogramming techniques and show, through data manifold analysis, that these methods fail to effectively align time series data with language and display pseudo-alignment behaviour in embedding space. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLM-based methods in time series tasks arises from the intrinsic characteristics and structure of time series data, rather than any meaningful alignment with the language model architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Leitmotifs in Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12293v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A leitmotif is a recurring theme in literature, movies or music that carries symbolic significance for the piece it is contained in. When this piece can be represented as a multi-dimensional time series (MDTS), such as acoustic or visual observations, finding a leitmotif is equivalent to the pattern discovery problem, which is an unsupervised and complex problem in time series analytics. Compared to the univariate case, it carries additional complexity because patterns typically do not occur in all dimensions but only in a few - which are, however, unknown and must be detected by the method itself. In this paper, we present the novel, efficient and highly effective leitmotif discovery algorithm LAMA for MDTS. LAMA rests on two core principals: (a) a leitmotif manifests solely given a yet unknown number of sub-dimensions - neither too few, nor too many, and (b) the set of sub-dimensions are not independent from the best pattern found therein, necessitating both problems to be approached in a joint manner. In contrast to most previous methods, LAMA tackles both problems jointly - instead of independently selecting dimensions (or leitmotifs) and finding the best leitmotifs (or dimensions). Our experimental evaluation on a novel ground-truth annotated benchmark of 14 distinct real-life data sets shows that LAMA, when compared to four state-of-the-art baselines, shows superior performance in detecting meaningful patterns without increased computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATCH: Channel-Aware multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12261v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning nomral patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising resutls, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Irregularity-Informed Time Series Analysis: Adaptive Modelling of Spatial and Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12257v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular Time Series Data (IRTS) has shown increasing prevalence in real-world applications. We observed that IRTS can be divided into two specialized types: Natural Irregular Time Series (NIRTS) and Accidental Irregular Time Series (AIRTS). Various existing methods either ignore the impacts of irregular patterns or statically learn the irregular dynamics of NIRTS and AIRTS data and suffer from limited data availability due to the sparsity of IRTS. We proposed a novel transformer-based framework for general irregular time series data that treats IRTS from four views: Locality, Time, Spatio and Irregularity to motivate the data usage to the highest potential. Moreover, we design a sophisticated irregularity-gate mechanism to adaptively select task-relevant information from irregularity, which improves the generalization ability to various IRTS data. We implement extensive experiments to demonstrate the resistance of our work to three highly missing ratio datasets (88.4\%, 94.9\%, 60\% missing value) and investigate the significance of the irregularity information for both NIRTS and AIRTS by additional ablation study. We release our implementation in https://github.com/IcurasLW/MTSFormer-Irregular_Time_Series.git</p></details> |  |
| **[FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abnormality Forecasting: Time Series Anomaly Prediction via Future Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12206v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying anomalies from time series data plays an important role in various fields such as infrastructure security, intelligent operation and maintenance, and space exploration. Current research focuses on detecting the anomalies after they occur, which can lead to significant financial/reputation loss or infrastructure damage. In this work we instead study a more practical yet very challenging problem, time series anomaly prediction, aiming at providing early warnings for abnormal events before their occurrence. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel principled approach, namely future context modeling (FCM). Its key insight is that the future abnormal events in a target window can be accurately predicted if their preceding observation window exhibits any subtle difference to normal data. To effectively capture such differences, FCM first leverages long-term forecasting models to generate a discriminative future context based on the observation data, aiming to amplify those subtle but unusual difference. It then models a normality correlation of the observation data with the forecasting future context to complement the normality modeling of the observation data in foreseeing possible abnormality in the target window. A joint variate-time attention learning is also introduced in FCM to leverage both temporal signals and features of the time series data for more discriminative normality modeling in the aforementioned two views. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that FCM gains good recall rate (70\%+) on multiple datasets and significantly outperforms all baselines in F1 score. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/FCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to KDD conference</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Fourier Transform for Image Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05953v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum information processing and its subfield, quantum image processing, are rapidly growing fields as a result of advancements in the practicality of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for processing information, such as one-dimensional time series and two-dimensional images, in the frequency domain. The information of interest is encoded into the magnitude of probability amplitude or the coefficient of each basis state. The oracle for filtering operates based on postselection results, and its explicit circuit design is presented. This oracle is versatile enough to perform all basic filtering, including high pass, low pass, band pass, band stop, and many other processing techniques. Finally, we present two novel schemes for transposing matrices in this paper. They use similar encoding rules but with deliberate choices in terms of selecting basis states. These schemes could potentially be useful for other quantum information processing tasks, such as edge detection. The proposed techniques are implemented on the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator. Some results are compared with traditional information processing results to verify their correctness and are presented in this paper.</p></details> | 12 pages, 53 figures |

Traditional time series approaches for prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies solely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward modeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous variables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past exogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that effectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for improved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information efficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and introduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables the model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series, treating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately, ExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that arise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current exogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets and time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\% in prediction accuracy. Moreover, ExoTST exhibits strong robustness against missing values and noise in exogenous drivers, maintaining consistent performance in real-world situations where these imperfections are common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

Extending prior results, we sandwich the repetition time in terms of unconditional and conditional min-entropies. The condition for the upper bound resembles short memory in the sense developed in time series analysis. Our reasonings make a repeated use of dualities between so called times and so called counts that generalize the duality of the recurrence time and the longest match length. We also discuss the analogy of these results with the Wyner-Ziv/Ornstein-Weiss theorem, which sandwiches the recurrence time in terms of Shannon entropies.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[FoundTS: Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11802v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management. While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that, in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings. Overall, foundation models can provide completely alternative approaches to traditional econometric methods, yet there are challenges to be tackled.</p></details> |  |

This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons.

This approach captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within sensor data, improving the accuracy of bearing fault detection under various conditions. Methodology: The proposed method converts time series sensor data into graph representations. GAT captures spatial relationships between components, while LSTM models temporal patterns. The model is validated using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Dataset, which includes data under different horsepower levels and both normal and faulty conditions. Its performance is compared with methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest) and GNN-based method for bearing fault detection (GNNBFD). Findings: The model achieved outstanding results, with precision, recall, and F1-scores reaching 100\% across various testing conditions. It not only identifies faults accurately but also generalizes effectively across different operational scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Originality: This research presents a unique combination of GAT and LSTM for fault detection, overcoming the limitations of traditional time series methods by capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Its superior performance demonstrates significant potential for predictive maintenance in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning with Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting using Low-Rank Adaptations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11539v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High computational power and the availability of large datasets have supported the development of Foundational Models. They are a new emerging technique widely used in Generative Artificial Intelligence, characterized by their scalability and their use in Transfer Learning. The enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training phase, known as pre-training, give them a higher generalization capacity than any other specific model, constituting a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes LLIAM, the Llama Lora-Integrated Autorregresive Model. Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposal, two sets of experiments have been carried out that obtained favorable and promising results with lower training times than other Deep Learning approaches. With this work, we also encourage the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional Artificial Intelligence and those specified by the definition of Green Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> |  |

This work combines the strengths of both to create fast surrogate models with adjustable complexity. By leveraging the VAE's dimensionality reduction using a non-hierarchical prior, our method adaptively assigns stochastic noise, naturally complementing known NeuralODE training enhancements and enabling probabilistic time series modeling. We show that standard Latent ODEs struggle with dimensionality reduction in systems with time-varying inputs. Our approach mitigates this by continuously propagating variational parameters through time, establishing fixed information channels in latent space. This results in a flexible and robust method that can learn different system complexities, e.g. deep neural networks or linear matrices. Hereby, it enables efficient approximation of the Koopman operator without the need for predefining its dimensionality. As our method balances dimensionality reduction and reconstruction accuracy, we call it Balanced Neural ODE (B-NODE). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on academic test cases and apply it to a real-world example of a thermal power plant.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper under review</p></details> |
| **[TADA: Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15174v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization aim to train models to effectively perform on samples that are unseen and outside of the distribution. Adversarial data augmentation (ADA) is a widely used technique in domain generalization. It enhances the model robustness by including synthetic samples designed to simulate potential unseen scenarios into the training datasets, which is then used to train the model. However, in time series data, traditional ADA approaches often fail to address distribution shifts related to temporal characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation (TADA) for time series data, which incorporate time warping into ADA. Although time warping is inherently non-differentiable, ADA relies on generating samples through backpropagation. We resolve this issue by leveraging the duality between phase shifts in the frequency domain and time shifts in the time domain, thereby making the process differentiable. Our evaluations across various time series datasets demonstrate that TADA outperforms existing methods for domain generalization. In addition, using distribution visualization, we confirmed that the distribution shifts induced by TADA are clearly different from those induced by ADA, and together, they effectively simulate real-world distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |

The research examines the proportion of female students, first-year enrollments, and degrees awarded to women in the field. The issue of low female participation in Informatics has long been recognized as a persistent challenge and remains a critical area of scholarly inquiry. Furthermore, existing literature indicates that socio-economic factors can unpredictably influence female participation, complicating efforts to address the gender gap. The analysis focuses on participation data from research universities at various academic levels, including Bachelors, Masters, and PhD programs, and seeks to uncover potential correlations between female participation and geographical or economic zones. The dataset was first enriched by integrating additional information, such as each country's GDP and relevant geographical data, sourced from various online repositories. Subsequently, the data was cleaned to ensure consistency and eliminate incomplete time series. A final set of complete time series was selected for further analysis. We then used the data collected from the internet to assign countries to different clusters. Specifically, we employed Economic Zone, Geographical Area, and GDP quartile to cluster countries and compare their temporal trends both within and between clusters. We analyze the results for each classification and derive conclusions based on the available data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Role of Delay in Brain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11384v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant variations of delays among connecting neurons cause an inevitable disadvantage of asynchronous brain dynamics compared to synchronous deep learning. However, this study demonstrates that this disadvantage can be converted into a computational advantage using a network with a single output and M multiple delays between successive layers, thereby generating a polynomial time-series outputs with M. The proposed role of delay in brain dynamics (RoDiB) model, is capable of learning increasing number of classified labels using a fixed architecture, and overcomes the inflexibility of the brain to update the learning architecture using additional neurons and connections. Moreover, the achievable accuracies of the RoDiB system are comparable with those of its counterpart tunable single delay architectures with M outputs. Further, the accuracies are significantly enhanced when the number of output labels exceeds its fully connected input size. The results are mainly obtained using simulations of VGG-6 on CIFAR datasets and also include multiple label inputs. However, currently only a small fraction of the abundant number of RoDiB outputs is utilized, thereby suggesting its potential for advanced computational power yet to be discovered.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Given the importance of stress monitoring for mental health, developing a highly reliable and accurate affective computing model is essential. In this context, we propose a novel model, for affective state prediction using physiological signals. PhysioFormer model integrates individual attributes and multimodal physiological data to address interindividual variability, enhancing its reliability and generalization across different individuals. By incorporating feature embedding and affective representation modules, PhysioFormer model captures dynamic changes in time-series data and multimodal signal features, significantly improving accuracy. The model also includes an explainability model that uses symbolic regression to extract laws linking physiological signals to affective states, increasing transparency and explainability. Experiments conducted on the Wrist and Chest subsets of the WESAD dataset confirmed the model's superior performance, achieving over 99% accuracy, outperforming existing SOTA models. Sensitivity and ablation experiments further demonstrated PhysioFormer's reliability, validating the contribution of its individual components. The integration of symbolic regression not only enhanced model explainability but also highlighted the complex relationships between physiological signals and affective states. Future work will focus on optimizing the model for larger datasets and real-time applications, particularly in more complex environments. Additionally, further exploration of physiological signals and environmental factors will help build a more comprehensive affective computing system, advancing its use in health monitoring and psychological intervention.</p></details> | 45 pages |

In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of explicitly modeling this periodicity to enhance the performance of models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique, which utilizes learnable recurrent cycles to model the inherent periodic patterns within sequences, and then performs predictions on the residual components of the modeled cycles. Combining RCF with a Linear layer or a shallow MLP forms the simple yet powerful method proposed in this paper, called CycleNet. CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in multiple domains including electricity, weather, and energy, while offering significant efficiency advantages by reducing over 90% of the required parameter quantity. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play technique, the RCF can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy of existing models, including PatchTST and iTransformer.

State-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on Transformer architectures, which utilize attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods are hindered by quadratic time complexity, limiting the model's scalability with respect to input sequence length. This significantly restricts their practicality in the real world. Mamba, based on state space models (SSM), provides a solution with linear time complexity, increasing the potential for efficient forecasting of sequential data. In this study, we propose UmambaTSF, a novel long-term time series forecasting framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of U-shaped encoder-decoder multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with Mamba's long sequence representation. To improve performance and efficiency, the Mamba blocks introduced in the framework adopt a refined residual structure and adaptable design, enabling the capture of unique temporal signals and flexible channel processing. In the experiments, UmambaTSF achieves state-of-the-art performance and excellent generality on widely used benchmark datasets while maintaining linear time complexity and low memory consumption.</p></details> |  |

This variability, which reflects critical fluctuations in patient health, is essential for informed clinical decision-making. Existing self-supervised learning research on irregular time series often relies on generic pretext tasks like forecasting, which may not fully utilise the signal provided by irregular time series. There is a significant need for specialised pretext tasks designed for the characteristics of irregular time series to enhance model performance and robustness, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. This paper proposes a novel pretraining framework, EMIT, an event-based masking for irregular time series. EMIT focuses on masking-based reconstruction in the latent space, selecting masking points based on the rate of change in the data. This method preserves the natural variability and timing of measurements while enhancing the model's ability to process irregular intervals without losing essential information. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet Challenge datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our event-based masking strategy.

| **[Can LLMs Understand Time Series Anomalies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05440v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, but their potential for anomaly detection remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates whether LLMs can understand and detect anomalies in time series data, focusing on zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Inspired by conjectures about LLMs' behavior from time series forecasting research, we formulate key hypotheses about LLMs' capabilities in time series anomaly detection. We design and conduct principled experiments to test each of these hypotheses. Our investigation reveals several surprising findings about LLMs for time series: 1. LLMs understand time series better as images rather than as text 2. LLMs did not demonstrate enhanced performance when prompted to engage in explicit reasoning about time series analysis 3. Contrary to common beliefs, LLM's understanding of time series do not stem from their repetition biases or arithmetic abilities 4. LLMs' behaviors and performance in time series analysis vary significantly across different model architectures This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of contemporary LLM capabilities in time series anomaly detection. Our results suggest that while LLMs can understand time series anomalies, many common conjectures based on their reasoning capabilities do not hold. Our code and data are available at `https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/AnomLLM/`.</p></details> |  |

Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNNs estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. These results are then used to demonstrate how asymptotic inference can be conducted on the finite dimensional parameter of a partially linear regression model after first-stage DNN estimation of infinite dimensional parameters. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</p></details> | 102 pages, 2 figures |

Here we endeavor to study the problem of detecting disruptions i.e. plasma instabilities that can cause significant damages, impairing the reliability and efficiency required for their real world viability. Machine learning (ML) prediction models have shown promise in detecting disruptions for specific tokamaks, but they often struggle in generalizing to the diverse characteristics and dynamics of different machines. This limits the effectiveness of ML models across different tokamak designs and operating conditions, which is a critical barrier to scaling fusion technology. Given the success of data augmentation in improving model robustness and generalizability in other fields, this study explores the use of a novel time series viewmaker network to generate diverse augmentations or "views" of training data. Our results show that incorporating views during training improves AUC and F2 scores on DisruptionBench tasks compared to standard or no augmentations. This approach represents a promising step towards developing more broadly applicable ML models for disruption avoidance, which is essential for advancing fusion technology and, ultimately, addressing climate change through reliable and sustainable energy production.</p></details> |  |

The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that extract dynamic and stochastic information from finite time-series data of complex systems. In this study, we introduce a new variant of LIM, called Colored-LIM, which models stochasticity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise. Despite the non-trivial correlation between observable and colored noise, we show that Colored-LIM unveils the desired information merely from the correlation function of the observable. Therefore, this approach not only accounts for the memory effects of environmental noise, traditionally represented by time-uncorrelated white noise in the Classical LIM framework, but does so using the same observation dataset without requiring additional data. Furthermore, we show that Colored-LIM does not reduce to Classical LIM in the white noise limit, underscoring the importance of temporal dependencies in stochastic systems. In this paper, we rigorously develop the Colored-LIM, explore its connections with the Classical LIM and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, and validate its effectiveness on both ideal linear and nonlinear systems. In addition, we illustrate the potential applications and implications of Colored-LIM for real-world problems, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and the electricity network of Tohoku University.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The approach employs a mixed Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to predict the monthly accumulations of daily detected active fire spots. Data analysis revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with annual maximum and minimum values tending to repeat at the same periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts capture this inherent seasonality through machine learning techniques. The methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data generalizes well to both the test and validation sets for both seeds. The results indicate that the combined LSTM and GRU model delivers excellent forecasting performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring, specifically in forecasting active fire spots. The proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to other time series forecasting challenges, opening new opportunities for research and development in machine learning and prediction of natural phenomena.

Despite the strong reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs, leveraging them for sensor data tasks remains largely unexplored. This gap stems from challenges like the lack of semantic context in time-series data, computational limitations, and LLMs' difficulty processing numerical inputs. To address these issues, we introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework to unlock LLMs' potential for sensor data tasks. In the Sensor-Language Alignment Stage, we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate trend-descriptive text to align sensor data with textual inputs, enabling SensorLLM to capture numerical changes, channel-specific information, and sensor data of varying lengths-capabilities that existing LLMs typically struggle with, all without the need for human annotations. Next, in Task-Aware Tuning Stage, we refine the model for HAR classification using the frozen LLM and alignment module, achieving performance on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art models. We further demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, enabling it to generalize across diverse datasets for HAR tasks. We strongly believe our work lays the stepstone for future time-series and text alignment research, offering a path toward foundation models for sensor data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transparent Networks for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10535v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent models, which are machine learning models that produce inherently interpretable predictions, are receiving significant attention in high-stakes domains. However, despite much real-world data being collected as time series, there is a lack of studies on transparent time series models. To address this gap, we propose a novel transparent neural network model for time series called Generalized Additive Time Series Model (GATSM). GATSM consists of two parts: 1) independent feature networks to learn feature representations, and 2) a transparent temporal module to learn temporal patterns across different time steps using the feature representations. This structure allows GATSM to effectively capture temporal patterns and handle dynamic-length time series while preserving transparency. Empirical experiments show that GATSM significantly outperforms existing generalized additive models and achieves comparable performance to black-box time series models, such as recurrent neural networks and Transformer. In addition, we demonstrate that GATSM finds interesting patterns in time series. The source code is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/GATSM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Practical Approach to Causal Inference over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10502v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on estimating the causal effect of an intervention over time on a dynamical system. To that end, we formally define causal interventions and their effects over time on discrete-time stochastic processes (DSPs). Then, we show under which conditions the equilibrium states of a DSP, both before and after a causal intervention, can be captured by a structural causal model (SCM). With such an equivalence at hand, we provide an explicit mapping from vector autoregressive models (VARs), broadly applied in econometrics, to linear, but potentially cyclic and/or affected by unmeasured confounders, SCMs. The resulting causal VAR framework allows us to perform causal inference over time from observational time series data. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves strong performance in terms of observational forecasting while enabling accurate estimation of the causal effect of interventions on dynamical systems. We demonstrate, through a case study, the potential practical questions that can be addressed using the proposed causal VAR framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10469v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance as zero-shot forecasters. However, achieving effectively unified training on time series remains an open challenge. Existing approaches introduce some level of model specialization to account for the highly heterogeneous nature of time series data. For instance, Moirai pursues unified training by employing multiple input/output projection layers, each tailored to handle time series at a specific frequency. Similarly, TimesFM maintains a frequency embedding dictionary for this purpose. We identify two major drawbacks to this human-imposed frequency-level model specialization: (1) Frequency is not a reliable indicator of the underlying patterns in time series. For example, time series with different frequencies can display similar patterns, while those with the same frequency may exhibit varied patterns. (2) Non-stationarity is an inherent property of real-world time series, leading to varied distributions even within a short context window of a single time series. Frequency-level specialization is too coarse-grained to capture this level of diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Moirai-MoE, using a single input/output projection layer while delegating the modeling of diverse time series patterns to the sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers. With these designs, Moirai-MoE reduces reliance on human-defined heuristics and enables automatic token-level specialization. Extensive experiments on 39 datasets demonstrate the superiority of Moirai-MoE over existing foundation models in both in-distribution and zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive model analyses to explore the inner workings of time series MoE foundation models and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 28 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models. The codebase, datasets, and a leaderboard showing all the results in detail will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional applications of decision trees that forecast time series directly, Hyper-Trees are designed to learn the parameters of time series models. Our framework combines the effectiveness of gradient boosted trees on tabular data with the advantages of established time series models, thereby naturally inducing a time series inductive bias to tree models. By relating the parameters of a target time series model to features, Hyper-Trees also address the issue of parameter non-stationarity. To resolve the inherent scaling issue of boosted trees when estimating a large number of target model parameters, we combine decision trees and neural networks within a unified framework. In this novel approach, the trees first generate informative representations from the input features, which a shallow network then maps to the target model parameters. With our research, we aim to explore the effectiveness of Hyper-Trees across various forecasting scenarios and to extend the application of gradient boosted trees outside their conventional use in time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forec...</summary><p>Forecasting, Gradient Boosting Machines, Hyper-Networks, Parameter Non-Stationarity, Time Series</p></details> |

This research transforms these time-series current signals into time-frequency 2D representations via Wavelet Transform (WT). The dataset for motor current signals includes 3,750 data points across five categories: one representing normal conditions and four representing artificially induced faults, each under five different load conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The study employs five WT-based techniques: WT-Amor, WT-Bump, WT-Morse, WSST-Amor, and WSST-Bump. Subsequently, five DL models adopting prior Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture were developed and tested using the transformed 2D plots from each method. The DL models for WT-Amor, WT-Bump, and WT-Morse showed remarkable effectiveness with peak model accuracy of 90.93, 89.20, and 93.73%, respectively, surpassing previous 2D-image-based methods that recorded accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80% respectively using the identical dataset and validation protocol. Notably, the WT-Morse approach slightly exceeded the formerly highest ML technique, achieving a 93.20% accuracy. However, the two WSST methods that utilized synchrosqueezing techniques faced difficulty accurately classifying motor faults. The performance of Wavelet-based deep learning methods offers a compelling alternative for machine condition monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 figures, presented at the 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 images, presented at 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |

Anomalies in web traffic signal unusual fluctuations in this data, making their detection crucial for ensuring network security. Deep neural network approaches for web traffic anomaly detection have achieved cutting-edge classification performance. However, since these methods are still insufficient in terms of classification effectiveness and speed, researching fast and accurate anomaly detection methods is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection model (WT-CFormer) specifically designed for web traffic, which innovatively use the Transformer to efficiently and accurately extract the temporal features of web traffic and deeply integrates the CNN to extract the spatial features of web traffic to improve the anomaly detection performance. In addition, we conduct a large number of experiments to prove the effectiveness and superiority of WT-CFormer for web traffic anomaly detection. In evaluation experiments, WT-CFormer has the highest performance, obtaining a recall as high as 96.79%, a precision of 97.35%, an F1 score of 97.07%, and an accuracy of 99.43%, which is 7.09%,1.15%, 4.77%, and 0.83% better than the state-of-the-art method, followed by C-LSTM, CTGA, random forest, and KNN algorithms. In addition, we find that the classification performance of WT-CFormer with only 50 training epochs outperforms C-LSTM with 500 training epochs, which greatly improves the convergence performance. Finally, we perform ablation experiments to demonstrate the necessity of each component within WT-CFormer.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 32 pages, 1 figure |
| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[StatioCL: Contrastive Learning for Time Series via Non-Stationary and Temporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10048v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for representation learning in time series data by embedding similar pairs closely while distancing dissimilar ones. However, existing CL methods often introduce false negative pairs (FNPs) by neglecting inherent characteristics and then randomly selecting distinct segments as dissimilar pairs, leading to erroneous representation learning, reduced model performance, and overall inefficiency. To address these issues, we systematically define and categorize FNPs in time series into semantic false negative pairs and temporal false negative pairs for the first time: the former arising from overlooking similarities in label categories, which correlates with similarities in non-stationarity and the latter from neglecting temporal proximity. Moreover, we introduce StatioCL, a novel CL framework that captures non-stationarity and temporal dependency to mitigate both FNPs and rectify the inaccuracies in learned representations. By interpreting and differentiating non-stationary states, which reflect the correlation between trends or temporal dynamics with underlying data patterns, StatioCL effectively captures the semantic characteristics and eliminates semantic FNPs. Simultaneously, StatioCL establishes fine-grained similarity levels based on temporal dependencies to capture varying temporal proximity between segments and to mitigate temporal FNPs. Evaluated on real-world benchmark time series classification datasets, StatioCL demonstrates a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods, achieving a 2.9% increase in Recall and a 19.2% reduction in FNPs. Most importantly, StatioCL also shows enhanced data efficiency and robustness against label scarcity.</p></details> | Accepted in CIKM24 |

These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. Existing models struggle with detecting and tracking concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. This paper introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into time series and proposes WormKAN, a KAN-based auto-encoder to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN integrates the KAN-SR module, in which the encoder, decoder, and self-representation layer are built on KAN, along with a temporal constraint to capture concept transitions. These transitions, akin to passing through a "wormhole", are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drifts.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, the application of Transformer-based Vision Transformer (ViT) methods to fault diagnosis is gaining attraction. Nonetheless, these methods typically require extensive preprocessing, which increases computational complexity, potentially reducing the efficiency of the diagnosis process. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the Time Series Vision Transformer (TSViT), tailored for effective fault diagnosis. TSViT incorporates a convolutional layer to extract local features from vibration signals, alongside a transformer encoder to discern long-term temporal patterns. A thorough experimental comparison on three diverse datasets demonstrates TSViT's effectiveness and adaptability. Moreover, the paper delves into the influence of hyperparameter tuning on the model's performance, computational demand, and parameter count. Remarkably, TSViT achieves an unprecedented 100% average accuracy on two test sets and 99.99% on another, showcasing its exceptional diagnostic capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time. In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pattern-Specific Experts for Time Series Forecasting Under Patch-level Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09836v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TFPS}, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach.

To tackle these challenges, we propose PatchMixer, a novel CNN-based model. It introduces a permutation-variant convolutional structure to preserve temporal information. Diverging from conventional CNNs in this field, which often employ multiple scales or numerous branches, our method relies exclusively on depthwise separable convolutions. This allows us to extract both local features and global correlations using a single-scale architecture. Furthermore, we employ dual forecasting heads encompassing linear and nonlinear components to better model future curve trends and details. Our experimental results on seven time-series forecasting benchmarks indicate that compared with the state-of-the-art method and the best-performing CNN, PatchMixer yields $3.9\%$ and $21.2\%$ relative improvements, respectively, while being 2-3x faster than the most advanced method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/Zeying-Gong/PatchMixer.

Methods: We conducted two clinical studies involving 58 prediabetic veterans and 60 patients with obstructive sleep apnea to gather multimodal behavioral data using wearable devices. We develop multimodal long short-term memory (LSTM) network models, which are capable of forecasting the number of step counts of a patient up to 24 hours in advance by examining data from activity and engagement modalities. Furthermore, we design goal-based forecasting models to predict whether a person's next-day steps will be over a certain threshold. Results: Multimodal LSTM with early fusion achieves 33% and 37% lower mean absolute errors than linear regression and ARIMA respectively on the prediabetes dataset. LSTM also outperforms linear regression and ARIMA with a margin of 13% and 32% on the sleep dataset. Multimodal forecasting models also perform with 72% and 79% accuracy on the prediabetes dataset and sleep dataset respectively on goal-based forecasting. Conclusion: Our experiments conclude that multimodal LSTM models with early fusion are better than multimodal LSTM with late fusion and unimodal LSTM models and also than ARIMA and linear regression models. Significance: We address an important and challenging task of time-series forecasting in uncontrolled environments. Effective forecasting of a person's physical activity can aid in designing adaptive behavioral interventions to keep the user engaged and adherent to a prescribed routine.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The majority of prior work in consistent topology estimation relies on dynamical systems excited by temporally uncorrelated processes. In this article, we present a novel algorithm for guaranteed topology learning of networks that are excited by temporally (colored) cyclostationary processes, which encompasses a wide range of temporal correlation including wide-sense stationarity. Furthermore, unlike prior work, the framework applies to linear dynamic system with complex valued dependencies, and leverages group lasso regularization for effective learning of the network structure. In the second part of the article, we analyze conditions for consistent topology learning for bidirected tree networks when a subset of the network is unobserved. Here, the full topology along with unobserved nodes are recovered from observed node's time-series alone.

Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[Adaptive higher order reversible integrators for memory efficient deep learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09537v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The depth of networks plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of deep learning. However, the memory requirement for backpropagation scales linearly with the number of layers, which leads to memory bottlenecks during training. Moreover, deep networks are often unable to handle time-series appearing at irregular intervals. These issues can be resolved by considering continuous-depth networks based on the neural ODE framework in combination with reversible integration methods that allow for variable time-steps. Reversibility of the method ensures that the memory requirement for training is independent of network depth, while variable time-steps are required for assimilating time-series data on irregular intervals. However, at present, there are no known higher-order reversible methods with this property. High-order methods are especially important when a high level of accuracy in learning is required or when small time-steps are necessary due to large errors in time integration of neural ODEs, for instance in context of complex dynamical systems such as Kepler systems and molecular dynamics. The requirement of small time-steps when using a low-order method can significantly increase the computational cost of training as well as inference. In this work, we present an approach for constructing high-order reversible methods that allow adaptive time-stepping. Our numerical tests show both the advantages in computational speed and improved training accuracy of the new networks when applied to the task of learning dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate the growing environmental challenges associated with data center energy consumption, optimizing the operation of IT equipment (ITE) and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems is crucial. Yet, modeling such systems is challenging due to the complex and non-linear interactions between many factors, including server load, indoor climate, weather, and data center configurations. While physical simulations are capable of representing this complexity, they are often time-consuming to set up and run. Machine Learning (ML), in contrast, allows efficient data-driven modeling but typically does not consider a system's causal dynamics, lacks interpretability, and suffers from overfitting. This study addresses the limitations of ML-driven predictive modeling by employing Causal Discovery to select features that are causally related to the response variable. We use a simulated data center to generate time series of its operation and conduct experiments to compare ML models trained with all features, traditional feature selection methods, and causal feature selection. Our results show that causal feature selection leads to models with substantially fewer features and similar or better performance, especially when predicting the effects of interventions. In addition, our proposed methodology allows the interpretation of the causal mechanism and the integration of expert knowledge into the modeling process. Overall, our findings suggest that combining Causal Discovery with ML can be a promising alternative for feature selection methods and prediction of interactions in complex physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM, or LagLlama have not yet been considered for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while the TimesFM foundation model outperforms all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> |  |

Although Transformer models have dramatically advanced the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift the focus from evaluating the overall Transformer architecture to specifically examining the effectiveness of self-attention for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models. The implementation of our model is available at: https://github.com/dongbeank/CATS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

| **[How Numerical Precision Affects Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13857v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, understanding and enhancing their mathematical capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of LLMs' mathematical abilities, with a specific focus on their arithmetic performances. We identify numerical precision as a key factor that influences their effectiveness in mathematical tasks. Our results show that Transformers operating with low numerical precision fail to address arithmetic tasks, such as iterated addition and integer multiplication, unless the model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In contrast, Transformers with standard numerical precision can efficiently handle these tasks with significantly smaller model sizes. We further support our theoretical findings through empirical experiments that explore the impact of varying numerical precision on arithmetic tasks, providing valuable insights for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multilingual LLM Evaluation for European Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08928v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing across numerous languages and tasks. However, evaluating LLM performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of language-parallel multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a multilingual evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC, EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K. The benchmarks and results are made publicly available to encourage further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active-Dormant Attention Heads: Mechanistically Demystifying Extreme-Token Phenomena in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13835v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners have consistently observed three puzzling phenomena in transformer-based large language models (LLMs): attention sinks, value-state drains, and residual-state peaks, collectively referred to as extreme-token phenomena. These phenomena are characterized by certain so-called "sink tokens" receiving disproportionately high attention weights, exhibiting significantly smaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those of other tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLM inference, quantization, and interpretability. We elucidate the mechanisms behind extreme-token phenomena. First, we show that these phenomena arise in very simple architectures -- transformers with one to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy (BB) task. In this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where attention heads become sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks for others. Our theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that these phenomena are driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on these insights, we propose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during pretraining, including replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next, we extend our analysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing that many attention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in the BB task, and that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence of extreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining. Our results reveal that many of the static and dynamic properties of extreme-token phenomena predicted by the BB task align with observations in pretrained LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16833v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced sufficiently, LC consistently outperforms RAG in terms of average performance. However, RAG's significantly lower cost remains a distinct advantage. Based on this observation, we propose Self-Route, a simple yet effective method that routes queries to RAG or LC based on model self-reflection. Self-Route significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining a comparable performance to LC. Our findings provide a guideline for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 industry track</p></details> |
| **[AgentOccam: A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for LLM-Based Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13825v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy via agents using large language models (LLMs) for personalized, standardized tasks boosts human efficiency. Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Future Conversation Turns to Teach LLMs to Ask Clarifying Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13788v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) must often respond to highly ambiguous user requests. In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. We observe existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we propose to assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in the future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. In experiments on open-domain QA, we compare systems that trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. We evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions that can recover each user's interpretation and expected answer, and find that our training with our proposed method trains LLMs to ask clarifying questions with a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid and Automated Alloy Design with Graph Neural Network-Powered LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13768v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic alloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights from physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Human Pipeline for Cultural Context Grounding of Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13727v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversations often adhere to well-understood social norms that vary across cultures. For example, while "addressing parents by name" is commonplace in the West, it is rare in most Asian cultures. Adherence or violation of such norms often dictates the tenor of conversations. Humans are able to navigate social situations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly. However, it is a hard task for NLP models. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations. It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc. We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs. We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements. We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework. We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation. Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Human Subjectivity in LLMs Using Explicit and Implicit Human Factors in Personas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14462v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in human-centered social scientific tasks, such as data annotation, synthetic data creation, and engaging in dialog. However, these tasks are highly subjective and dependent on human factors, such as one's environment, attitudes, beliefs, and lived experiences. Thus, it may be the case that employing LLMs (which do not have such human factors) in these tasks results in a lack of variation in data, failing to reflect the diversity of human experiences. In this paper, we examine the role of prompting LLMs with human-like personas and asking the models to answer as if they were a specific human. This is done explicitly, with exact demographics, political beliefs, and lived experiences, or implicitly via names prevalent in specific populations. The LLM personas are then evaluated via (1) subjective annotation task (e.g., detecting toxicity) and (2) a belief generation task, where both tasks are known to vary across human factors. We examine the impact of explicit vs. implicit personas and investigate which human factors LLMs recognize and respond to. Results show that explicit LLM personas show mixed results when reproducing known human biases, but generally fail to demonstrate implicit biases. We conclude that LLMs may capture the statistical patterns of how people speak, but are generally unable to model the complex interactions and subtleties of human perceptions, potentially limiting their effectiveness in social science applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Persistent Pre-Training Poisoning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13722v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are pre-trained on uncurated text datasets consisting of trillions of tokens scraped from the Web. Prior work has shown that: (1) web-scraped pre-training datasets can be practically poisoned by malicious actors; and (2) adversaries can compromise language models after poisoning fine-tuning datasets. Our work evaluates for the first time whether language models can also be compromised during pre-training, with a focus on the persistence of pre-training attacks after models are fine-tuned as helpful and harmless chatbots (i.e., after SFT and DPO). We pre-train a series of LLMs from scratch to measure the impact of a potential poisoning adversary under four different attack objectives (denial-of-service, belief manipulation, jailbreaking, and prompt stealing), and across a wide range of model sizes (from 600M to 7B). Our main result is that poisoning only 0.1% of a model's pre-training dataset is sufficient for three out of four attacks to measurably persist through post-training. Moreover, simple attacks like denial-of-service persist through post-training with a poisoning rate of only 0.001%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unconstrained Model Merging for Enhanced LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13699v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in building domain-specific large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, especially in tasks requiring reasoning abilities like logical inference over complex relationships and multi-step problem solving. However, creating a powerful all-in-one LLM remains challenging due to the need for proprietary data and vast computational resources. As a resource-friendly alternative, we explore the potential of merging multiple expert models into a single LLM. Existing studies on model merging mainly focus on generalist LLMs instead of domain experts, or the LLMs under the same architecture and size. In this work, we propose an unconstrained model merging framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous model architectures with a focus on reasoning tasks. A fine-grained layer-wise weight merging strategy is designed for homogeneous models merging, while heterogeneous model merging is built upon the probabilistic distribution knowledge derived from instruction-response fine-tuning data. Across 7 benchmarks and 9 reasoning-optimized LLMs, we reveal key findings that combinatorial reasoning emerges from merging which surpasses simple additive effects. We propose that unconstrained model merging could serve as a foundation for decentralized LLMs, marking a notable progression from the existing centralized LLM framework. This evolution could enhance wider participation and stimulate additional advancement in the field of artificial intelligence, effectively addressing the constraints posed by centralized models.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Understanding and Mitigating Language Confusion in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20052v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a surprising limitation of LLMs: their inability to consistently generate text in a user's desired language. We create the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB) to evaluate such failures, covering 15 typologically diverse languages with existing and newly-created English and multilingual prompts. We evaluate a range of LLMs on monolingual and cross-lingual generation reflecting practical use cases, finding that Llama Instruct and Mistral models exhibit high degrees of language confusion and even the strongest models fail to consistently respond in the correct language. We observe that base and English-centric instruct models are more prone to language confusion, which is aggravated by complex prompts and high sampling temperatures. We find that language confusion can be partially mitigated via few-shot prompting, multilingual SFT and preference tuning. We release our language confusion benchmark, which serves as a first layer of efficient, scalable multilingual evaluation at https://github.com/for-ai/language-confusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Main Conference Camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Jailbreaking LLM-Controlled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13691v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics by enabling contextual reasoning and intuitive human-robot interaction in domains as varied as manipulation, locomotion, and self-driving vehicles. When viewed as a stand-alone technology, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein malicious prompters elicit harmful text by bypassing LLM safety guardrails. To assess the risks of deploying LLMs in robotics, in this paper, we introduce RoboPAIR, the first algorithm designed to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots. Unlike existing, textual attacks on LLM chatbots, RoboPAIR elicits harmful physical actions from LLM-controlled robots, a phenomenon we experimentally demonstrate in three scenarios: (i) a white-box setting, wherein the attacker has full access to the NVIDIA Dolphins self-driving LLM, (ii) a gray-box setting, wherein the attacker has partial access to a Clearpath Robotics Jackal UGV robot equipped with a GPT-4o planner, and (iii) a black-box setting, wherein the attacker has only query access to the GPT-3.5-integrated Unitree Robotics Go2 robot dog. In each scenario and across three new datasets of harmful robotic actions, we demonstrate that RoboPAIR, as well as several static baselines, finds jailbreaks quickly and effectively, often achieving 100% attack success rates. Our results reveal, for the first time, that the risks of jailbroken LLMs extend far beyond text generation, given the distinct possibility that jailbroken robots could cause physical damage in the real world. Indeed, our results on the Unitree Go2 represent the first successful jailbreak of a deployed commercial robotic system. Addressing this emerging vulnerability is critical for ensuring the safe deployment of LLMs in robotics. Additional media is available at: https://robopair.org</p></details> |  |
| **[SimpleToM: Exposing the Gap between Explicit ToM Inference and Implicit ToM Application in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13648v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While prior work has explored whether large language models (LLMs) possess a "theory of mind" (ToM) - the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others - there has been little work testing whether LLMs can implicitly apply such knowledge to predict behavior, or to judge whether an observed behavior is rational. Such skills are critical for appropriate interaction in social environments. We create a new dataset, SimpleTom, containing concise, diverse stories (e.g., "The can of Pringles has moldy chips in it. Mary picks up the can in the supermarket and walks to the cashier."), each with three questions that test different degrees of ToM reasoning, asking models to predict (a) mental state ("Is Mary aware of the mold?"), (b) behavior ("Will Mary pay for the chips or report the mold?"), and (c) judgment ("Mary paid for the chips. Was that reasonable?"). To our knowledge, SimpleToM is the first dataset to systematically explore downstream reasoning requiring knowledge of mental states in realistic scenarios. Our experimental results are intriguing: While most models can reliably predict mental state on our dataset (a), they often fail to correctly predict the behavior (b), and fare even worse at judging whether given behaviors are reasonable (c), despite being correctly aware of the protagonist's mental state should make such secondary predictions obvious. We further show that we can help models do better at (b) and (c) via interventions such as reminding the model of its earlier mental state answer and mental-state-specific chain-of-thought prompting, raising the action prediction accuracies (e.g., from 49.5% to 93.5% for GPT-4o) and judgment accuracies (e.g., from 15.3% to 94.7% in GPT-4o). While this shows that models can be coaxed to perform well, it requires task-specific interventions, and the natural model performances remain low, a cautionary tale for LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Space Chain-of-Embedding Enables Output-free LLM Self-Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13640v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM self-evaluation relies on the LLM's own ability to estimate response correctness, which can greatly improve its deployment reliability. In this research track, we propose the Chain-of-Embedding (CoE) in the latent space to enable LLMs to perform output-free self-evaluation. CoE consists of all progressive hidden states produced during the inference time, which can be treated as the latent thinking path of LLMs. We find that when LLMs respond correctly and incorrectly, their CoE features differ, these discrepancies assist us in estimating LLM response correctness. Experiments in four diverse domains and seven LLMs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Meanwhile, its label-free design intent without any training and millisecond-level computational cost ensure real-time feedback in large-scale scenarios. More importantly, we provide interesting insights into LLM response correctness from the perspective of hidden state changes inside LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[FairMindSim: Alignment of Behavior, Emotion, and Belief in Humans and LLM Agents Amid Ethical Dilemmas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10398v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI alignment is a pivotal issue concerning AI control and safety. It should consider not only value-neutral human preferences but also moral and ethical considerations. In this study, we introduced FairMindSim, which simulates the moral dilemma through a series of unfair scenarios. We used LLM agents to simulate human behavior, ensuring alignment across various stages. To explore the various socioeconomic motivations, which we refer to as beliefs, that drive both humans and LLM agents as bystanders to intervene in unjust situations involving others, and how these beliefs interact to influence individual behavior, we incorporated knowledge from relevant sociological fields and proposed the Belief-Reward Alignment Behavior Evolution Model (BREM) based on the recursive reward model (RRM). Our findings indicate that, behaviorally, GPT-4o exhibits a stronger sense of social justice, while humans display a richer range of emotions. Additionally, we discussed the potential impact of emotions on behavior. This study provides a theoretical foundation for applications in aligning LLMs with altruistic values.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeNTi: Bridging Medical Calculator and LLM Agent with Nested Tool Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13610v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating tools into Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the widespread application. Despite this, in specialized downstream task contexts, reliance solely on tools is insufficient to fully address the complexities of the real world. This particularly restricts the effective deployment of LLMs in fields such as medicine. In this paper, we focus on the downstream tasks of medical calculators, which use standardized tests to assess an individual's health status. We introduce MeNTi, a universal agent architecture for LLMs. MeNTi integrates a specialized medical toolkit and employs meta-tool and nested calling mechanisms to enhance LLM tool utilization. Specifically, it achieves flexible tool selection and nested tool calling to address practical issues faced in intricate medical scenarios, including calculator selection, slot filling, and unit conversion. To assess the capabilities of LLMs for quantitative assessment throughout the clinical process of calculator scenarios, we introduce CalcQA. This benchmark requires LLMs to use medical calculators to perform calculations and assess patient health status. CalcQA is constructed by professional physicians and includes 100 case-calculator pairs, complemented by a toolkit of 281 medical tools. The experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements with our framework. This research paves new directions for applying LLMs in demanding scenarios of medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human and LLM Biases in Hate Speech Annotations: A Socio-Demographic Analysis of Annotators and Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07991v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of online platforms exacerbated the spread of hate speech, demanding scalable and effective detection. However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Unit Test Generation via Property Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13542v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, with Large Language Models (LLMs) recently showing significant potential. Moreover, in the context of unit test generation, these tools prioritize high code coverage, often at the expense of practical usability, correctness, and maintainability. In response, we propose Property-Based Retrieval Augmentation, a novel mechanism that extends LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) beyond basic vector, text similarity, and graph-based methods. Our approach considers task-specific context and introduces a tailored property retrieval mechanism. Specifically, in the unit test generation task, we account for the unique structure of unit tests by dividing the test generation process into Given, When, and Then phases. When generating tests for a focal method, we not only retrieve general context for the code under test but also consider task-specific context such as pre-existing tests of other methods, which can provide valuable insights for any of the Given, When, and Then phases. This forms property relationships between focal method and other methods, thereby expanding the scope of retrieval beyond traditional RAG. We implement this approach in a tool called APT, which sequentially performs preprocessing, property retrieval, and unit test generation, using an iterative strategy where newly generated tests guide the creation of subsequent ones. We evaluated APT on 12 open-source projects with 1515 methods, and the results demonstrate that APT consistently outperforms existing tools in terms of correctness, completeness, and maintainability of the generated tests. Moreover, we introduce a novel code-context-aware retrieval mechanism for LLMs beyond general context, offering valuable insights and potential applications for other code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Cognitive Models of Students with Misconceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12294v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling student cognition is crucial for developing effective AI-driven educational technologies. A key challenge is creating realistic student models that satisfy two essential properties: (1) accurately replicating specific misconceptions, and (2) correctly solving problems where these misconceptions are not applicable. This dual requirement reflects the complex nature of student understanding, where misconceptions coexist with correct knowledge. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be instruction-tuned to meet this dual requirement and effectively simulate student thinking in algebra. We introduce MalAlgoPy, a novel Python library that generates datasets reflecting authentic student solution patterns through a graph-based representation of algebraic problem-solving. Utilizing MalAlgoPy, we define and examine Cognitive Student Models (CSMs) - LLMs instruction tuned to faithfully emulate realistic student behavior. Our findings reveal that LLMs trained on misconception examples can efficiently learn to replicate errors. However, the training diminishes the model's ability to solve problems correctly, particularly for problem types where the misconceptions are not applicable, thus failing to satisfy second property of CSMs. We demonstrate that by carefully calibrating the ratio of correct to misconception examples in the training data - sometimes as low as 0.25 - it is possible to develop CSMs that satisfy both properties. Our insights enhance our understanding of AI-based student models and pave the way for effective adaptive learning systems.</p></details> |  |

While many studies have examined these biases, little work has explored their robustness during interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach where two instances of an LLM engage in self-debate, arguing opposing viewpoints to persuade a neutral version of the model. Through this, we evaluate how firmly biases hold and whether models are susceptible to reinforcing misinformation or shifting to harmful viewpoints. Our experiments span multiple LLMs of varying sizes, origins, and languages, providing deeper insights into bias persistence and flexibility across linguistic and cultural contexts.</p></details> |  |

However, large language models (LLMs), especially open-source models, often perform poorly in generating informative questions, as measured by expected information gain (EIG). In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the informativeness of LLM-generated questions in 20-question game dialogues. We sample multiple questions from the same model (LLAMA 2-CHAT 7B) for each game and create pairs of low-EIG and high-EIG questions to apply a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our results show that this method produces more effective questions (in terms of EIG), even in domains different from those used to train the DPO model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13461v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout. Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing research lacks a focus on preemptive evaluation of reasoning trajectories performed by LLM agents, leading to a gap in ensuring safe and reliable operations. To explore better solutions, this paper introduces InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to proactively detect potential errors before risky actions are executed (e.g., `buy-now' in automatic online trading or web shopping). InferAct acts as a human proxy, detecting unsafe actions and alerting users for intervention, which helps prevent irreversible risks in time and enhances the actor agent's decision-making process. Experiments on three widely-used tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of InferAct, presenting a novel solution for safely developing LLM agents in environments involving critical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly available to enable further research in this important area.</p></details> |  |

However, many users remain unaware of the risks. This paper explores methods to increase user awareness of privacy risks associated with LLMs in end-user applications. We conducted five co-design workshops to uncover user privacy concerns and their demand for contextual privacy information within LLMs. Based on these insights, we developed CLEAR (Contextual LLM-Empowered Privacy Policy Analysis and Risk Generation), a just-in-time contextual assistant designed to help users identify sensitive information, summarize relevant privacy policies, and highlight potential risks when sharing information with LLMs. We evaluated the usability and usefulness of CLEAR across in two example domains: ChatGPT and the Gemini plugin in Gmail. Our findings demonstrated that CLEAR is easy to use and improves user understanding of data practices and privacy risks. We also discussed LLM's duality in posing and mitigating privacy risks, offering design and policy implications.</p></details> |  |

Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs typically lack personalized recommendations and diagnosis analysis in sophisticated medical applications, causing hallucinations and performance bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MedAide, an LLM-based omni medical multi-agent collaboration framework for specialized healthcare services. Specifically, MedAide first performs query rewriting through retrieval-augmented generation to accomplish accurate medical intent understanding. Immediately, we devise a contextual encoder to obtain intent prototype embeddings, which are used to recognize fine-grained intents by similarity matching. According to the intent relevance, the activated agents collaborate effectively to provide integrated decision analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on four medical benchmarks with composite intents. Experimental results from automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show that MedAide outperforms current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency and strategic reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM-b...</summary><p>LLM-based Multi-Agent Collaboration for Medical Applications</p></details> |

To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news tends to generate higher returns in bull markets, whereas focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets.

Despite ongoing efforts to combat these scams, scammers continue to adapt and refine their tactics, making it imperative to explore innovative countermeasures. This research explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide detection of fraudulent phone calls. By analyzing the conversational dynamics between scammers and victims, LLM-based detectors can identify potential scams as they occur, offering immediate protection to users. While such approaches demonstrate promising results, we also acknowledge the challenges of biased datasets, relatively low recall, and hallucinations that must be addressed for further advancement in this field</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure |

An Evaluation of Shortcut Challenges in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13343v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs may rely on dataset biases as shortcuts for prediction, which can significantly impair their robustness and generalization capabilities. This paper presents Shortcut Suite, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the impact of shortcuts on LLMs' performance, incorporating six shortcut types, five evaluation metrics, and four prompting strategies. Our extensive experiments yield several key findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate varying reliance on shortcuts for downstream tasks, significantly impairing their performance. 2) Larger LLMs are more likely to utilize shortcuts under zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning prompts. 3) Chain-of-thought prompting notably reduces shortcut reliance and outperforms other prompting strategies, while few-shot prompts generally underperform compared to zero-shot prompts. 4) LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their predictions, especially when dealing with datasets that contain shortcuts. 5) LLMs generally have a lower explanation quality in shortcut-laden datasets, with errors falling into three types: distraction, disguised comprehension, and logical fallacy. Our findings offer new insights for evaluating robustness and generalization in LLMs and suggest potential directions for mitigating the reliance on shortcuts.

Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

Analyzing Ethical Biases and Jailbreak Vulnerabilities in AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13334v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in various tasks, they present potential safety risks, such as `jailbreaks', where malicious inputs can coerce LLMs into generating harmful content. To address these issues, many LLM developers have implemented various safety measures to align these models. This alignment involves several techniques, including data filtering during pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and red-teaming exercises. These methods often introduce deliberate and intentional biases similar to Political Correctness (PC) to ensure the ethical behavior of LLMs. In this paper, we delve into the intentional biases injected into LLMs for safety purposes and examine methods to circumvent these safety alignment techniques. Notably, these intentional biases result in a jailbreaking success rate in GPT-4o models that differs by 20% between non-binary and cisgender keywords and by 16% between white and black keywords, even when the other parts of the prompts are identical. We introduce the concept of PCJailbreak, highlighting the inherent risks posed by these safety-induced biases. Additionally, we propose an efficient defense method PCDefense, which prevents jailbreak attempts by injecting defense prompts prior to generation. PCDefense stands as an appealing alternative to Guard Models, such as Llama-Guard, that require additional inference cost after text generation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for LLM developers to adopt a more responsible approach when designing and implementing safety measures.</p></details> |  |

Students need help in a variety of tasks, ranging from information-seeking to requiring support with course assignments. To explore the utility of recent large language models (LLMs) as a support mechanism, we developed an LLM-powered AI chatbot that augments the answers that are produced with information from the course materials. To study the effect of the LLM-powered AI chatbot, we conducted a lab-based user study (N=14), in which the participants worked on tasks from a web software development course. The participants were divided into two groups, where one of the groups first had access to the chatbot and then to a more traditional search functionality, while another group started with the search functionality and was then given the chatbot. We assessed the participants' performance and perceptions towards the chatbot and the search functionality and explored their preferences towards the support functionalities. Our findings highlight that both support mechanisms are seen as useful and that support mechanisms work well for specific tasks, while less so for other tasks. We also observe that students tended to prefer the second support mechanism more, where students who were first given the chatbot tended to prefer the search functionality and vice versa.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

First, we compute LLM embeddings for emotion labels and apply non-parametric clustering to group similar labels, across multiple datasets containing disjoint labels. We use these cluster centers to map music features (MERT) to the LLM embedding space. To further enhance the model, we introduce an alignment regularization that enables dissociation of MERT embeddings from different clusters. This further enhances the model's ability to better adaptation to unseen datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by performing zero-shot inference on a new dataset, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen labels without additional training.</p></details> |  |

Yet its quadratic complexity limits the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, especially for those with a long-context window. A promising approach addressing this limitation is to leverage the sparsity in attention. However, existing sparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or heuristics to approximate sparsity. This practice falls short to fully capture the dynamic nature of attention sparsity in language-based tasks. This paper argues that attention sparsity should be learned rather than predefined. To this end, we design SeerAttention, a new Attention mechanism that augments the conventional attention with a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in an attention map and deems the rest blocks sparse. Such block-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speedup. To enable efficient learning of the gating network, we develop a customized FlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth of attention map with minimum overhead. SeerAttention not only applies to post-training, but also excels in long-context fine-tuning. Our results show that at post-training stages, SeerAttention significantly outperforms state-of-the-art static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods, while also being more versatile and flexible to adapt to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios. When applied to long-context fine-tuning with YaRN, SeerAttention can achieve a remarkable 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context length with minimal perplexity loss, offering a 5.67x speedup over FlashAttention-2.</p></details> |  |

This problem is very challenging, because it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial representation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often invisible. In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital for the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation. With the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting baseline is to prompt LLMs to "react" on each observation and make decisions accordingly. However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent often repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic workflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan. Specifically, we find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of landmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation. Moreover, reflection is achieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can be retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation. Planning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid short-sighted decisions in long-range navigation. We show the designed workflow significantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

We propose density-aware post-training weight-only quantization (DAQ), which has two stages: 1) density-centric alignment, which identifies the center of high-density weights and centers the dynamic range on this point to align high-density weight regions with floating-point high-precision regions; 2) learnable dynamic range adjustment, which adjusts the dynamic range by optimizing quantization parameters (i.e., scale and zero-point) based on the impact of weights on the model output. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2 show that DAQ consistently outperforms the best baseline method, reducing perplexity loss by an average of 22.8% on LLaMA and 19.6% on LLaMA-2.

Confidence calibration, which estimates the underlying uncertainty of model predictions, is essential to enhance the LLMs' trustworthiness. Existing research on LLM calibration has primarily focused on short-form tasks, providing a single confidence score at the response level (macro calibration). However, this approach is insufficient for long-form generations, where responses often contain more complex statements and may include both accurate and inaccurate information. Therefore, we introduce atomic calibration, a novel approach that evaluates factuality calibration at a fine-grained level by breaking down long responses into atomic claims. We classify confidence elicitation methods into discriminative and generative types and demonstrate that their combination can enhance calibration. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs and datasets show that atomic calibration is well-suited for long-form generation and can also improve macro calibration results. Additionally, atomic calibration reveals insightful patterns in LLM confidence throughout the generation process.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks, which can be categorized as knowledge-intensive tasks and alignment-required tasks. Previous approaches either ignore the latter task or focus on a minority of tasks and hence lose generalization. To address these drawbacks, we propose a progressive fine-tuning pipeline. This pipeline employs a Knowledge Aggregator and a Noise aggregator to encode diverse knowledge in the first stage and filter out detrimental information. In the second stage, we drop the Noise Aggregator to avoid the interference of suboptimal representation and leverage an additional alignment module optimized towards an orthogonal direction to the knowledge space to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Based on this two-stage paradigm, we proposed a Medical LLM through decoupling Clinical Alignment and Knowledge Aggregation (MedCare), which is designed to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, as well as SOTA results on specific medical alignment tasks. Various model sizes of MedCare (1.8B, 7B, 14B) all demonstrate significant improvements over existing models with similar model sizes.</p></details> | EMNLP2024 Findings |

However, existing evaluations of hallucinations in LLM-generated summaries, and evaluations of hallucination detection models both suffer from a lack of diversity and recency in the LLM and LLM families considered. This paper introduces FaithBench, a summarization hallucination benchmark comprising challenging hallucinations made by 10 modern LLMs from 8 different families, with ground truth annotations by human experts. ``Challenging'' here means summaries on which popular, state-of-the-art hallucination detection models, including GPT-4o-as-a-judge, disagreed on. Our results show GPT-4o and GPT-3.5-Turbo produce the least hallucinations. However, even the best hallucination detection models have near 50\% accuracies on FaithBench, indicating lots of room for future improvement.

Their limited context awareness can lead to overlooking critical information and subsequent task failures. While several approaches have been proposed to enhance LLMs' context awareness, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency remains challenging. In this paper, for LLMs utilizing RoPE as position embeddings, we introduce a novel method called "Mixture of In-Context Experts" (MoICE) to address this challenge. MoICE comprises two key components: a router integrated into each attention head within LLMs and a lightweight router-only training optimization strategy: (1) MoICE views each RoPE angle as an `in-context' expert, demonstrated to be capable of directing the attention of a head to specific contextual positions. Consequently, each attention head flexibly processes tokens using multiple RoPE angles dynamically selected by the router to attend to the needed positions. This approach mitigates the risk of overlooking essential contextual information. (2) The router-only training strategy entails freezing LLM parameters and exclusively updating routers for only a few steps. When applied to open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral, MoICE surpasses prior methods across multiple tasks on long context understanding and generation, all while maintaining commendable inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips2024</p></details> |

However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,5 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, incorrect understanding of the sentence to be translated can degrade translation quality. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Iterative Bilingual Understanding Translation (IBUT) method based on the cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs and the dual characteristics of translation tasks. The cross-lingual capability of LLMs enables the generation of contextual understanding for both the source and target languages separately. Furthermore, the dual characteristics allow IBUT to generate effective cross-lingual feedback, iteratively refining contextual understanding, thereby reducing errors and improving translation performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed IBUT outperforms several strong comparison methods, especially being generalized to multiple domains (e.g., news, commonsense, and cultural translation benchmarks).</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. To overcome the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better evaluates translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance. Our evaluation study reveals that existing large language models fall short in this task. To evaluate these issues, we propose RAT, a Retrieval-Augmented machine Translation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Our dataset and code will be made available.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, these models can be expensive to query in real-time and do not allow for a community-specific approach to content moderation. To address these challenges, we explore the use of open-source small language models (SLMs) for community-specific content moderation tasks. We fine-tune and evaluate SLMs (less than 15B parameters) by comparing their performance against much larger open- and closed-sourced models. Using 150K comments from 15 popular Reddit communities, we find that SLMs outperform LLMs at content moderation -- 11.5% higher accuracy and 25.7% higher recall on average across all communities. We further show the promise of cross-community content moderation, which has implications for new communities and the development of cross-platform moderation techniques.

Poisoned data is hard to detect, breaks guardrails, and leads to undesirable and harmful behavior. Given the intense efforts by leading labs to train and deploy increasingly larger and more capable LLMs, it is critical to ask if the risk of data poisoning will be naturally mitigated by scale, or if it is an increasing threat. We consider three threat models by which data poisoning can occur: malicious fine-tuning, imperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination. Our experiments evaluate the effects of data poisoning on 23 frontier LLMs ranging from 1.5-72 billion parameters, on three datasets which speak to each of our threat models. We find that larger LLMs are increasingly vulnerable, learning harmful behavior significantly quicker than smaller LLMs with even minimal data poisoning. Additionally, we demonstrate that even frontier GPT models, despite additional moderation systems, remain susceptible to data poisoning. These results underscore the need for robust safeguards against data poisoning in larger LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This work explores using LLM-generated feedback to improve summary quality by aligning the summaries with human preferences for faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness. We introduce FeedSum, a large-scale dataset containing multi-dimensional LLM feedback on summaries of varying quality across diverse domains. Our experiments show how feedback quality, dimensionality, and granularity influence preference learning, revealing that high-quality, multi-dimensional, fine-grained feedback significantly improves summary generation. We also compare two methods for using this feedback: supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Finally, we introduce SummLlama3-8b, a model that outperforms the nearly 10x larger Llama3-70b-instruct in generating human-preferred summaries, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve superior performance with appropriate training. The full dataset will be released soon. The SummLlama3-8B model is now available at https://huggingface.co/DISLab/SummLlama3-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17169v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human feedback. The labeling process is the most labor-intensive and costly part of the alignment pipeline, and improving its efficiency would have a meaningful impact on AI development. We propose a strategy for sampling a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the most informative response pairs for labeling out of a set of AI-generated responses. Experimental results on synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. We also applied our method to the real-world dataset SHP2, selecting optimal pairs from multiple responses. The model aligned on dissimilar response pairs obtained the best win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on less similar pairs can improve the efficiency of LLM alignment, saving up to 65% of annotators' work.</p></details> |  |

We instructed nine popular LLMs to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to provide a performance baseline. For each incorrectly answered question, we instructed eight types of self-reflecting LLM agents to reflect on their mistakes and provide themselves with guidance to improve problem-solving. Then, using this guidance, each self-reflecting agent attempted to re-answer the same questions. Our results indicate that LLM agents are able to significantly improve their problem-solving performance through self-reflection ($p < 0.001$). In addition, we compared the various types of self-reflection to determine their individual contribution to performance.

However, current PI methods face prohibitively higher communication and latency overheads, primarily due to nonlinear operations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis to understand the role of nonlinearities in transformer-based decoder-only language models. We introduce AERO, a four-step architectural optimization framework that refines the existing LLM architecture for efficient PI by systematically removing nonlinearities such as LayerNorm and GELU and reducing FLOPs counts. For the first time, we propose a Softmax-only architecture with significantly fewer FLOPs tailored for efficient PI. Furthermore, we devise a novel entropy regularization technique to improve the performance of Softmax-only models. AERO achieves up to 4.23$\times$ communication and 1.94$\times$ latency reduction. We validate the effectiveness of AERO by benchmarking it against the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 21 figures, and 9 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.09637</p></details> |

In this paper, we make three key contributions: (1) we propose an uncertainty quantification (UQ) performance measure tailored for data annotation tasks, (2) we compare, for the first time, five different UQ strategies across three distinct LLMs and CSS data annotation tasks, (3) we introduce a novel UQ aggregation strategy that effectively identifies low-confidence LLM annotations and disproportionately uncovers data incorrectly labeled by the LLMs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed UQ aggregation strategy improves upon existing methods andcan be used to significantly improve human-in-the-loop data annotation processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypothesis Testing the Circuit Hypothesis in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13032v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate surprising capabilities, but we do not understand how they are implemented. One hypothesis suggests that these capabilities are primarily executed by small subnetworks within the LLM, known as circuits. But how can we evaluate this hypothesis? In this paper, we formalize a set of criteria that a circuit is hypothesized to meet and develop a suite of hypothesis tests to evaluate how well circuits satisfy them. The criteria focus on the extent to which the LLM's behavior is preserved, the degree of localization of this behavior, and whether the circuit is minimal. We apply these tests to six circuits described in the research literature. We find that synthetic circuits -- circuits that are hard-coded in the model -- align with the idealized properties. Circuits discovered in Transformer models satisfy the criteria to varying degrees. To facilitate future empirical studies of circuits, we created the \textit{circuitry} package, a wrapper around the \textit{TransformerLens} library, which abstracts away lower-level manipulations of hooks and activations. The software is available at \url{https://github.com/blei-lab/circuitry}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available here: https://github.com/blei-lab/circuitry</p></details> |
| **[Codellm-Devkit: A Framework for Contextualizing Code LLMs with Program Analysis Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13007v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (or code LLMs) are increasingly gaining popularity and capabilities, offering a wide array of functionalities such as code completion, code generation, code summarization, test generation, code translation, and more. To leverage code LLMs to their full potential, developers must provide code-specific contextual information to the models. These are typically derived and distilled using program analysis tools. However, there exists a significant gap--these static analysis tools are often language-specific and come with a steep learning curve, making their effective use challenging. These tools are tailored to specific program languages, requiring developers to learn and manage multiple tools to cover various aspects of the their code base. Moreover, the complexity of configuring and integrating these tools into the existing development environments add an additional layer of difficulty. This challenge limits the potential benefits that could be gained from more widespread and effective use of static analysis in conjunction with LLMs. To address this challenge, we present codellm-devkit (hereafter, `CLDK'), an open-source library that significantly simplifies the process of performing program analysis at various levels of granularity for different programming languages to support code LLM use cases. As a Python library, CLDK offers developers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it incredibly easy to provide rich program analysis context to code LLMs. With this library, developers can effortlessly integrate detailed, code-specific insights that enhance the operational efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs in coding tasks. CLDK is available as an open-source library at https://github.com/IBM/codellm-devkit.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Chain Ensembles for Scalable and Accurate Data Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13006v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot classification makes them viable solutions for data annotation in rapidly evolving domains where quality labeled data is often scarce and costly to obtain. However, the large-scale deployment of LLMs can be prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces an LLM chain ensemble methodology that aligns multiple LLMs in a sequence, routing data subsets to subsequent models based on classification uncertainty. This approach leverages the strengths of individual LLMs within a broader system, allowing each model to handle data points where it exhibits the highest confidence, while forwarding more complex cases to potentially more robust models. Our results show that the chain ensemble method often exceeds the performance of the best individual model in the chain and achieves substantial cost savings, making LLM chain ensembles a practical and efficient solution for large-scale data annotation challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Processes: Numerical Predictive Distributions Conditioned on Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12856v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses. Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Translating and Classifying Mental Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12985v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in medical fields. In mental health support, the early identification of linguistic markers associated with mental health conditions can provide valuable support to mental health professionals, and reduce long waiting times for patients. Despite the benefits of LLMs for mental health support, there is limited research on their application in mental health systems for languages other than English. Our study addresses this gap by focusing on the detection of depression severity in Greek through user-generated posts which are automatically translated from English. Our results show that GPT3.5-turbo is not very successful in identifying the severity of depression in English, and it has a varying performance in Greek as well. Our study underscores the necessity for further research, especially in languages with less resources. Also, careful implementation is necessary to ensure that LLMs are used effectively in mental health platforms, and human supervision remains crucial to avoid misdiagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoTree: Adaptive Tree-based Video Representation for LLM Reasoning on Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19209v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form video understanding has been a challenging task due to the high redundancy in video data and the abundance of query-irrelevant information. To tackle this challenge, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multigranularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our training-free method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms the existing training-free approaches on the popular EgoSchema and NExT-QA benchmarks with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average 44 minutes), the training-free VideoTree framework achieves better performance than the strong proprietary GPT-4V model and other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, first three authors contributed equally; Project page: https://videotree2024.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Multi-turn Function Calling for LLMs via Compositional Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12952v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant potential in performing diverse tasks, including the ability to call functions or use external tools to enhance their performance. While current research on function calling by LLMs primarily focuses on single-turn interactions, this paper addresses the overlooked necessity for LLMs to engage in multi-turn function calling--critical for handling compositional, real-world queries that require planning with functions but not only use functions. To facilitate this, we introduce an approach, BUTTON, which generates synthetic compositional instruction tuning data via bottom-up instruction construction and top-down trajectory generation. In the bottom-up phase, we generate simple atomic tasks based on real-world scenarios and build compositional tasks using heuristic strategies based on atomic tasks. Corresponding functions are then developed for these compositional tasks. The top-down phase features a multi-agent environment where interactions among simulated humans, assistants, and tools are utilized to gather multi-turn function calling trajectories. This approach ensures task compositionality and allows for effective function and trajectory generation by examining atomic tasks within compositional tasks. We produce a dataset BUTTONInstruct comprising 8k data points and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in LLMs by Stepwise Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12934v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Best-of-N decoding methods instruct large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple solutions, score each using a scoring function, and select the highest scored as the final answer to mathematical reasoning problems. However, this repeated independent process often leads to the same mistakes, making the selected solution still incorrect. We propose a novel prompting method named Stepwise Correction (StepCo) that helps LLMs identify and revise incorrect steps in their generated reasoning paths. It iterates verification and revision phases that employ a process-supervised verifier. The verify-then-revise process not only improves answer correctness but also reduces token consumption with fewer paths needed to generate. With StepCo, a series of LLMs demonstrate exceptional performance. Notably, using GPT-4o as the backend LLM, StepCo achieves an average accuracy of 94.1 across eight datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art Best-of-N method by +2.4, while reducing token consumption by 77.8%.</p></details> | under review |

We present Constituent-Aware Pooling (CAP), a methodology designed to analyse how LLMs process compositional linguistic structures. Grounded in principles of compositionality, mechanistic interpretability, and information gain theory, CAP systematically intervenes in model activations through constituent-based pooling at various model levels. Our experiments on inverse definition modelling, hypernym and synonym prediction reveal critical insights into transformers' limitations in handling compositional abstractions. No specific layer integrates tokens into unified semantic representations based on their constituent parts. We observe fragmented information processing, which intensifies with model size, suggesting that larger models struggle more with these interventions and exhibit greater information dispersion. This fragmentation likely stems from transformers' training objectives and architectural design, preventing systematic and cohesive representations. Our findings highlight fundamental limitations in current transformer architectures regarding compositional semantics processing and model interpretability, underscoring the critical need for novel approaches in LLM design to address these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 Figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12784v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge's alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g., GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges.

Robot controllers usually need to be specified by experts on a case-by-case basis via programming code. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and unable to take into account all situations that may be encountered during deployment. On the other hand, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated reasoning and planning capabilities, introduced new ways to interact with and program machines, and incorporate both domain-specific and commonsense knowledge. Hence, we propose to address the aforementioned challenges by integrating LLMs with robot swarms and show the potential in proofs of concept (showcases). For this integration, we explore two approaches. The first approach is 'indirect integration,' where LLMs are used to synthesize and validate the robot controllers. This approach may reduce development time and human error before deployment. Moreover, during deployment, it could be used for on-the-fly creation of new robot behaviors. The second approach is 'direct integration,' where each robot locally executes a separate LLM instance during deployment for robot-robot collaboration and human-swarm interaction. These local LLM instances enable each robot to reason, plan, and collaborate using natural language, as demonstrated in our showcases where the robots are able to detect a variety of anomalies, without prior information about the nature of these anomalies. To enable further research on our mainly conceptual contribution, we release the software and videos for our LLM2Swarm system: https://github.com/Pold87/LLM2Swarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Open-World Agents</p></details> |

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SplitLLM: Collaborative Inference of LLMs for Model Placement and Throughput Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10759v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been a disruptive innovation in recent years, and they play a crucial role in our daily lives due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Their capabilities include natural language understanding, information retrieval and search, translation, chatbots, virtual assistance, and many more. However, it is well known that LLMs are massive in terms of the number of parameters. Additionally, the self-attention mechanism in the underlying architecture of LLMs, Transformers, has quadratic complexity in terms of both computation and memory with respect to the input sequence length. For these reasons, LLM inference is resource-intensive, and thus, the throughput of LLM inference is limited, especially for the longer sequences. In this report, we design a collaborative inference architecture between a server and its clients to alleviate the throughput limit. In this design, we consider the available resources on both sides, i.e., the computation and communication costs. We develop a dynamic programming-based algorithm to optimally allocate computation between the server and the client device to increase the server throughput, while not violating the service level agreement (SLA). We show in the experiments that we are able to efficiently distribute the workload allowing for roughly 1/3 reduction in the server workload, while achieving 19 percent improvement over a greedy method. As a result, we are able to demonstrate that, in an environment with different types of LLM inference requests, the throughput of the server is improved.</p></details> |  |

Decentralized training faces significant challenges regarding system design and efficiency, including: 1) the need for remote automatic differentiation (RAD), 2) support for flexible model definitions and heterogeneous software, 3) heterogeneous hardware leading to low resource utilization or the straggler problem, and 4) slow network communication. To address these challenges, in the system design, we represent the model as a directed acyclic graph of operators (OP-DAG). Each node in the DAG represents the operator in the DNNs, while the edge represents the data dependency between operators. Based on this design, 1) users are allowed to customize any DNN without caring low-level operator implementation; 2) we enable the task scheduling with the more fine-grained sub-tasks, offering more optimization space; 3) a DAG runtime executor can implement RAD withour requiring the consistent low-level ML framework versions. To enhance system efficiency, we implement a workload estimator and design an OP-Fence scheduler to cluster devices with similar bandwidths together and partition the DAG to increase throughput. Additionally, we propose an AdaTopK compressor to adaptively compress intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. To evaluate the convergence and efficiency of our system and algorithms, we train ResNet-101 and GPT-2 on three real-world testbeds using 48 GPUs connected with 8 Mbps~10 Gbps networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system and method can achieve 1.45 - 9.39x speedup compared to baseline methods while ensuring convergence.</p></details> |  |

These annotations can be costly to produce, error-prone, and require both domain and annotation expertise. With advances in LLMs, we hypothesize that unlabeled data and a schema definition are sufficient for building a working task-oriented dialogue system, completely unsupervised. We consider a novel unsupervised setting of only (1) a well-defined API schema (2) a set of unlabeled dialogues between a user and agent. We propose an innovative approach using expectation-maximization (EM) that infers turn-level annotations as latent variables using a noisy channel model to build an end-to-end dialogue agent. Evaluating our approach on the MultiWOZ benchmark, our method more than doubles the dialogue success rate of a strong GPT-3.5 baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2024). 18 Pages, 8 Figures</p></details> |

However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Graph Descriptive Order Affect Solving Graph Problems with LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07140v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research typically focuses on controlling single attributes, leaving the compositional control of multiple attributes underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CCSBench, a benchmark for compositional controllable summarization in the scientific domain. Our benchmark enables fine-grained control over both explicit attributes (e.g., length), which are objective and straightforward, and implicit attributes (e.g., empirical focus), which are more subjective and conceptual. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our findings reveal significant limitations in large language models' ability to balance trade-offs between control attributes, especially implicit ones that require deeper understanding and abstract reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Risk of Evidence Pollution for Malicious Social Text Detection in the Era of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12600v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evidence-enhanced detectors present remarkable abilities in identifying malicious social text with related evidence. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) brings potential risks of evidence pollution to confuse detectors. This paper explores how to manipulate evidence, simulating potential misuse scenarios including basic pollution, and rephrasing or generating evidence by LLMs. To mitigate its negative impact, we propose three defense strategies from both the data and model sides, including machine-generated text detection, a mixture of experts, and parameter updating. Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets present that evidence pollution, especially the generate strategy, significantly compromises existing detectors. On the other hand, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment, such as the need for annotated data and huge inference costs. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence is of high quality, would compromise the model calibration, and could ensemble to amplify the negative impact.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a new LLM decision-making framework called STRUX, which enhances LLM decision-making by providing structured explanations. These include favorable and adverse facts related to the decision, along with their respective strengths. STRUX begins by distilling lengthy information into a concise table of key facts. It then employs a series of self-reflection steps to determine which of these facts are pivotal, categorizing them as either favorable or adverse in relation to a specific decision. Lastly, we fine-tune an LLM to identify and prioritize these key facts to optimize decision-making. STRUX has been evaluated on the challenging task of forecasting stock investment decisions based on earnings call transcripts and demonstrated superior performance against strong baselines. It enhances decision transparency by allowing users to understand the impact of different factors, representing a meaningful step towards practical decision-making with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Robust RL with LLM-Driven Data Synthesis and Policy Adaptation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12568v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems demonstrates strong common sense and reasoning abilities, effectively addressing the pitfalls of purely data-driven methods. Current LLM-based agents require lengthy inference times and face challenges in interacting with real-time autonomous driving environments. A key open question is whether we can effectively leverage the knowledge from LLMs to train an efficient and robust Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This paper introduces RAPID, a novel \underline{\textbf{R}}obust \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive \underline{\textbf{P}}olicy \underline{\textbf{I}}nfusion and \underline{\textbf{D}}istillation framework, which trains specialized mix-of-policy RL agents using data synthesized by an LLM-based driving agent and online adaptation. RAPID features three key designs: 1) utilization of offline data collected from an LLM agent to distil expert knowledge into RL policies for faster real-time inference; 2) introduction of robust distillation in RL to inherit both performance and robustness from LLM-based teacher; and 3) employment of a mix-of-policy approach for joint decision decoding with a policy adapter. Through fine-tuning via online environment interaction, RAPID reduces the forgetting of LLM knowledge while maintaining adaptability to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPID's capability to effectively integrate LLM knowledge into scaled-down RL policies in an efficient, adaptable, and robust way. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Comparative Trap: Pairwise Comparisons Amplifies Biased Preferences of LLM Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12319v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators for natural language generation tasks, ensuring unbiased assessments is essential. However, LLM evaluators often display biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and authoritative tones. Our empirical analysis reveals that these biases are exacerbated in pairwise evaluation, where LLMs directly compare two outputs and easily prioritize superficial attributes. In contrast, pointwise evaluation, which assesses outputs independently, is less susceptible to such bias because each output is judged in isolation. To address the limitations of the pairwise evaluation, we introduce a novel evaluation method, PRePair, which integrates pointwise reasoning within a pairwise framework. PRePair effectively alleviates biased preference, improving performance on the adversarial benchmark (LLMBar) while outperforming pointwise evaluation on the standard benchmark (MT-Bench).</p></details> |  |

But do RAG implementations leave out important information when answering queries that need an integrated analysis of information (e.g., Tell me good news in the stock market today.)? To address these concerns, RAG developers need to annotate information retrieval (IR) data for their domain of interest, which is challenging because (1) domain-specific queries usually need nuanced definitions of relevance beyond shallow semantic relevance; and (2) human or GPT-4 annotation is costly and cannot cover all (query, document) pairs (i.e., annotation selection bias), thus harming the effectiveness in evaluating IR recall. To address these challenges, we propose DIRAS (Domain-specific Information Retrieval Annotation with Scalability), a manual-annotation-free schema that fine-tunes open-sourced LLMs to consider nuanced relevance definition and annotate (partial) relevance labels with calibrated relevance scores. Extensive evaluation shows that DIRAS enables smaller (8B) LLMs to achieve GPT-4-level performance on annotating and ranking unseen (query, document) pairs, and is helpful for real-world RAG development. All code, LLM generations, and human annotations can be found in \url{https://github.com/EdisonNi-hku/DIRAS}.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can help people by generating ideas or producing higher quality work, like many other AI tools they may risk causing a variety of harms, disproportionately burdening historically marginalized groups. In this work, we introduce and evaluate perceptual harm, a term for the harm caused to users when others perceive or suspect them of using AI. We examined perceptual harms in three online experiments, each of which entailed human participants evaluating the profiles for fictional freelance writers. We asked participants whether they suspected the freelancers of using AI, the quality of their writing, and whether they should be hired. We found some support for perceptual harms against for certain demographic groups, but that perceptions of AI use negatively impacted writing evaluations and hiring outcomes across the board.</p></details> |  |
| **[RosePO: Aligning LLM-based Recommenders with Human Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12519v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems, which usually adapt a pre-trained LLM to the recommendation scenario through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both the pre-training and SFT stages fail to explicitly model the comparative relationships of a user's preferences on different items. To construct a "helpful and harmless" LLM-based recommender, we propose a general framework -- Recommendation with smoothing personalized Preference Optimization (RosePO), which better aligns with customized human values during the post-training stage. Specifically, in addition to the input and chosen response that naturally align with SFT data, we design a rejected sampling strategy tailored for enhancing helpfulness, along with two strategies aimed at mitigating biases to promote harmlessness. To ensure robustness against uncertain labels present in automatically constructed preference data, we introduce a personalized smoothing factor predicted by a preference oracle into the optimization objective. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, showcasing not only improved recommendation performance but also mitigation of semantic hallucination and popularity bias.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a methodology for generating a bias detection dataset using seven bias triggers: General Debate, Positioned Debate, Career Advice, Story Generation, Problem-Solving, Cover-Letter Writing, and CV Generation. We use GPT-4o to generate a diverse set of prompts for each trigger across various genders, religious and racial groups. We evaluate models from Llama and Gemma family on the generated dataset. We anonymise the LLM-generated text associated with each group using GPT-4o-mini and do a pairwise comparison using GPT-4o-as-a-Judge. To quantify bias in the LLM-generated text we use the number of wins and losses in the pairwise comparison. Our analysis spans three languages, English, German, and Arabic to explore how language influences bias manifestation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit strong polarization toward certain groups across each category, with a notable consistency observed across models. However, when switching languages, variations and anomalies emerge, often attributable to cultural cues and contextual differences.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08688v4)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-agent workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the response generation module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 80.40% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</p></details> | Preprint |

When facing complex environments where their zero-shot abilities are insufficient, recent work showed online Reinforcement Learning (RL) could be used for the LLM agent to discover and learn efficient strategies interactively. However, most prior work sticks to on-policy algorithms, which greatly reduces the scope of methods such agents could use for both exploration and exploitation, such as experience replay and hindsight relabeling. Yet, such methods may be key for LLM learning agents, and in particular when designing autonomous intrinsically motivated agents sampling and pursuing their own goals (i.e. autotelic agents). This paper presents and studies an adaptation of Soft Actor-Critic and hindsight relabeling to LLM agents. Our method not only paves the path towards autotelic LLM agents that learn online but can also outperform on-policy methods in more classic multi-goal RL environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[KcMF: A Knowledge-compliant Framework for Schema and Entity Matching with Fine-tuning-free LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12480v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schema and entity matching tasks are crucial for data integration and management. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in these tasks, they suffer from hallucinations and confusion about task instructions. In this paper, we present the Knowledge-Compliant Matching Framework (KcMF), an LLM-based approach that addresses these issues without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. KcMF employs a pseudo-code-based task decomposition strategy to adopt task-specific natural language statements that guide LLM reasoning and reduce confusion. We also propose two mechanisms, Dataset as Knowledge (DaK) and Example as Knowledge (EaK), to build domain knowledge sets when unstructured domain knowledge is lacking. Additionally, we introduce a result-ensembling strategy to leverage multiple knowledge sources and suppress poorly formatted outputs. Comprehensive evaluations on schema and entity matching tasks demonstrate that KcMF outperforms previous non-LLM state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by an average F1 score of 22.9% and competes effectively with SOTA fine-tuned LLMs. Moreover, KcMF generalizes well across different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, crowd-sourcing is often expensive and can lack quality, especially for non-trivial tasks. We propose a method of using LLMs as few-shot learners for annotating data in a complex natural language task where we learn a standalone model to predict usage options for products from customer reviews. We also propose a new evaluation metric for this scenario, HAMS4, that can be used to compare a set of strings with multiple reference sets. Learning a custom model offers individual control over energy efficiency and privacy measures compared to using the LLM directly for the sequence-to-sequence task. We compare this data annotation approach with other traditional methods and demonstrate how LLMs can enable considerable cost savings. We find that the quality of the resulting data exceeds the level attained by third-party vendor services and that GPT-4-generated labels even reach the level of domain experts. We make the code and generated labels publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Notably, the disconnect between quantitative improvements on the overly academic leaderboard benchmarks and the qualitative impact of the models should be addressed. Furthermore, the benchmark suite is largely composed of translated versions of their English counterparts, which may not fully capture the intricacies of the Korean language. To address these issues, we propose Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2, an improved version of the earlier Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard. The original benchmarks are entirely replaced with new tasks that are more closely aligned with real-world capabilities. Additionally, four new native Korean benchmarks are introduced to better reflect the distinct characteristics of the Korean language. Through these refinements, Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard2 seeks to provide a more meaningful evaluation for advancing Korean LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Benchmark and Assessment: An Agent-based Exploratory Dynamic Evaluation Framework for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11507v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While various vertical domain large language models (LLMs) have been developed, the challenge of automatically evaluating their performance across different domains remains significant. Current benchmark-based evaluation methods exhibit rigid, aimless interactions and rely on pre-collected static datasets that are costly to build, inflexible across domains, and misaligned with practical user needs. To address this issue, we revisit the evaluation components and introduce two concepts: Benchmark+, which extends traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible "strategy-criterion" format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights. These concepts capture the nuanced behaviors of LLMs through richer, multi-turn interactions. We propose an agent-based evaluation framework called TestAgent, which implements these concepts through retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing vertical domain evaluation to activating existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent across various scenarios. We believe this work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Free Video-LLM: Prompt-guided Visual Perception for Efficient Training-free Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10441v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language large models have achieved remarkable success in various multi-modal tasks, yet applying them to video understanding remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and computational demands of video data. While training-based video-LLMs deliver high performance, they often require substantial resources for training and inference. Conversely, training-free approaches offer a more efficient alternative by adapting pre-trained image-LLMs models for video tasks without additional training, but they face inference efficiency bottlenecks due to the large number of visual tokens generated from video frames. In this work, we present a novel prompt-guided visual perception framework (abbreviated as Free Video-LLM) for efficient inference of training-free video LLMs. The proposed framework decouples spatial-temporal dimension and performs temporal frame sampling and spatial RoI cropping respectively based on task-specific prompts. Our method effectively reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining high performance across multiple video question-answering benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results with significantly fewer tokens, offering an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. The code will be available at https://github.com/contrastive/FreeVideoLLM.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[ProSA: Assessing and Understanding the Prompt Sensitivity of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12405v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance is highly sensitive to the prompts utilized. This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce ProSA, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, PromptSensiScore, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that higher model confidence correlates with increased prompt robustness. We believe this work will serve as a helpful tool in studying prompt sensitivity of LLMs. The project is released at: https://github.com/open-compass/ProSA .</p></details> | EMNLP 2024, Findings |

However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks. However, due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs, their practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues, this paper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator equipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's procedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be re-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives. We implement MobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and evaluate its performance on a dataset of 185 tasks across 18 mobile apps. The results indicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.7% accuracy, and is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.75%) accuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.5% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to the GPT-4 powered baseline.</p></details> |  |

Persuasion and Anti-Social Behavior of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Role of LLMs in Multimodal Evaluation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12329v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been accompanied by the development of various benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, the true nature of these evaluations and the extent to which they assess multimodal reasoning versus merely leveraging the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) backbone remain unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of LLM backbones in MLLM evaluation, focusing on two critical aspects: the degree to which current benchmarks truly assess multimodal reasoning and the influence of LLM prior knowledge on performance. Specifically, we introduce a modified evaluation protocol to disentangle the contributions of the LLM backbone from multimodal integration, and an automatic knowledge identification technique for diagnosing whether LLMs equip the necessary knowledge for corresponding multimodal questions. Our study encompasses four diverse MLLM benchmarks and eight state-of-the-art MLLMs. Key findings reveal that some benchmarks allow high performance even without visual inputs and up to 50\% of error rates can be attributed to insufficient world knowledge in the LLM backbone, indicating a heavy reliance on language capabilities. To address knowledge deficiencies, we propose a knowledge augmentation pipeline that achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to 60\% on certain datasets, resulting in a approximately 4x increase in performance. Our work provides crucial insights into the role of the LLM backbone in MLLMs, and highlights the need for more nuanced benchmarking approaches.</p></details> |  |

Traditional fingerprinting methods often require significant computational overhead or white-box verification access. In this paper, we introduce UTF, a novel and efficient approach to fingerprinting LLMs by leveraging under-trained tokens. Under-trained tokens are tokens that the model has not fully learned during its training phase. By utilizing these tokens, we perform supervised fine-tuning to embed specific input-output pairs into the model. This process allows the LLM to produce predetermined outputs when presented with certain inputs, effectively embedding a unique fingerprint. Our method has minimal overhead and impact on model's performance, and does not require white-box access to target model's ownership identification. Compared to existing fingerprinting methods, UTF is also more effective and robust to fine-tuning and random guess.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we explore how evaluation of different nations change when LLMs are assigned specific nationality personas. We assign 193 different nationality personas (e.g., an American person) to four LLMs and examine how the LLM evaluations (or ''perceptions'')of countries change. We find that all LLM-persona combinations tend to favor Western European nations, though nation-personas push LLM behaviors to focus more on and treat the nation-persona's own region more favorably. Eastern European, Latin American, and African nations are treated more negatively by different nationality personas. We additionally find that evaluations by nation-persona LLMs of other nations correlate with human survey responses but fail to match the values closely. Our study provides insight into how biases and stereotypes are realized within LLMs when adopting different national personas. In line with the ''Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights'', our findings underscore the critical need for developing mechanisms to ensure that LLM outputs promote fairness and avoid over-generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print, Under review</p></details> |

Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models (LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text corpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii) trained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from transferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep learning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical observations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text domain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We observe with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is positively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the original pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity observations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of tokens that are not informative about the domain. We hope these findings will guide us in determining when to adapt a model vs when to rely on its foundational capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Activation intervention has emerged as an effective and economical method to modify the behavior of LLMs. Despite considerable interest in this area, current intervention methods exclusively employ a fixed steering vector to modify model activations, lacking adaptability to diverse input semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention (SADI), a novel method that constructs a dynamic steering vector to intervene model activations at inference time. More specifically, SADI utilizes activation differences in contrastive pairs to precisely identify critical elements of an LLM (i.e., attention heads, hidden states, and neurons) for targeted intervention. During inference, SADI dynamically steers model behavior by scaling element-wise activations based on the directions of input semantics. Experimental results show that SADI outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, improving task performance without training. SADI's cost-effectiveness and generalizability across various LLM backbones and tasks highlight its potential as a versatile alignment technique. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line:https://github.com/weixuan-wang123/SADI.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process. Experimental results on datasets like MSR-VTT, MSVD, and ActivityNet demonstrate that MERLIN substantially improves Recall@1, outperforming existing systems and confirming the benefits of integrating LLMs into multimodal retrieval systems for more responsive and context-aware multimedia retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track Accepted (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

Unfortunately, these models share a weakness with their human counterparts: producing code that inadvertently has security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized attackers to access sensitive data or systems, which is unacceptable for safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Feedback-Driven Security Patching (FDSP), where LLMs automatically refine generated, vulnerable code. Our approach leverages automatic static code analysis to empower the LLM to generate and implement potential solutions to address vulnerabilities. We address the research communitys needs for safe code generation by introducing a large-scale dataset, PythonSecurityEval, covering the diversity of real-world applications, including databases, websites and operating systems. We empirically validate that FDSP outperforms prior work that uses self-feedback from LLMs by up to 17.6% through our procedure that injects targeted, external feedback.

| **[A Practice-Friendly LLM-Enhanced Paradigm with Preference Parsing for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00333v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training paradigm integrating large language models (LLM) is gradually reshaping sequential recommender systems (SRS) and has shown promising results. However, most existing LLM-enhanced methods rely on rich textual information on the item side and instance-level supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to inject collaborative information into LLM, which is inefficient and limited in many applications. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes a practice-friendly LLM-enhanced paradigm with preference parsing (P2Rec) for SRS. Specifically, in the information reconstruction stage, we design a new user-level SFT task for collaborative information injection with the assistance of a pre-trained SRS model, which is more efficient and compatible with limited text information. Our goal is to let LLM learn to reconstruct a corresponding prior preference distribution from each user's interaction sequence, where LLM needs to effectively parse the latent category of each item and the relationship between different items to accomplish this task. In the information augmentation stage, we feed each item into LLM to obtain a set of enhanced embeddings that combine collaborative information and LLM inference capabilities. These embeddings can then be used to help train various future SRS models. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our TSLRec on three SRS benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining. The source codes and benchmarks are available at \url{https://github.com/wlydlut/UHDDIP}.</p></details> |  |

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed TCN and alignment smoothing operation.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

In this paper, we present Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method to quantify changes in image deep features under varying degradation conditions. Specifically, our approach facilitates flexible and adaptive degradation, enabling the controlled synthesis of image degradation through text-driven prompts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[A Preliminary Exploration Towards General Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15143v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the tremendous success of deep models in various individual image restoration tasks, there are at least two major technical challenges preventing these works from being applied to real-world usages: (1) the lack of generalization ability and (2) the complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation. At last, we also try to understand and interpret these models' behaviors to inspire the future direction. Our work can open up new valuable research directions and contribute to the research of general vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Pre-training: Towards Efficient and Scalable All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02154v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tackles different types of degradations with a unified model instead of having task-specific, non-generic models for each degradation. The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models. The source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/akshaydudhane16/DyNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updates where the DyNet variants now share the same weights during inference as well, eliminating the need to store separate weights and thereby reducing device storage requirements.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TANet: Triplet Attention Network for All-In-One Adverse Weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08177v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |

Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly.

However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods.

We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction.

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

A prominent example of this framework is Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). However, in recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of a higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing score-matching along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our approach outperforms GAN-style imitation learning baselines across various continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids to walk, sit, and crawl.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to help address such challenges in diffusion models by developing an \textit{influence functions} framework. Influence function-based data attribution methods approximate how a model's output would have changed if some training data were removed. In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we systematically develop K-FAC approximations based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models. We recast previously proposed methods as specific design choices in our framework and show that our recommended method outperforms previous data attribution approaches on common evaluations, such as the Linear Data-modelling Score (LDS) or retraining without top influences, without the need for method-specific hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models.

| **[ConsisSR: Delving Deep into Consistency in Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13807v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims at restoring high-quality (HQ) images from low-quality (LQ) inputs corrupted by unknown and complex degradations. In particular, pretrained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models provide strong generative priors to reconstruct credible and intricate details. However, T2I generation focuses on semantic consistency while Real-ISR emphasizes pixel-level reconstruction, which hinders existing methods from fully exploiting diffusion priors. To address this challenge, we introduce ConsisSR to handle both semantic and pixel-level consistency. Specifically, compared to coarse-grained text prompts, we exploit the more powerful CLIP image embedding and effectively leverage both modalities through our Hybrid Prompt Adapter (HPA) for semantic guidance. Secondly, we introduce Time-aware Latent Augmentation (TALA) to mitigate the inherent gap between T2I generation and Real-ISR consistency requirements. By randomly mixing LQ and HQ latent inputs, our model not only handle timestep-specific diffusion noise but also refine the accumulated latent representations. Last but not least, our GAN-Embedding strategy employs the pretrained Real-ESRGAN model to refine the diffusion start point. This accelerates the inference process to 10 steps while preserving sampling quality, in a training-free manner. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance among both full-scale and accelerated models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13770v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theory on Score-Mismatched Diffusion Models and Zero-Shot Conditional Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13746v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising diffusion model has recently emerged as a powerful generative technique, capable of transforming noise into meaningful data. While theoretical convergence guarantees for diffusion models are well established when the target distribution aligns with the training distribution, practical scenarios often present mismatches. One common case is in zero-shot conditional diffusion sampling, where the target conditional distribution is different from the (unconditional) training distribution. These score-mismatched diffusion models remain largely unexplored from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we present the first performance guarantee with explicit dimensional dependencies for general score-mismatched diffusion samplers, focusing on target distributions with finite second moments. We show that score mismatches result in an asymptotic distributional bias between the target and sampling distributions, proportional to the accumulated mismatch between the target and training distributions. This result can be directly applied to zero-shot conditional samplers for any conditional model, irrespective of measurement noise. Interestingly, the derived convergence upper bound offers useful guidance for designing a novel bias-optimal zero-shot sampler in linear conditional models that minimizes the asymptotic bias. For such bias-optimal samplers, we further establish convergence guarantees with explicit dependencies on dimension and conditioning, applied to several interesting target distributions, including those with bounded support and Gaussian mixtures. Our findings are supported by numerical studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Convergence Rate for Diffusion Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13738v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical performance in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for their ability to generate high-quality new data instances from complex distributions. Improving our understanding of diffusion models, including mainly convergence analysis for such models, has attracted a lot of interests. Despite a lot of theoretical attempts, there still exists significant gap between theory and practice. Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work. This convergence analysis is based on a randomized midpoint method, which is first proposed for log-concave sampling (Shen and Lee, 2019), and then extended to diffusion models by Gupta et al. (2024). Our theory accommodates $\varepsilon$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity on the target distribution. Moreover, the algorithm can also be parallelized to run in only $O(\log^2(d/\varepsilon))$ parallel rounds in a similar way to prior works.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[DAWN: Dynamic Frame Avatar with Non-autoregressive Diffusion Framework for Talking Head Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13726v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (Dynamic frame Avatar With Non-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components: (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models.

| **[Diffusion Curriculum: Synthetic-to-Real Generative Curriculum Learning via Image-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13674v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-quality or scarce data has posed significant challenges for training deep neural networks in practice. While classical data augmentation cannot contribute very different new data, diffusion models opens up a new door to build self-evolving AI by generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, text-only guidance cannot control synthetic images' proximity to the original images, resulting in out-of-distribution data detrimental to the model performance. To overcome the limitation, we study image guidance to achieve a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. With stronger image guidance, the generated images are similar to the training data but hard to learn. While with weaker image guidance, the synthetic images will be easier for model but contribute to a larger distribution gap with the original data. The generated full spectrum of data enables us to build a novel "Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL)". DisCL adjusts the image guidance level of image synthesis for each training stage: It identifies and focuses on hard samples for the model and assesses the most effective guidance level of synthetic images to improve hard data learning. We apply DisCL to two challenging tasks: long-tail (LT) classification and learning from low-quality data. It focuses on lower-guidance images of high-quality to learn prototypical features as a warm-up of learning higher-guidance images that might be weak on diversity or quality. Extensive experiments showcase a gain of 2.7% and 2.1% in OOD and ID macro-accuracy when applying DisCL to iWildCam dataset. On ImageNet-LT, DisCL improves the base model's tail-class accuracy from 4.4% to 23.64% and leads to a 4.02% improvement in all-class accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Aligned Diffusion Planner for Quadrupedal Locomotion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13586v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex distributions from large-scale datasets, providing a promising solution for quadrupedal locomotion control. However, offline policy is sensitive to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) states due to the limited state coverage in the datasets. In this work, we propose a two-stage learning framework combining offline learning and online preference alignment for legged locomotion control. Through the offline stage, the diffusion planner learns the joint distribution of state-action sequences from expert datasets without using reward labels. Subsequently, we perform the online interaction in the simulation environment based on the trained offline planer, which significantly addresses the OOD issues and improves the robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel weak preference labeling method without the ground-truth reward or human preferences. The proposed method exhibits superior stability and velocity tracking accuracy in pacing, trotting, and bounding gait under both slow- and high-speed scenarios and can perform zero-shot transfer to the real Unitree Go1 robots.

| **[Context-Aware Full Body Anonymization using Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08551v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymization plays a key role in protecting sensible information of individuals in real world datasets. Self-driving cars for example need high resolution facial features to track people and their viewing direction to predict future behaviour and react accordingly. In order to protect people's privacy whilst keeping important features in the dataset, it is important to replace the full body of a person with a highly detailed anonymized one. In contrast to doing face anonymization, full body replacement decreases the ability of recognizing people by their hairstyle or clothes. In this paper, we propose a workflow for full body person anonymization utilizing Stable Diffusion as a generative backend. Text-to-image diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion, OpenAI's DALL-E or Midjourney, have become very popular in recent time, being able to create photorealistic images from a single text prompt. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the art anonymization pipelines with respect to image quality, resolution, Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Additionally, our method is invariant with respect to the image generator and thus able to be used with the latest models available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Medical Vision-Language Pre-training Succeed with Purely Synthetic Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13523v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (MedVLP) has made significant progress in enabling zero-shot tasks for medical image understanding. However, training MedVLP models typically requires large-scale datasets with paired, high-quality image-text data, which are scarce in the medical domain. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models have made it possible to generate large-scale synthetic image-text pairs. This raises the question: *Can MedVLP succeed using purely synthetic data?* To address this, we use off-the-shelf generative models to create synthetic radiology reports and paired Chest X-ray (CXR) images, and propose an automated pipeline to build a diverse, high-quality synthetic dataset, enabling a rigorous study that isolates model and training settings, focusing entirely from the data perspective. Our results show that MedVLP models trained *exclusively on synthetic data* outperform those trained on real data by **3.8%** in averaged AUC on zero-shot classification. Moreover, using a combination of synthetic and real data leads to a further improvement of **9.07%**. Additionally, MedVLP models trained on synthetic or mixed data consistently outperform those trained on real data in zero-shot grounding, as well as in fine-tuned classification and segmentation tasks. Our analysis suggests MedVLP trained on well-designed synthetic data can outperform models trained on real datasets, which may be limited by low-quality samples and long-tailed distributions.</p></details> | Under Review |

The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

| **[Solving Prior Distribution Mismatch in Diffusion Models via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13431v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the knowledge surrounding diffusion models(DMs) has grown significantly, though several theoretical gaps remain. Particularly noteworthy is prior error, defined as the discrepancy between the termination distribution of the forward process and the initial distribution of the reverse process. To address these deficiencies, this paper explores the deeper relationship between optimal transport(OT) theory and DMs with discrete initial distribution. Specifically, we demonstrate that the two stages of DMs fundamentally involve computing time-dependent OT. However, unavoidable prior error result in deviation during the reverse process under quadratic transport cost. By proving that as the diffusion termination time increases, the probability flow exponentially converges to the gradient of the solution to the classical Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we establish a vital link between these fields. Therefore, static OT emerges as the most intrinsic single-step method for bridging this theoretical potential gap. Additionally, we apply these insights to accelerate sampling in both unconditional and conditional generation scenarios. Experimental results across multiple image datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches can replicate a given concept by learning from reference images, yet they lack the flexibility for fine-grained customization of the individual component within the concept. In this paper, we introduce component-controllable personalization, a novel task that pushes the boundaries of T2I models by allowing users to reconfigure specific components when personalizing visual concepts. This task is particularly challenging due to two primary obstacles: semantic pollution, where unwanted visual elements corrupt the personalized concept, and semantic imbalance, which causes disproportionate learning of the concept and component. To overcome these challenges, we design MagicTailor, an innovative framework that leverages Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to dynamically perturb undesired visual semantics and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to establish a balanced learning paradigm for desired visual semantics. Extensive comparisons, ablations, and analyses demonstrate that MagicTailor not only excels in this challenging task but also holds significant promise for practical applications, paving the way for more nuanced and creative image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://correr-zhou.github.io/MagicTailor</p></details> |

Meanwhile, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved great success in probabilistic time series imputation tasks with its power to model complex distributions. However, current DDPM-based probabilistic time series imputation methodologies are confronted with two types of challenges: 1)~\textit{~The backbone modules of the denoising parts are not capable of achieving sequence modeling with low time complexity.} 2)~\textit{The architecture of denoising modules can not handle the inter-variable and bidirectional dependencies in the time series imputation problem effectively.} To address the first challenge, we integrate the computational efficient state space model, namely Mamba, as the backbone denosing module for DDPMs. To tackle the second challenge, we carefully devise several SSM-based blocks for bidirectional modeling and inter-variable relation understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art time series imputation results on multiple datasets, different missing scenarios and missing ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessary a Gibbs measure, where the Lagrange and KKT multipliers naturally arise from some constraints to ensure the learnt policy to be a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function under Tsallis entropy and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we need to consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two financial applications, namely, an optimal portfolio liquidation problem and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.</p></details> |  |

A critical concern regarding these models is their performance on out-of-distribution tasks, which remains an under-explored challenge. Using a diffusion model on an out-of-distribution dataset, realistic reconstructions can be generated, but with hallucinating image features that are uniquely present in the training dataset. To address this discrepancy during train-test time and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce a novel sampling framework called Steerable Conditional Diffusion. Specifically, this framework adapts the diffusion model, concurrently with image reconstruction, based solely on the information provided by the available measurement. Utilising our proposed method, we achieve substantial enhancements in out-of-distribution performance across diverse imaging modalities, advancing the robust deployment of denoising diffusion models in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba2, RWKV6, Gated Linear Attention, etc, and identify two key features--attention normalization and non-causal inference--that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion enables satisfactory and efficient zero-shot cross-resolution generation, accommodating ultra-resolution images like 16K on a single GPU. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components and pipelines, such as ControlNet, IP-Adapter, DemoFusion, DistriFusion, etc, requiring no adaptation efforts.

| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data by decomposing it into trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and higlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. We hope our work can bring a new perspective for time series forecasting. We intend to make our code publicly available as open-source in the future.</p></details> |  |

It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed S2S Diffusion. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks. In this paper, we propose the Meta-DiffuB framework - a novel scheduler-exploiter S2S-Diffusion paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of existing S2S-Diffusion models. We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-DiffuB achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets. We further investigate and visualize the impact of Meta-DiffuB's noise scheduling on the generation of sentences with varying difficulties. Additionally, our scheduler model can function as a "plug-and-play" model to enhance DiffuSeq without the need for fine-tuning during the inference stage.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, a number of works~\cite{chen2023sampling,chen2023ode,benton2023error,lee2022convergence} have proposed schemes for diffusion sampling with provable guarantees; these works show that for essentially any data distribution, one can approximately sample in polynomial time given a sufficiently accurate estimate of its score functions at different noise levels. In this work, we propose a new scheme inspired by Shen and Lee's randomized midpoint method for log-concave sampling~\cite{ShenL19}. We prove that this approach achieves the best known dimension dependence for sampling from arbitrary smooth distributions in total variation distance ($\widetilde O(d^{5/12})$ compared to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d})$ from prior work). We also show that our algorithm can be parallelized to run in only $\widetilde O(\log^2 d)$ parallel rounds, constituting the first provable guarantees for parallel sampling with diffusion models. As a byproduct of our methods, for the well-studied problem of log-concave sampling in total variation distance, we give an algorithm and simple analysis achieving dimension dependence $\widetilde O(d^{5/12})$ compared to $\widetilde O(\sqrt{d})$ from prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCP-Diffusion: A Multi-modal Diffusion Model for Global Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Forecasting with Change Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13175v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precipitation from tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause disasters such as flooding, mudslides, and landslides. Predicting such precipitation in advance is crucial, giving people time to prepare and defend against these precipitation-induced disasters. Developing deep learning (DL) rainfall prediction methods offers a new way to predict potential disasters. However, one problem is that most existing methods suffer from cumulative errors and lack physical consistency. Second, these methods overlook the importance of meteorological factors in TC rainfall and their integration with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Therefore, we propose Tropical Cyclone Precipitation Diffusion (TCP-Diffusion), a multi-modal model for global tropical cyclone precipitation forecasting. It forecasts TC rainfall around the TC center for the next 12 hours at 3 hourly resolution based on past rainfall observations and multi-modal environmental variables. Adjacent residual prediction (ARP) changes the training target from the absolute rainfall value to the rainfall trend and gives our model the ability of rainfall change awareness, reducing cumulative errors and ensuring physical consistency. Considering the influence of TC-related meteorological factors and the useful information from NWP model forecasts, we propose a multi-model framework with specialized encoders to extract richer information from environmental variables and results provided by NWP models. The results of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other DL methods and the NWP method from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Capabilities of Masked Generative Models for Image Synthesis via Self-Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13136v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked generative models (MGMs) have shown impressive generative ability while providing an order of magnitude efficient sampling steps compared to continuous diffusion models. However, MGMs still underperform in image synthesis compared to recent well-developed continuous diffusion models with similar size in terms of quality and diversity of generated samples. A key factor in the performance of continuous diffusion models stems from the guidance methods, which enhance the sample quality at the expense of diversity. In this paper, we extend these guidance methods to generalized guidance formulation for MGMs and propose a self-guidance sampling method, which leads to better generation quality. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary task for semantic smoothing in vector-quantized token space, analogous to the Gaussian blur in continuous pixel space. Equipped with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method and high-temperature sampling, MGMs with the proposed self-guidance achieve a superior quality-diversity trade-off, outperforming existing sampling methods in MGMs with more efficient training and sampling costs. Extensive experiments with the various sampling hyperparameters confirm the effectiveness of the proposed self-guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

Previous works have explored extending controllability in two directions: instruction tuning with text-based prompts and multi-modal conditioning. However, these works make one or more unnatural assumptions on the number and/or type of modality inputs used to express controllability. We propose InstructAny2Pix, a flexible multi-modal instruction-following system that enables users to edit an input image using instructions involving audio, images, and text. InstructAny2Pix consists of three building blocks that facilitate this capability: a multi-modal encoder that encodes different modalities such as images and audio into a unified latent space, a diffusion model that learns to decode representations in this latent space into images, and a multi-modal LLM that can understand instructions involving multiple images and audio pieces and generate a conditional embedding of the desired output, which can be used by the diffusion decoder. Additionally, to facilitate training efficiency and improve generation quality, we include an additional refinement prior module that enhances the visual quality of LLM outputs. These designs are critical to the performance of our system. We demonstrate that our system can perform a series of novel instruction-guided editing tasks.

Our method leverages the text-to-image generation capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model by manipulating token embeddings corresponding to the specified class in its latent space. These token embeddings guide the generation of adversarial images that maintain high visual fidelity. The SD-MIAE framework consists of two phases: (1) an initial adversarial optimization phase that modifies token embeddings to produce misclassified yet natural-looking images and (2) a momentum-based optimization phase that refines the adversarial perturbations. By introducing momentum, our approach stabilizes the optimization of perturbations across iterations, enhancing both the misclassification rate and visual fidelity of the generated adversarial examples. Experimental results demonstrate that SD-MIAE achieves a high misclassification rate of 79%, improving by 35% over the state-of-the-art method while preserving the imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations and the semantic similarity to the original class label, making it a practical method for robust adversarial evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Preference Diffusion for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13117v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems predict personalized item rankings based on user preference distributions derived from historical behavior data. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained attention in recommendation for their ability to model complex distributions, yet current DM-based recommenders often rely on traditional objectives like mean squared error (MSE) or recommendation objectives, which are not optimized for personalized ranking tasks or fail to fully leverage DM's generative potential. To address this, we propose PreferDiff, a tailored optimization objective for DM-based recommenders. PreferDiff transforms BPR into a log-likelihood ranking objective and integrates multiple negative samples to better capture user preferences. Specifically, we employ variational inference to handle the intractability through minimizing the variational upper bound and replaces MSE with cosine error to improve alignment with recommendation tasks. Finally, we balance learning generation and preference to enhance the training stability of DMs. PreferDiff offers three key benefits: it is the first personalized ranking loss designed specifically for DM-based recommenders and it improves ranking and faster convergence by addressing hard negatives. We also prove that it is theoretically connected to Direct Preference Optimization which indicates that it has the potential to align user preferences in DM-based recommenders via generative modeling. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate its superior recommendation performance and commendable general sequential recommendation capabilities.

However, the process of personalization presents inherent challenges in terms of time and memory requirements. Fine-tuning each personalized model needs considerable GPU time investment, and storing a personalized model per subject can be demanding in terms of storage capacity. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyperDreamBooth - a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles, with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications. Our method achieves personalization on faces in roughly 20 seconds, 25x faster than DreamBooth and 125x faster than Textual Inversion, using as few as one reference image, with the same quality and style diversity as DreamBooth. Also our method yields a model that is 10,000x smaller than a normal DreamBooth model.

Existing approaches, typically based on diffusion models, often generate unnatural and unrealistic results. In this work, we introduce InterMask, a novel framework for generating human interactions using collaborative masked modeling in discrete space. InterMask first employs a VQ-VAE to transform each motion sequence into a 2D discrete motion token map. Unlike traditional 1D VQ token maps, it better preserves fine-grained spatio-temporal details and promotes spatial awareness within each token. Building on this representation, InterMask utilizes a generative masked modeling framework to collaboratively model the tokens of two interacting individuals. This is achieved by employing a transformer architecture specifically designed to capture complex spatio-temporal interdependencies. During training, it randomly masks the motion tokens of both individuals and learns to predict them. In inference, starting from fully masked sequences, it progressively fills in the tokens for both individuals. With its enhanced motion representation, dedicated architecture, and effective learning strategy, InterMask achieves state-of-the-art results, producing high-fidelity and diverse human interactions. It outperforms previous methods, achieving an FID of $5.154$ (vs $5.535$ for in2IN) on the InterHuman dataset and $0.399$ (vs $5.207$ for InterGen) on the InterX dataset. Additionally, InterMask seamlessly supports reaction generation without the need for model redesign or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://gohar-malik.github.io/intermask</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Trajectory Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13027v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise in generating 3D geometric systems, which is a fundamental problem in many natural science domains such as molecule and protein design. However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024. 29 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

However, these methods do not work well in real-world low-light conditions as the images captured in such conditions lose most important information and contain significant unknown noises. To solve this problem, we propose a SRRIIE dataset with an efficient conditional diffusion probabilistic models-based method. The proposed dataset contains 4800 paired low-high quality images. To ensure that the dataset are able to model the real-world image degradation in low-illumination environments, we capture images using an ILDC camera and an optical zoom lens with exposure levels ranging from -6 EV to 0 EV and ISO levels ranging from 50 to 12800. We comprehensively evaluate with various reconstruction and perceptual metrics and demonstrate the practicabilities of the SRRIIE dataset for deep learning-based methods. We show that most existing methods are less effective in preserving the structures and sharpness of restored images from complicated noises. To overcome this problem, we revise the condition for Raw sensor data and propose a novel time-melding condition for diffusion probabilistic model. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectivenesses of the proposed conditional diffusion probabilistic model on Raw sensor data.

This scarcity leads to overfitting, where models perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data. This paper proposes a Syn2Real (Synthetic to Real) domain generalization approach using diffusion models to address this challenge. We demonstrate that synthetic data generated with noise by DDPM and DDIM models, even if not perfectly realistic, can effectively augment real-world samples for training. The residual noise in the final sampled images improves the model's ability to generalize to real-world data with inherent noise and high variation. The baseline Mask-RCNN model when trained on a combination of synthetic and original training datasets, exhibited approximately a 60% increase in Average Precision (AP) compared to being trained solely on the original training data. This significant improvement highlights the potential of Syn2Real domain generalization for underwater mine detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing the unique challenges posed by the spatiotemporal nature of video, our method introduces Motion Embeddings, a set of explicit, temporally coherent embeddings derived from a given video. These embeddings are designed to integrate seamlessly with the temporal transformer modules of video diffusion models, modulating self-attention computations across frames without compromising spatial integrity. Our approach provides a compact and efficient solution to motion representation, utilizing two types of embeddings: a Motion Query-Key Embedding to modulate the temporal attention map and a Motion Value Embedding to modulate the attention values. Additionally, we introduce an inference strategy that excludes spatial dimensions from the Motion Query-Key Embedding and applies a differential operation to the Motion Value Embedding, both designed to debias appearance and ensure the embeddings focus solely on motion. Our contributions include the introduction of a tailored motion embedding for customization tasks and a demonstration of the practical advantages and effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://wileewang.github.io/MotionInversion/</p></details> |

However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies.

Existing unlearning/editing-based methods for safe generation remove harmful concepts from models but face several challenges: (1) They cannot instantly remove harmful concepts without training. (2) Their safe generation capabilities depend on collected training data. (3) They alter model weights, risking degradation in quality for content unrelated to toxic concepts. To address these, we propose SAFREE, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I and T2V, that does not alter the model's weights. Specifically, we detect a subspace corresponding to a set of toxic concepts in the text embedding space and steer prompt embeddings away from this subspace, thereby filtering out harmful content while preserving intended semantics. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving safe concepts, SAFREE incorporates a novel self-validating filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the denoising steps when applying the filtered embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate adaptive re-attention mechanisms within the diffusion latent space to selectively diminish the influence of features related to toxic concepts at the pixel level. In the end, SAFREE ensures coherent safety checking, preserving the fidelity, quality, and safety of the output. SAFREE achieves SOTA performance in suppressing unsafe content in T2I generation compared to training-free baselines and effectively filters targeted concepts while maintaining high-quality images. It also shows competitive results against training-based methods. We extend SAFREE to various T2I backbones and T2V tasks, showcasing its flexibility and generalization. SAFREE provides a robust and adaptable safeguard for ensuring safe visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; Project page: https://safree-safe-t2i-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |

Despite extensive research on Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of Text-to-Image (T2I) model alignment remains largely unexplored. Addressing this problem, we propose LiVO (Lightweight Value Optimization), a novel lightweight method for aligning T2I models with human values. LiVO only optimizes a plug-and-play value encoder to integrate a specified value principle with the input prompt, allowing the control of generated images over both semantics and values. Specifically, we design a diffusion model-tailored preference optimization loss, which theoretically approximates the Bradley-Terry model used in LLM alignment but provides a more flexible trade-off between image quality and value conformity. To optimize the value encoder, we also develop a framework to automatically construct a text-image preference dataset of 86k (prompt, aligned image, violating image, value principle) samples. Without updating most model parameters and through adaptive value selection from the input prompt, LiVO significantly reduces harmful outputs and achieves faster convergence, surpassing several strong baselines and taking an initial step towards ethically aligned T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024.

However, these methods often make insufficient use of semantic information, leading to less desirable results. In this paper, we proposed a novel mask-free point-based image editing method, AdaptiveDrag, which provides a more flexible editing approach and generates images that better align with user intent. Specifically, we design an auto mask generation module using super-pixel division for user-friendliness. Next, we leverage a pre-trained diffusion model to optimize the latent, enabling the dragging of features from handle points to target points. To ensure a comprehensive connection between the input image and the drag process, we have developed a semantic-driven optimization. We design adaptive steps that are supervised by the positions of the points and the semantic regions derived from super-pixel segmentation. This refined optimization process also leads to more realistic and accurate drag results. Furthermore, to address the limitations in the generative consistency of the diffusion model, we introduce an innovative corresponding loss during the sampling process. Building on these effective designs, our method delivers superior generation results using only the single input image and the handle-target point pairs. Extensive experiments have been conducted and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms others in handling various drag instructions (e.g., resize, movement, extension) across different domains (e.g., animals, human face, land space, clothing).</p></details> |  |
| **[One Step Diffusion via Shortcut Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12557v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models and flow-matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce shortcut models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time.</p></details> |  |

The remarkable success of these recent efforts on diffusion models comes largely from progressive design principles and efficient architecture, training, inference, and deployment methodologies. However, there has not been a comprehensive and in-depth review to summarize these principles and practices to help the rapid understanding and application of diffusion models.

Yet the wide applicability of FL is hindered by entanglement of data distributions across different clients. This paper demonstrates for the first time that by disentangling data distributions FL can in principle achieve efficiencies comparable to those of distributed systems, requiring only one round of communication. To this end, we propose a novel FedDistr algorithm, which employs stable diffusion models to decouple and recover data distributions. Empirical results on the CIFAR100 and DomainNet datasets show that FedDistr significantly enhances model utility and efficiency in both disentangled and near-disentangled scenarios while ensuring privacy, outperforming traditional federated learning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches are constrained by the limited word embeddings provided in pre-training, which hinders nuanced editing targeting open concepts with specific attributes. Directly altering the keywords in target prompts often results in unintended disruptions to the attention mechanisms. To achieve more flexible editing easily, this work proposes an improved concept-augmented video editing approach that generates diverse and stable target videos flexibly by devising abstract conceptual pairs. Specifically, the framework involves concept-augmented textual inversion and a dual prior supervision mechanism. The former enables plug-and-play guidance of stable diffusion for video editing, effectively capturing target attributes for more stylized results. The dual prior supervision mechanism significantly enhances video stability and fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach generates more stable and lifelike videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

Given a set of text prompts, we aim to generate a collection of objects with semantically corresponding parts aligned across them. Recent methods based on Score Distillation have succeeded in distilling the knowledge from 2D diffusion models to high-quality representations of the 3D objects. These methods handle multiple text queries separately, and therefore the resulting objects have a high variability in object pose and structure. However, in some applications, such as 3D asset design, it may be desirable to obtain a set of objects aligned with each other. In order to achieve the alignment of the corresponding parts of the generated objects, we propose to embed these objects into a common latent space and optimize the continuous transitions between these objects. We enforce two kinds of properties of these transitions: smoothness of the transition and plausibility of the intermediate objects along the transition. We demonstrate that both of these properties are essential for good alignment. We provide several practical scenarios that benefit from alignment between the objects, including 3D editing and object hybridization, and experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. https://voyleg.github.io/a3d/</p></details> |  |

To this end, we study the task of predicting the prompt embedding given an image generated by a generative diffusion model. We consider a series of white-box and black-box models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned). We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. In addition, we make an interesting discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts, when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.

| **[Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05898v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. To this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation on why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Let's Find Out!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17137v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models excel at mimicking real scenes, suggesting they might inherently encode important intrinsic scene properties. In this paper, we aim to explore the following key questions: (1) What intrinsic knowledge do generative models like GANs, Autoregressive models, and Diffusion models encode? (2) Can we establish a general framework to recover intrinsic representations from these models, regardless of their architecture or model type? (3) How minimal can the required learnable parameters and labeled data be to successfully recover this knowledge? (4) Is there a direct link between the quality of a generative model and the accuracy of the recovered scene intrinsics? Our findings indicate that a small Low-Rank Adaptators (LoRA) can recover intrinsic images-depth, normals, albedo and shading-across different generators (Autoregressive, GANs and Diffusion) while using the same decoder head that generates the image. As LoRA is lightweight, we introduce very few learnable parameters (as few as 0.04% of Stable Diffusion model weights for a rank of 2), and we find that as few as 250 labeled images are enough to generate intrinsic images with these LoRA modules. Finally, we also show a positive correlation between the generative model's quality and the accuracy of the recovered intrinsics through control experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://intrinsic-lora.github.io/</p></details> |

However, the one-step adaptation paradigm is inadequate in addressing the prevalent difficulties posed by low-resolution (LR) objects when viewed from the UAVs at night, owing to the blurry edge contour and limited detail information. Moreover, these approaches struggle to perceive LR objects disturbed by nighttime noise. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel progressive alignment paradigm, named domain-aware diffusion model (DaDiff), aligning nighttime LR object features to the daytime by virtue of progressive and stable generations. The proposed DaDiff includes an alignment encoder to enhance the detail information of nighttime LR objects, a tracking-oriented layer designed to achieve close collaboration with tracking tasks, and a successive distribution discriminator presented to distinguish different feature distributions at each diffusion timestep successively. Furthermore, an elaborate nighttime UAV tracking benchmark is constructed for LR objects, namely NUT-LR, consisting of 100 annotated sequences. Exhaustive experiments have demonstrated the robustness and feature alignment ability of the proposed DaDiff.

While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment. Furthermore, to address the amplified accumulation error caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG), we propose Anchored Optimization, which refines the guidance scale by anchoring it to a reference trajectory. Experimental results on text-to-audio generation demonstrate that FlashAudio's one-step generation performance surpasses the diffusion-based models with hundreds of sampling steps on audio quality and enables a sampling speed of 400x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU.</p></details> |  |

It reduces the necessary generation time of similarly sized video diffusion models from 25 seconds to around 1 second while maintaining the same level of performance. The method's effectiveness lies in its dual-level decoupling learning approach: 1) separating the learning of video style from video generation acceleration, which allows for personalized style video generation without any personalized style video data, and 2) separating the acceleration of image generation from the acceleration of video motion generation, enhancing training efficiency and mitigating the negative effects of low-quality video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Short Paper by SIGGRAPH ASIA 2024 Technical Communications.

We introduce a framework, SetItUp, for learning to interpret under-specified instructions. SetItUp takes a small number of training examples and a human-crafted program sketch to uncover arrangement rules for specific scene types. By leveraging an intermediate graph-like representation of abstract spatial relationships among objects, SetItUp decomposes the arrangement problem into two subproblems: i) learning the arrangement patterns from limited data and ii) grounding these abstract relationships into object poses. SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose the abstract spatial relationships among objects in novel scenes as the constraints to be satisfied; then, it composes a library of diffusion models associated with these abstract relationships to find object poses that satisfy the constraints. We validate our framework on a dataset comprising study desks, dining tables, and coffee tables, with the results showing superior performance in generating physically plausible, functional, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements compared to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main paper, 21 pages appendix, RSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Sample what you cant compress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02529v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the efficacy of jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207v6)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[MEDIC: Zero-shot Music Editing with Disentangled Inversion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13220v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided diffusion models make a paradigm shift in audio generation, facilitating the adaptability of source audio to conform to specific textual prompts. Recent works introduce inversion techniques, like DDIM inversion, to zero-shot editing, exploiting pretrained diffusion models for audio modification. Nonetheless, our investigation exposes that DDIM inversion suffers from an accumulation of errors across each diffusion step, undermining its efficacy. Moreover, existing editing methods fail to achieve effective complex non-rigid music editing while maintaining essential content preservation and high editing fidelity. To counteract these issues, we introduce the Disentangled Inversion technique to disentangle the diffusion process into triple branches, rectifying the deviated path of the source branch caused by DDIM inversion. In addition, we propose the Harmonized Attention Control framework, which unifies the mutual self-attention control and cross-attention control with an intermediate Harmonic Branch to progressively achieve the desired harmonic and melodic information in the target music. Collectively, these innovations comprise the Disentangled Inversion Control (DIC) framework, enabling accurate music editing while safeguarding content integrity. To benchmark audio editing efficacy, we introduce ZoME-Bench, a comprehensive music editing benchmark hosting 1,100 samples spread across ten distinct editing categories. This facilitates both zero-shot and instruction-based music editing tasks. Our method achieves unparalleled performance in edit fidelity and essential content preservation, outperforming contemporary state-of-the-art inversion techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference Optimization with Multi-Sample Comparisons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12138v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have been driven by extensive pretraining on large datasets followed by post-training. However, current post-training methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct alignment from preference methods (DAP) primarily utilize single-sample comparisons. These approaches often fail to capture critical characteristics such as generative diversity and bias, which are more accurately assessed through multiple samples. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that extends post-training to include multi-sample comparisons. To achieve this, we propose Multi-sample Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) and Multi-sample Identity Preference Optimization (mIPO). These methods improve traditional DAP methods by focusing on group-wise characteristics. Empirically, we demonstrate that multi-sample comparison is more effective in optimizing collective characteristics~(e.g., diversity and bias) for generative models than single-sample comparison. Additionally, our findings suggest that multi-sample comparisons provide a more robust optimization framework, particularly for dataset with label noise.</p></details> | preprint |

Creating synthetic, attribute-rich graphs that mirror real-world examples is crucial, especially for sharing graph data for analysis and developing learning models when original data is restricted to be shared. Traditional graph generation methods are limited in their capacity to handle these complex structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown potential in generating graph structures without attributes and smaller molecular graphs. However, these models face challenges in generating large attributed graphs due to the complex attribute-structure correlations and the large size of these graphs. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model, GraphMaker, specifically designed for generating large attributed graphs. We explore various combinations of node attribute and graph structure generation processes, finding that an asynchronous approach more effectively captures the intricate attribute-structure correlations. We also address scalability issues through edge mini-batching generation. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach in graph data dissemination, we introduce a new evaluation pipeline. The evaluation demonstrates that synthetic graphs generated by GraphMaker can be used to develop competitive graph machine learning models for the tasks defined over the original graphs without actually accessing these graphs, while many leading graph generation methods fall short in this evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR, Code available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/GraphMaker</p></details> |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

As opposed to traditional one-step dynamics models, DWM offers long-horizon predictions in a single forward pass, eliminating the need for recursive queries. We integrate DWM into model-based value estimation, where the short-term return is simulated by future trajectories sampled from DWM. In the context of offline reinforcement learning, DWM can be viewed as a conservative value regularization through generative modeling. Alternatively, it can be seen as a data source that enables offline Q-learning with synthetic data. Our experiments on the D4RL dataset confirm the robustness of DWM to long-horizon simulation. In terms of absolute performance, DWM significantly surpasses one-step dynamics models with a $44\%$ performance gain, and is comparable to or slightly surpassing their model-free counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Guidance for Diffusion Models: An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14743v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper studies a form of gradient guidance for adapting a pre-trained diffusion model towards optimizing user-specified objectives. We establish a mathematical framework for guided diffusion to systematically study its optimization theory and algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis spots a strong link between guided diffusion models and optimization: gradient-guided diffusion models are essentially sampling solutions to a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization is imposed by the pre-training data. As for guidance design, directly bringing in the gradient of an external objective function as guidance would jeopardize the structure in generated samples. We investigate a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the information in pre-trained score functions and provably preserves the latent structure. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where guidance and score network are both updated with newly generated samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved O(1/K) convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yukang123/GGDMOptim.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06190v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM.

| **[DDIL: Improved Diffusion Distillation With Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11971v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at generative modeling (e.g., text-to-image) but sampling requires multiple denoising network passes, limiting practicality. Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</p></details> |  |

Previous works have shown promising results in augmenting datasets by generating synthetic samples. However, they only support domain-specific ad hoc use cases (e.g., either image or text only, but not both), and are limited in data diversity due to a lack of fine-grained control over the synthesis process. In this paper, we design a \emph{controllable} image-text synthesis pipeline, CtrlSynth, for data-efficient and robust multimodal learning. The key idea is to decompose the visual semantics of an image into basic elements, apply user-specified control policies (e.g., remove, add, or replace operations), and recompose them to synthesize images or texts. The decompose and recompose feature in CtrlSynth allows users to control data synthesis in a fine-grained manner by defining customized control policies to manipulate the basic elements. CtrlSynth leverages the capabilities of pretrained foundation models such as large language models or diffusion models to reason and recompose basic elements such that synthetic samples are natural and composed in diverse ways. CtrlSynth is a closed-loop, training-free, and modular framework, making it easy to support different pretrained models. With extensive experiments on 31 datasets spanning different vision and vision-language tasks, we show that CtrlSynth substantially improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and compositional reasoning performance of CLIP models.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11838v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for frame interpolation, HiFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low- to high-resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. We show that this technique drastically reduces memory usage at inference time and also allows us to use a single model at test time, solving both frame interpolation and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost. We show that HiFI helps significantly with high resolution and complex repeated textures that require global context. HiFI demonstrates comparable or beyond state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, SEPE-8K). On our newly introduced dataset that focuses on particularly challenging cases, HiFI also significantly outperforms other baselines on these cases.

| **[On the Effectiveness of Dataset Alignment for Fake Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11835v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As latent diffusion models (LDMs) democratize image generation capabilities, there is a growing need to detect fake images. A good detector should focus on the generative models fingerprints while ignoring image properties such as semantic content, resolution, file format, etc. Fake image detectors are usually built in a data driven way, where a model is trained to separate real from fake images. Existing works primarily investigate network architecture choices and training recipes. In this work, we argue that in addition to these algorithmic choices, we also require a well aligned dataset of real/fake images to train a robust detector. For the family of LDMs, we propose a very simple way to achieve this: we reconstruct all the real images using the LDMs autoencoder, without any denoising operation. We then train a model to separate these real images from their reconstructions. The fakes created this way are extremely similar to the real ones in almost every aspect (e.g., size, aspect ratio, semantic content), which forces the model to look for the LDM decoders artifacts. We empirically show that this way of creating aligned real/fake datasets, which also sidesteps the computationally expensive denoising process, helps in building a detector that focuses less on spurious correlations, something that a very popular existing method is susceptible to. Finally, to demonstrate just how effective the alignment in a dataset can be, we build a detector using images that are not natural objects, and present promising results. Overall, our work identifies the subtle but significant issues that arise when training a fake image detector and proposes a simple and inexpensive solution to address these problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Experimental Design via Contrastive Diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11826v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a powerful tool to reduce the cost of running a sequence of experiments. When based on the Expected Information Gain (EIG), design optimization corresponds to the maximization of some intractable expected {\it contrast} between prior and posterior distributions. Scaling this maximization to high dimensional and complex settings has been an issue due to BOED inherent computational complexity. In this work, we introduce an {\it expected posterior} distribution with cost-effective sampling properties and provide a tractable access to the EIG contrast maximization via a new EIG gradient expression. Diffusion-based samplers are used to compute the dynamics of the expected posterior and ideas from bi-level optimization are leveraged to derive an efficient joint sampling-optimization loop, without resorting to lower bound approximations of the EIG. The resulting efficiency gain allows to extend BOED to the well-tested generative capabilities of diffusion models. By incorporating generative models into the BOED framework, we expand its scope and its use in scenarios that were previously impractical. Numerical experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods show the potential of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Long-Text Alignment for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11817v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose LongAlign, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512 \times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.

It can serve as a natural interface for image editing, dramatically improving precision and flexibility. Leveraging this benefit, we introduce a new framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with Text2Image generative model for scene graph-based image editing. This integration enables precise modifications at the object level and creative recomposition of scenes without compromising overall image integrity. Our approach involves two primary stages: 1) Utilizing a LLM-driven scene parser, we construct an image's scene graph, capturing key objects and their interrelationships, as well as parsing fine-grained attributes such as object masks and descriptions. These annotations facilitate concept learning with a fine-tuned diffusion model, representing each object with an optimized token and detailed description prompt. 2) During the image editing phase, a LLM editing controller guides the edits towards specific areas. These edits are then implemented by an attention-modulated diffusion editor, utilizing the fine-tuned model to perform object additions, deletions, replacements, and adjustments.

| **[ImageFolder: Autoregressive Image Generation with Folded Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01756v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenizers are crucial for visual generative models, e.g., diffusion models (DMs) and autoregressive (AR) models, as they construct the latent representation for modeling. Increasing token length is a common approach to improve the image reconstruction quality. However, tokenizers with longer token lengths are not guaranteed to achieve better generation quality. There exists a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality regarding token length. In this paper, we investigate the impact of token length on both image reconstruction and generation and provide a flexible solution to the tradeoff. We propose ImageFolder, a semantic tokenizer that provides spatially aligned image tokens that can be folded during autoregressive modeling to improve both generation efficiency and quality. To enhance the representative capability without increasing token length, we leverage dual-branch product quantization to capture different contexts of images. Specifically, semantic regularization is introduced in one branch to encourage compacted semantic information while another branch is designed to capture the remaining pixel-level details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of image generation and shorter token length with ImageFolder tokenizer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/lxa9867/ImageFolder</p></details> |
| **[Patch-Based Diffusion Models Beat Whole-Image Models for Mismatched Distribution Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11730v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved excellent success in solving inverse problems due to their ability to learn strong image priors, but existing approaches require a large training dataset of images that should come from the same distribution as the test dataset. When the training and test distributions are mismatched, artifacts and hallucinations can occur in reconstructed images due to the incorrect priors. In this work, we systematically study out of distribution (OOD) problems where a known training distribution is first provided. We first study the setting where only a single measurement obtained from the unknown test distribution is available. Next we study the setting where a very small sample of data belonging to the test distribution is available, and our goal is still to reconstruct an image from a measurement that came from the test distribution. In both settings, we use a patch-based diffusion prior that learns the image distribution solely from patches. Furthermore, in the first setting, we include a self-supervised loss that helps the network output maintain consistency with the measurement. Extensive experiments show that in both settings, the patch-based method can obtain high quality image reconstructions that can outperform whole-image models and can compete with methods that have access to large in-distribution training datasets. Furthermore, we show how whole-image models are prone to memorization and overfitting, leading to artifacts in the reconstructions, while a patch-based model can resolve these issues.</p></details> |  |

However, a drawback of this approach is the need to learn a denoising function, which is significantly more complex than learning an explicit policy. In this work, we propose Equivariant Diffusion Policy, a novel diffusion policy learning method that leverages domain symmetries to obtain better sample efficiency and generalization in the denoising function. We theoretically analyze the $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry of full 6-DoF control and characterize when a diffusion model is $\mathrm{SO}(2)$-equivariant. We furthermore evaluate the method empirically on a set of 12 simulation tasks in MimicGen, and show that it obtains a success rate that is, on average, 21.9% higher than the baseline Diffusion Policy. We also evaluate the method on a real-world system to show that effective policies can be learned with relatively few training samples, whereas the baseline Diffusion Policy cannot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning 2024, Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Existing methods for spatial-temporal control in text-conditioned motion generation suffer from significant runtime inefficiency. To address this issue, we first propose the motion latent consistency model (MotionLCM) for motion generation, building upon the latent diffusion model. By adopting one-step (or few-step) inference, we further improve the runtime efficiency of the motion latent diffusion model for motion generation. To ensure effective controllability, we incorporate a motion ControlNet within the latent space of MotionLCM and enable explicit control signals (e.g., initial poses) in the vanilla motion space to control the generation process directly, similar to controlling other latent-free diffusion models for motion generation. By employing these techniques, our approach can generate human motions with text and control signals in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable generation and controlling capabilities of MotionLCM while maintaining real-time runtime efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Motio...</summary><p>MotionLCM project version 1.0 (ECCV 2024)</p></details> |

However, it still faces challenges when dealing with complex long-horizon deformable object tasks, such as high-dimensional state spaces, complex dynamics, and multimodal action distributions. Traditional imitation learning methods often require a large amount of data and encounter distributional shifts and accumulative errors in these tasks. To address these issues, we propose a data-efficient general learning framework (DeformPAM) based on preference learning and reward-guided action selection. DeformPAM decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple action primitives, utilizes 3D point cloud inputs and diffusion models to model action distributions, and trains an implicit reward model using human preference data. During the inference phase, the reward model scores multiple candidate actions, selecting the optimal action for execution, thereby reducing the occurrence of anomalous actions and improving task completion quality. Experiments conducted on three challenging real-world long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Results show that DeformPAM improves both task completion quality and efficiency compared to baseline methods even with limited data. Code and data will be available at https://deform-pam.robotflow.ai.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

| **[InvSeg: Test-Time Prompt Inversion for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11473v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-textual correlations in the attention maps derived from text-to-image diffusion models are proven beneficial to dense visual prediction tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation. However, a significant challenge arises due to the input distributional discrepancy between the context-rich sentences used for image generation and the isolated class names typically employed in semantic segmentation, hindering the diffusion models from capturing accurate visual-textual correlations. To solve this, we propose InvSeg, a test-time prompt inversion method that tackles open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by inverting image-specific visual context into text prompt embedding space, leveraging structure information derived from the diffusion model's reconstruction process to enrich text prompts so as to associate each class with a structure-consistent mask. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive Soft Clustering (CSC) to align derived masks with the image's structure information, softly selecting anchors for each class and calculating weighted distances to push inner-class pixels closer while separating inter-class pixels, thereby ensuring mask distinction and internal consistency. By incorporating sample-specific context, InvSeg learns context-rich text prompts in embedding space and achieves accurate semantic alignment across modalities. Experiments show that InvSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC and Context datasets. Project page: https://jylin8100.github.io/InvSegProject/.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Approach to Unifying Diffusion-based Conditional Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11439v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in image generation has sparked research into controlling these models through condition signals, with various methods addressing specific challenges in conditional generation. Instead of proposing another specialized technique, we introduce a simple, unified framework to handle diverse conditional generation tasks involving a specific image-condition correlation. By learning a joint distribution over a correlated image pair (e.g. image and depth) with a diffusion model, our approach enables versatile capabilities via different inference-time sampling schemes, including controllable image generation (e.g. depth to image), estimation (e.g. image to depth), signal guidance, joint generation (image & depth), and coarse control. Previous attempts at unification often introduce significant complexity through multi-stage training, architectural modification, or increased parameter counts. In contrast, our simple formulation requires a single, computationally efficient training stage, maintains the standard model input, and adds minimal learned parameters (15% of the base model). Moreover, our model supports additional capabilities like non-spatially aligned and coarse conditioning. Extensive results show that our single model can produce comparable results with specialized methods and better results than prior unified methods. We also demonstrate that multiple models can be effectively combined for multi-signal conditional generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lixirui142.github.io/unicon-diffusion/</p></details> |

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiupinjia.github.io/metaearth/</p></details> |
| **[Faster Diffusion: Rethinking the Role of the Encoder for Diffusion Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09608v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main drawback of diffusion models is the slow inference time for image generation. Among the most successful approaches to addressing this problem are distillation methods. However, these methods require considerable computational resources. In this paper, we take another approach to diffusion model acceleration. We conduct a comprehensive study of the UNet encoder and empirically analyze the encoder features. This provides insights regarding their changes during the inference process. In particular, we find that encoder features change minimally, whereas the decoder features exhibit substantial variations across different time-steps. This insight motivates us to omit encoder computation at certain adjacent time-steps and reuse encoder features of previous time-steps as input to the decoder in multiple time-steps. Importantly, this allows us to perform decoder computation in parallel, further accelerating the denoising process. Additionally, we introduce a prior noise injection method to improve the texture details in the generated image. Besides the standard text-to-image task, we also validate our approach on other tasks: text-to-video, personalized generation and reference-guided generation. Without utilizing any knowledge distillation technique, our approach accelerates both the Stable Diffusion (SD) and DeepFloyd-IF model sampling by 41$\%$ and 24$\%$ respectively, and DiT model sampling by 34$\%$, while maintaining high-quality generation performance.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

DIAR introduces an Adaptive Revaluation mechanism that dynamically adjusts decision lengths by comparing current and future state values, enabling flexible long-term decision-making. Furthermore, we address Q-value overestimation by combining Q-network learning with a value function guided by a diffusion model. The diffusion model generates diverse latent trajectories, enhancing policy robustness and generalization.

We introduce a novel generative learning methodology utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model in latent space as the framework for theoretical exploration in this domain. Our approach commences with the pre-training of an encoder-decoder architecture using data originating from a distribution that may diverge from the target distribution, thus facilitating the accommodation of a large sample size through the utilization of pre-existing large-scale models. Subsequently, we develop a diffusion model within the latent space utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge framework. Our theoretical analysis encompasses the establishment of end-to-end error analysis for learning distributions via the latent Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model. Specifically, we control the second-order Wasserstein distance between the generated distribution and the target distribution. Furthermore, our obtained convergence rates effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality, offering robust theoretical support for prevailing diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Retrofitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11330v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AfterLearnER (After Learning Evolutionary Retrofitting) consists in applying non-differentiable optimization, including evolutionary methods, to refine fully-trained machine learning models by optimizing a set of carefully chosen parameters or hyperparameters of the model, with respect to some actual, exact, and hence possibly non-differentiable error signal, performed on a subset of the standard validation set. The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by tackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth sensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, image quality in 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), image generation via Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or BLEU in code translation, and human appreciations in image synthesis. In some cases, this retrofitting is performed dynamically at inference time by taking into account user inputs. The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility (no gradient is needed), the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback including human evaluations, the limited overfitting, supported by a theoretical study and its anytime behavior. Last but not least, AfterLearnER requires only a minimal amount of feedback, i.e., a few dozens to a few hundreds of scalars, rather than the tens of thousands needed in most related published works. Compared to fine-tuning (typically using the same loss, and gradient-based optimization on a smaller but still big dataset at a fine grain), AfterLearnER uses a minimum amount of data on the real objective function without requiring differentiability.</p></details> |  |

Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include: (1) Deep compression autoencoder: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8$\times$, we trained an AE that can compress images 32$\times$, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens. (2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence. As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024$\times$1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.

This field relies on the accurate perception, understanding, and reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D data sources like images and videos. Diffusion models, originally designed for 2D generative tasks, offer the potential for more flexible, probabilistic approaches that can better capture the variability and uncertainty present in real-world 3D data. However, traditional methods often struggle with efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art approaches that leverage diffusion models for 3D visual tasks, including but not limited to 3D object generation, shape completion, point cloud reconstruction, and scene understanding. We provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying mathematical principles of diffusion models, outlining their forward and reverse processes, as well as the various architectural advancements that enable these models to work with 3D datasets. We also discuss the key challenges in applying diffusion models to 3D vision, such as handling occlusions and varying point densities, and the computational demands of high-dimensional data.

We propose Pose-dIVE, a novel data augmentation approach that incorporates sparse and underrepresented human pose and camera viewpoint examples into the training data, addressing the limited diversity in the original training data distribution. Our objective is to augment the training dataset to enable existing Re-ID models to learn features unbiased by human pose and camera viewpoint variations. To achieve this, we leverage the knowledge of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. By conditioning the diffusion model on both the human pose and camera viewpoint concurrently through the SMPL model, we generate training data with diverse human poses and camera viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in addressing human pose bias and enhancing the generalizability of Re-ID models compared to other data augmentation-based Re-ID approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose Diff-SAGe, an end-to-end, flow-based diffusion-transformer model for this task. Diff-SAGe utilizes a complex spectrogram representation for FOA, preserving the phase information crucial for accurate spatial cues. Additionally, a multi-conditional encoder integrates the input conditions into a unified representation, guiding the generation of FOA waveforms from noise. Through extensive evaluations on two datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional simulation-based baselines across both objective and subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |

The remarkable empirical success of these models applied to high-dimensional signals, including images and video, stands in stark contrast to classical results highlighting the curse of dimensionality for distribution recovery. In this work, we take a step towards understanding this gap through a careful analysis of learning diffusion models over the Barron space of single layer neural networks. In particular, we show that these shallow models provably adapt to simple forms of low dimensional structure, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We combine our results with recent analyses of sampling with diffusion models to provide an end-to-end sample complexity bound for learning to sample from structured distributions. Importantly, our results do not require specialized architectures tailored to particular latent structures, and instead rely on the low-index structure of the Barron space to adapt to the underlying distribution.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on large-scale clean datasets for training limits their applicability in scenarios where acquiring clean data is costly or impractical. Recent approaches have attempted to learn diffusion models directly from corrupted measurements, but these methods either lack theoretical convergence guarantees or are restricted to specific types of data corruption. In this paper, we propose a principled expectation-maximization (EM) framework that iteratively learns diffusion models from noisy data with arbitrary corruption types. Our framework employs a plug-and-play Monte Carlo method to accurately estimate clean images from noisy measurements, followed by training the diffusion model using the reconstructed images. This process alternates between estimation and training until convergence. We evaluate the performance of our method across various imaging tasks, including inpainting, denoising, and deblurring. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables the learning of high-fidelity diffusion priors from noisy data, significantly enhancing reconstruction quality in imaging inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain.

With massive efforts being dedicated to personalized generation, a promising extension is personalized editing, namely to edit an image using personalized concepts, which can provide a more precise guidance signal than traditional textual guidance. To address this, a straightforward solution is to incorporate a personalized diffusion model with a text-driven editing framework. However, such a solution often shows unsatisfactory editability on the source image. To address this, we propose DreamSteerer, a plug-in method for augmenting existing T2I personalization methods. Specifically, we enhance the source image conditioned editability of a personalized diffusion model via a novel Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) objective. Moreover, we identify a mode trapping issue with EDSD, and propose a mode shifting regularization with spatial feature guided sampling to avoid such an issue. We further employ two key modifications to the Delta Denoising Score framework that enable high-fidelity local editing with personalized concepts. Extensive experiments validate that DreamSteerer can significantly improve the editability of several T2I personalization baselines while being computationally efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue.

Our model integrates a kinematics-aware deformable model and Gaussians Splatting and is compatible with any robot form factors and degrees of freedom. We demonstrate its capability and usage in applications including reconstruction of robot poses from images and controlling robots through vision language models. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our differentiable rendering model provides effective gradients for robotic control directly from pixels, setting the foundation for the future applications of vision foundation models in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://drrobot.cs.columbia.edu/</p></details> |
| **[Deep Generative Models Unveil Patterns in Medical Images Through Vision-Language Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13823v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models have significantly advanced medical imaging analysis by enhancing dataset size and quality. Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns. Our methods offer a new avenue for the early detection and precise visualization of complex clinical conditions with deep generative models.

| **[The Impact of Visual Information in Chinese Characters: Evaluating Large Models' Ability to Recognize and Utilize Radicals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09013v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language processing (CLP) tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{Arcana}, a multiModal language model, which introduces two crucial techniques. First, we present Multimodal LoRA (MM-LoRA), a module designed to enhance the decoder. Unlike traditional language-driven decoders, MM-LoRA consists of two parallel LoRAs -- one for vision and one for language -- each with its own parameters. This disentangled parameters design allows for more specialized learning in each modality and better integration of multimodal information. Second, we introduce the Query Ladder adapter (QLadder) to improve the visual encoder. QLadder employs a learnable ``\textit{ladder}'' structure to deeply aggregates the intermediate representations from the frozen pretrained visual encoder (e.g., CLIP image encoder). This enables the model to learn new and informative visual features, as well as remaining the powerful capabilities of the pretrained visual encoder. These techniques collectively enhance Arcana's visual perception power, enabling it to leverage improved visual information for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs across various multimodal scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our Arcana. The code and re-annotated data are available at \url{https://arcana-project-page.github.io}.</p></details> |  |

A similar ability is desirable for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While state-of-the-art models are rapidly closing the gap with human-level performance on diverse computer vision and NLP tasks separately, they struggle to solve tasks that require joint reasoning over visual and textual modalities. Inspired by GLUE (Wang et. al., 2018)- a multitask benchmark for natural language understanding, we propose VL-GLUE in this paper. VL-GLUE consists of over 100k samples spanned across seven different tasks, which at their core require visuo-linguistic reasoning. Moreover, our benchmark comprises of diverse image types (from synthetically rendered figures, and day-to-day scenes to charts and complex diagrams) and includes a broad variety of domain-specific text (from cooking, politics, and sports to high-school curricula), demonstrating the need for multi-modal understanding in the real-world. We show that this benchmark is quite challenging for existing large-scale vision-language models and encourage development of systems that possess robust visuo-linguistic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

These models require strong language understanding and visual capabilities to enhance human-machine interaction. To address this need, we present H2OVL-Mississippi, a pair of small VLMs trained on 37 million image-text pairs using 240 hours of compute on 8 x H100 GPUs. H2OVL-Mississippi-0.8B is a tiny model with 0.8 billion parameters that specializes in text recognition, achieving state of the art performance on the Text Recognition portion of OCRBench and surpassing much larger models in this area. Additionally, we are releasing H2OVL-Mississippi-2B, a 2 billion parameter model for general use cases, exhibiting highly competitive metrics across various academic benchmarks. Both models build upon our prior work with H2O-Danube language models, extending their capabilities into the visual domain. We release them under the Apache 2.0 license, making VLMs accessible to everyone, democratizing document AI and visual LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoCoder: Solving Geometry Problems by Generating Modular Code through Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13510v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometry problem-solving demands advanced reasoning abilities to process multimodal inputs and employ mathematical knowledge effectively. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in various multimodal tasks. Yet, they still struggle with geometry problems and are significantly limited by their inability to perform mathematical operations not seen during pre-training, such as calculating the cosine of an arbitrary angle, and by difficulties in correctly applying relevant geometry formulas. To overcome these challenges, we present GeoCoder, which leverages modular code-finetuning to generate and execute code using a predefined geometry function library. By executing the code, we achieve accurate and deterministic calculations, contrasting the stochastic nature of autoregressive token prediction, while the function library minimizes errors in formula usage. We also propose a multimodal retrieval-augmented variant of GeoCoder, named RAG-GeoCoder, which incorporates a non-parametric memory module for retrieving functions from the geometry library, thereby reducing reliance on parametric memory. Our modular code-finetuning approach enhances the geometric reasoning capabilities of VLMs, yielding an average improvement of over 16% across various question complexities on the GeomVerse dataset compared to other finetuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MirrorCheck: Efficient Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09250v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks as various novel attack strategies are being proposed against these models. While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs for Long-term Language-Guided Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11989v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling mobile robots to perform long-term tasks in dynamic real-world environments is a formidable challenge, especially when the environment changes frequently due to human-robot interactions or the robot's own actions. Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Summary-Guided Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13321v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p></details> |  |

| **[OpenDAS: Open-Vocabulary Domain Adaptation for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20141v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.</p></details> |  |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies. https://sites.google.com/corp/view/safe-robots</p></details> |  |

A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness between LLaVa and CLIP models. However, scene based datasets like PATA, VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their construction. As for pronoun based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a more difficult version of VisoGender to serve as a more rigorous evaluation. Based on these results, we call for more effective and carefully designed datasets to ensure VLMs are both fair and reliable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on medical VQA and report generation tasks across three datasets, achieving an average improvement of 47.4% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |

However, reliably quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries is challenging as it requires visually verifying each claim within the response. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model (LLM) with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a hyper-detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate diverse question-answer (QA) pairs, as well as programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.5k challenging but visually grounded QA pairs. Next, to evaluate free-form model responses to queries in PROVE, we propose a programmatic evaluation strategy that measures both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a response within a unified scene graph-based framework. We benchmark the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-offs of a range of VLMs on PROVE, finding that very few are in-fact able to achieve a good balance between the two.

As all images need to be converted into image tokens to fit the input format of large language models (LLMs) along with natural language prompts, sequential visual representation is essential to the performance of LVLMs, and the information flow analysis approach can be an effective tool for determining interactions between these representations. In this paper, we propose integrating attention analysis with LLaVA-CAM, concretely, attention scores highlight relevant regions during forward propagation, while LLaVA-CAM captures gradient changes through backward propagation, revealing key image features. By exploring the information flow from the perspective of visual representation contribution, we observe that it tends to converge in shallow layers but diversify in deeper layers. To validate our analysis, we conduct comprehensive experiments with truncation strategies across various LVLMs for visual question answering and image captioning tasks, and experimental results not only verify our hypothesis but also reveal a consistent pattern of information flow convergence in the corresponding layers, and the information flow cliff layer will be different due to different contexts.

| **[Self-Comparison for Dataset-Level Membership Inference in Large (Vision-)Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13088v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in a wide range of natural language processing and vision-language tasks. Access to large web-scale datasets has been a key factor in their success. However, concerns have been raised about the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials and potential copyright infringement. Existing methods, such as sample-level Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and distribution-based dataset inference, distinguish member data (data used for training) and non-member data by leveraging the common observation that models tend to memorize and show greater confidence in member data. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges when applied to LLMs and VLMs, such as the requirement for ground-truth member data or non-member data that shares the same distribution as the test data. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset-level membership inference method based on Self-Comparison. We find that a member prefix followed by a non-member suffix (paraphrased from a member suffix) can further trigger the model's memorization on training data. Instead of directly comparing member and non-member data, we introduce paraphrasing to the second half of the sequence and evaluate how the likelihood changes before and after paraphrasing. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require access to ground-truth member data or non-member data in identical distribution, making it more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional MIA and dataset inference techniques across various datasets and models, including including public models, fine-tuned models, and API-based commercial models.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> |  |

However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate visual fairness in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for bias mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future bias reduction efforts.</p></details> | Under review |

However, such models are tricky to efficiently train and often struggle to generalize beyond their training scenarios, limiting adaptability to new environments, tasks, and concepts. In this work, we investigate the minimal data requirements and architectural adaptations necessary to achieve robust closed-loop performance with vision-based control policies under unseen text instructions and visual distribution shifts. To this end, we design datasets with various levels of data representation richness, refine feature extraction protocols by leveraging multi-modal foundation model encoders, and assess the suitability of different policy network heads. Our findings are synthesized in Flex (Fly-lexically), a framework that uses pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) as frozen patch-wise feature extractors, generating spatially aware embeddings that integrate semantic and visual information. These rich features form the basis for training highly robust downstream policies capable of generalizing across platforms, environments, and text-specified tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on quadrotor fly-to-target tasks, where agents trained via behavior cloning on a small simulated dataset successfully generalize to real-world scenes, handling diverse novel goals and command formulations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BlabberSeg, an optimized Vision-Language Model built on CLIPSeg for on-board, real-time processing of aerial images by UAVs. BlabberSeg improves the efficiency of CLIPSeg by reusing prompt and model features, reducing computational overhead while achieving real-time open-vocabulary aerial segmentation. We validated BlabberSeg in a safe landing scenario using the Dynamic Open-Vocabulary Enhanced SafE-Landing with Intelligence (DOVESEI) framework, which uses visual servoing and open-vocabulary segmentation. BlabberSeg reduces computational costs significantly, with a speed increase of 927.41% (16.78 Hz) on a NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX (64GB) compared with the original CLIPSeg (1.81Hz), achieving real-time aerial segmentation with negligible loss in accuracy (2.1% as the ratio of the correctly segmented area with respect to CLIPSeg).

Recently, researchers have applied this setting to advanced pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), developing approaches such as test-time prompt tuning to further extend their practical applicability. However, these methods typically focus solely on adapting VLMs from a single modality and fail to accumulate task-specific knowledge as more samples are processed. To address this, we introduce Dual Prototype Evolving (DPE), a novel test-time adaptation approach for VLMs that effectively accumulates task-specific knowledge from multi-modalities. Specifically, we create and evolve two sets of prototypes--textual and visual--to progressively capture more accurate multi-modal representations for target classes during test time. Moreover, to promote consistent multi-modal representations, we introduce and optimize learnable residuals for each test sample to align the prototypes from both modalities. Extensive experimental results on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DPE consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while also exhibiting competitive computational efficiency.

Critical to their coexistence and cooperation with humans is the ability to understand natural language communications and exhibit human-like behaviors. This work focuses on generating diverse whole-body motions for humanoid robots from language descriptions. We leverage human motion priors from extensive human motion datasets to initialize humanoid motions and employ the commonsense reasoning capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to edit and refine these motions.

Multiple-choice question and answer (QA) datasets derived from national medical examinations have long served as valuable evaluation tools, but existing datasets are largely text-only and available in a limited subset of languages and countries. To address these challenges, we present WorldMedQA-V, an updated multilingual, multimodal benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate VLMs in healthcare. WorldMedQA-V includes 568 labeled multiple-choice QAs paired with 568 medical images from four countries (Brazil, Israel, Japan, and Spain), covering original languages and validated English translations by native clinicians, respectively. Baseline performance for common open- and closed-source models are provided in the local language and English translations, and with and without images provided to the model. The WorldMedQA-V benchmark aims to better match AI systems to the diverse healthcare environments in which they are deployed, fostering more equitable, effective, and representative applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for review, total of 14 pages</p></details> |

To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</p></details> |  |
| **[VividMed: Vision Language Model with Versatile Visual Grounding for Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12694v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable promise in generating visually grounded responses. However, their application in the medical domain is hindered by unique challenges. For instance, most VLMs rely on a single method of visual grounding, whereas complex medical tasks demand more versatile approaches. Additionally, while most VLMs process only 2D images, a large portion of medical images are 3D. The lack of medical data further compounds these obstacles. To address these challenges, we present VividMed, a vision language model with versatile visual grounding for medicine. Our model supports generating both semantic segmentation masks and instance-level bounding boxes, and accommodates various imaging modalities, including both 2D and 3D data. We design a three-stage training procedure and an automatic data synthesis pipeline based on open datasets and models. Besides visual grounding tasks, VividMed also excels in other common downstream tasks, including Visual Question Answering (VQA) and report generation. Ablation studies empirically show that the integration of visual grounding ability leads to improved performance on these tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/function2-llx/MMMM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Figurative Meaning through Explainable Visual Entailment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01474v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks requiring a fine-grained understanding of literal meaning in images and text, such as visual question-answering or visual entailment. However, there has been little exploration of these models' capabilities when presented with images and captions containing figurative meaning, such as metaphors or humor. To close this gap, we propose a new task framing the figurative meaning understanding problem as an explainable visual entailment task, where the model has to predict whether the image (premise) entails a caption (hypothesis) and justify the predicted label with a textual explanation. The figurative phenomena can be present either in the image, the caption, or both. Utilizing a human-AI collaboration approach, we build the accompanying expert-verified dataset V-FLUTE, containing 6,027 {image, caption, label, explanation} instances spanning five diverse figurative phenomena: metaphors, similes, idioms, sarcasm, and humor. Through automatic evaluation, we find that VLMs struggle to generalize from literal to figurative meaning, particularly when it is present in images. Further, we identify common types of errors in VLM reasoning via human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Modal Safety Mechanism Transfer in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12662v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language alignment in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) successfully enables LLMs to understand visual input. However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).</p></details> |  |

However, detecting an object's state and generating a state-sensitive plan for robots is challenging. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plans. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is hardly any investigation on whether LLMs or VLMs can also generate object state-sensitive plans. To study this, we introduce an Object State-Sensitive Agent (OSSA), a task-planning agent empowered by pre-trained neural networks. We propose two methods for OSSA: (i) a modular model consisting of a pre-trained vision processing module (dense captioning model, DCM) and a natural language processing model (LLM), and (ii) a monolithic model consisting only of a VLM. To quantitatively evaluate the performances of the two methods, we use tabletop scenarios where the task is to clear the table. We contribute a multimodal benchmark dataset that takes object states into consideration. Our results show that both methods can be used for object state-sensitive tasks, but the monolithic approach outperforms the modular approach. The code for OSSA is available at https://github.com/Xiao-wen-Sun/OSSA</p></details> | ICANN24, Switzerland |

Despite the varying significance of different textual elements within a sentence depending on the context, efforts to account for variation of importance in constructing text embeddings have been lacking. We propose a framework of Semantic Token Reweighting to build Interpretable text embeddings (SToRI), which incorporates controllability as well. SToRI refines the text encoding process in CLIP by differentially weighting semantic elements based on contextual importance, enabling finer control over emphasis responsive to data-driven insights and user preferences. The efficacy of SToRI is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on few-shot image classification and image retrieval tailored to user preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

However, current benchmarks focus on tasks that evaluating only a single aspect of LVLM capabilities (e.g., recognition, detection, understanding). These tasks fail to fully demonstrate LVLMs' potential in complex application scenarios. To comprehensively assess the performance of existing LVLMs, we propose a more challenging task called the Flow Text with Image Insertion task (FTII). This task requires LVLMs to simultaneously possess outstanding abilities in image comprehension, instruction understanding, and long-text interpretation. Specifically, given several text paragraphs and a set of candidate images, as the text paragraphs accumulate, the LVLMs are required to select the most suitable image from the candidates to insert after the corresponding paragraph. Constructing a benchmark for such a task is highly challenging, particularly in determining the sequence of flowing text and images. To address this challenge, we turn to professional news reports, which naturally contain a gold standard for image-text sequences. Based on this, we introduce the Flow Text with Image Insertion Benchmark (FTII-Bench), which includes 318 high-quality Chinese image-text news articles and 307 high-quality English image-text news articles, covering 10 different news domains. Using these 625 high-quality articles, we construct problems of two different types with multiple levels of difficulty. Furthermore, we establish two different evaluation pipelines based on the CLIP model and existing LVLMs. We evaluate 9 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs as well as 2 CLIP-based models. Results indicate that even the most advanced models (e.g., GPT-4o) face significant challenges when tackling the FTII task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Experts Made Personalized: Federated Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10114v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning for pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP has demonstrated potent applicability across diverse downstream tasks. This lightweight approach has quickly gained traction from federated learning (FL) researchers who seek to efficiently adapt VLMs to heterogeneous scenarios. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data on the client, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. The non-local experts are sparsely selected from a server-maintained pool, fostering collaborative learning across clients. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments across 9 datasets under various heterogeneous federated settings. The results show that pFedMoAP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, underscoring its efficacy in personalizing prompt learning for CLIP within the federated learning paradigm.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

These models embed multimodal facts within their parameters, rather than relying on external knowledge bases to store factual information explicitly. However, the content discerned by LVLMs may deviate from actual facts due to inherent bias or incorrect inference. To address this issue, we introduce MFC-Bench, a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of LVLMs across three stages of verdict prediction for MFC: Manipulation, Out-of-Context, and Veracity Classification. Through our evaluation on MFC-Bench, we benchmarked a dozen diverse and representative LVLMs, uncovering that current models still fall short in multimodal fact-checking and demonstrate insensitivity to various forms of manipulated content. We hope that MFC-Bench could raise attention to the trustworthy AI potentially assisted by LVLMs in the future. The MFC-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://github.com/wskbest/MFC-Bench, contributing to ongoing research in the multimodal fact-checking field.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |

Previous works primarily focus on prompt learning to adapt the CLIP into a variety of downstream tasks, however, suffering from task overfitting when fine-tuned on a small data set. In this paper, we introduce an orthogonal fine-tuning method for efficiently fine-tuning pretrained weights and enabling enhanced robustness and generalization, while a self-regularization strategy is further exploited to maintain the stability in terms of zero-shot generalization of VLMs, dubbed OrthSR. Specifically, trainable orthogonal matrices are injected seamlessly into the transformer architecture and enforced with orthogonality constraint during the training, benefiting from the norm-preserving property and thus leading to stable and faster convergence, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen. To alleviate deviation from fine-tuning, a self-regularization strategy is further employed to retain the generalization of the model during the training within a bypass manner. In addition, to enrich the sample diversity for downstream tasks under the small dataset scenario, we first explore attentive CutOut data augmentation to boost the efficient fine-tuning, leading to better model fitting capacity for specific downstream task. Then we support the theoretical analysis on how our approach improves the specific downstream performance and maintains the generalizability. For the first time, we revisit the CLIP and CoOp with our method to effectively improve the model on few-shot image classficiation scenario on par with the elaborated prompt learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Large-scale pre-training plays a critical role in building capable LVLMs, while evaluating its training quality without the costly supervised fine-tuning stage is under-explored. Loss, perplexity, and in-context evaluation results are commonly used pre-training metrics for Large Language Models (LLMs), while we observed that these metrics are less indicative when aligning a well-trained LLM with a new modality. Due to the lack of proper metrics, the research of LVLMs in the critical pre-training stage is hindered greatly, including the training data choice, efficient module design, etc. In this paper, we propose evaluating the pre-training quality from the inter-modal distribution distance perspective and present MIR, the Modality Integration Rate, which is 1) \textbf{Effective} to represent the pre-training quality and show a positive relation with the benchmark performance after supervised fine-tuning. 2) \textbf{Robust} toward different training/evaluation data. 3) \textbf{Generalize} across training configurations and architecture choices. We conduct a series of pre-training experiments to explore the effectiveness of MIR and observe satisfactory results that MIR is indicative about training data selection, training strategy schedule, and model architecture design to get better pre-training results. We hope MIR could be a helpful metric for building capable LVLMs and inspire the following research about modality alignment in different areas.

| **[Leveraging Large Vision Language Model For Better Automatic Web GUI Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12157v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of web technology, more and more software applications have become web-based in the past decades. To ensure software quality and user experience, various techniques have been proposed to automatically test web applications by interacting with their GUIs. To achieve high functional coverage, web GUI testing tools often need to generate high-quality text inputs and interact with the associated GUI elements (e.g., click submit buttons). However, developing a holistic approach that solves both subtasks is challenging because the web GUI context can be complicated and highly dynamic, which makes it hard to process programmatically. The recent development of large vision-language models (LVLM) provides new opportunities to handle these longstanding problems. This paper proposes VETL, the first LVLM-driven end-to-end web testing technique. With LVLM's scene understanding capabilities, VETL can generate valid and meaningful text inputs focusing on the local context, while avoiding the need to extract precise textual attributes. The selection of associated GUI elements is formulated as a visual question-answering problem, allowing LVLM to capture the logical connection between the input box and the relevant element based on visual instructions. Further, the GUI exploration is guided by a multi-armed bandit module employing a curiosity-oriented strategy. Experiments show that VETL effectively explores web state/action spaces and detects bugs. Compared with WebExplor, the state-of-the-art web testing technique, VETL can discover 25% more unique web actions on benchmark websites. Moreover, it can expose functional bugs in top-ranking commercial websites, which the website maintainers have confirmed. Our work makes the first attempt at leveraging LVLM in end-to-end GUI testing, demonstrating promising results in this research direction.</p></details> |  |

However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved 2x with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

The key challenge to address under the condition of limited training data is how to fine-tune pre-trained vision-language models in a parameter-efficient manner. Previously, numerous approaches tackling this challenge have been proposed. Meantime, a few survey papers are also published to summarize these works. However, there still lacks a unified computational framework to integrate existing methods together, identify their nature and support in-depth comparison. As such, this survey paper first proposes a unified computational framework from the perspective of Representer Theorem and then derives many of the existing methods by specializing this framework. Thereafter, a comparative analysis is conducted to uncover the differences and relationships between existing methods. Based on the analyses, some possible variants to improve the existing works are presented. As a demonstration, we extend existing methods by modeling inter-class correlation between representers in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which is implemented by exploiting the closed-form solution of kernel ridge regression. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of this method. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the limitations and provide further research directions.</p></details> |  |

However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon planning tasks. To address these limitations, we present Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS) and Exploratory Learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce R-MCTS, a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the ability of AI agents to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning usually requires 'white-box' access to the model's architecture and weights, which is not always feasible due to proprietary or privacy concerns. In this work, we propose LLM-wrapper, a method for 'black-box' adaptation of VLMs for the REC task using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLM-wrapper capitalizes on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, improved with a light fine-tuning, to select the most relevant bounding box matching the referring expression, from candidates generated by a zero-shot black-box VLM. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the adaptation of closed-source models without needing access to their internal workings, it is versatile as it works with any VLM, it transfers to new VLMs, and it allows for the adaptation of an ensemble of VLMs. We evaluate LLM-wrapper on multiple datasets using different VLMs and LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements and highlighting the versatility of our method. While LLM-wrapper is not meant to directly compete with standard white-box fine-tuning, it offers a practical and effective alternative for black-box VLM adaptation.

To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Based on a large-scale pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM), our model learns and improves visual, textual, and numerical representations of patient gait videos, through a collective learning across three distinct modalities: gait videos, class-specific descriptions, and numerical gait parameters. Our specific contributions are two-fold: First, we adopt a knowledge-aware prompt tuning strategy to utilize the class-specific medical description in guiding the text prompt learning. Second, we integrate the paired gait parameters in the form of numerical texts to enhance the numeracy of the textual representation. Results demonstrate that our model not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video-based classification tasks but also adeptly decodes the learned class-specific text features into natural language descriptions using the vocabulary of quantitative gait parameters. The code and the model will be made available at our project page: https://lisqzqng.github.io/GaitAnalysisVLM/.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |
| **[PAVLM: Advancing Point Cloud based Affordance Understanding Via Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11564v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance understanding, the task of identifying actionable regions on 3D objects, plays a vital role in allowing robotic systems to engage with and operate within the physical world. Although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have excelled in high-level reasoning and long-horizon planning for robotic manipulation, they still fall short in grasping the nuanced physical properties required for effective human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce PAVLM (Point cloud Affordance Vision-Language Model), an innovative framework that utilizes the extensive multimodal knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to enhance 3D affordance understanding of point cloud. PAVLM integrates a geometric-guided propagation module with hidden embeddings from large language models (LLMs) to enrich visual semantics. On the language side, we prompt Llama-3.1 models to generate refined context-aware text, augmenting the instructional input with deeper semantic cues. Experimental results on the 3D-AffordanceNet benchmark demonstrate that PAVLM outperforms baseline methods for both full and partial point clouds, particularly excelling in its generalization to novel open-world affordance tasks of 3D objects.

In this work, we introduce relevance hallucination and factuality hallucination as a new typology for hallucination problems brought by query generation based on LLMs. We propose an effective way to separate content from form in LLM-generated queries, which preserves the factual knowledge extracted and integrated from the inputs and compiles the syntactic structure, including function words, using the powerful linguistic capabilities of the LLM. Specifically, we introduce a model-agnostic and training-free method that turns the Large Language Model into a Pointer-Generator (LargePiG), where the pointer attention distribution leverages the LLM's inherent attention weights, and the copy probability is derived from the difference between the vocabulary distribution of the model's high layers and the last layer. To validate the effectiveness of LargePiG, we constructed two datasets for assessing the hallucination problems in query generation, covering both document and video scenarios. Empirical studies on various LLMs demonstrated the superiority of LargePiG on both datasets. Additional experiments also verified that LargePiG could reduce hallucination in large vision language models and improve the accuracy of document-based question-answering and factuality evaluation tasks.</p></details> | 24 pages |

In this paper, we empirically investigate what text prompt encoders (e.g., CLIP or LLM) are good for adapting SAM for referring expression segmentation and introduce the Early Vision-language Fusion-based SAM (EVF-SAM). EVF-SAM is a simple yet effective referring segmentation method which exploits multimodal prompts (i.e., image and text) and comprises a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts and a SAM model for segmentation. Surprisingly, we observe that: (1) multimodal prompts and (2) vision-language models with early fusion (e.g., BEIT-3) are beneficial for prompting SAM for accurate referring segmentation. Our experiments show that the proposed EVF-SAM based on BEIT-3 can obtain state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g for referring expression segmentation and demonstrate the superiority of prompting SAM with early vision-language fusion. In addition, the proposed EVF-SAM with 1.32B parameters achieves remarkably higher performance while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing image database retrieval methods are limited by the impracticality of storing sufficient visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce smileGeo, a novel visual geo-localization framework that leverages multiple Internet-enabled LVLM agents operating within an agent-based architecture. By facilitating inter-agent communication, smileGeo integrates the inherent knowledge of these agents with additional retrieved information, enhancing the ability to effectively localize images. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a dynamic learning strategy that optimizes agent communication, reducing redundant interactions and enhancing overall system efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted experiments on three different datasets, and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

| **[CLIP-DFGS: A Hard Sample Mining Method for CLIP in Generalizable Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11255v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise in person re-identification (ReID) applications. However, their performance in generalizable person re-identification tasks remains suboptimal. The large-scale and diverse image-text pairs used in CLIP's pre-training may lead to a lack or insufficiency of certain fine-grained features. In light of these challenges, we propose a hard sample mining method called DFGS (Depth-First Graph Sampler), based on depth-first search, designed to offer sufficiently challenging samples to enhance CLIP's ability to extract fine-grained features. DFGS can be applied to both the image encoder and the text encoder in CLIP. By leveraging the powerful cross-modal learning capabilities of CLIP, we aim to apply our DFGS method to extract challenging samples and form mini-batches with high discriminative difficulty, providing the image model with more efficient and challenging samples that are difficult to distinguish, thereby enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between individuals. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over other methods, confirming the effectiveness of DFGS in providing challenging samples that enhance CLIP's performance in generalizable person re-identification.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TOMM |
| **[Tree of Attributes Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11201v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoAgent: Self-Improving Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10076v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation has been used to generate visual plans for controlling robotic systems. Given an image observation and a language instruction, previous work has generated video plans which are then converted to robot controls to be executed. However, a major bottleneck in leveraging video generation for control lies in the quality of the generated videos, which often suffer from hallucinatory content and unrealistic physics, resulting in low task success when control actions are extracted from the generated videos. While scaling up dataset and model size provides a partial solution, integrating external feedback is both natural and essential for grounding video generation in the real world. With this observation, we propose VideoAgent for self-improving generated video plans based on external feedback. Instead of directly executing the generated video plan, VideoAgent first refines the generated video plans using a novel procedure which we call self-conditioning consistency, utilizing feedback from a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). As the refined video plan is being executed, VideoAgent collects additional data from the environment to further improve video plan generation. Experiments in simulated robotic manipulation from MetaWorld and iTHOR show that VideoAgent drastically reduces hallucination, thereby boosting success rate of downstream manipulation tasks. We further illustrate that VideoAgent can effectively refine real-robot videos, providing an early indicator that robotics can be an effective tool in grounding video generation in the physical world.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

However, despite these improvements, existing vision transformers (ViTs) still struggle to capture fine-grained details from less prominent objects, charts, and embedded text, limiting their effectiveness in certain tasks. In this paper, we extend recent high-resolution and multi-crop techniques by not only preserving the native resolution, but zooming in beyond it and extracting features from a large number of image sub-crops. This enhancement allows our model to better capture fine-grained details, overcoming the limitations of current ViTs. To manage the increased token count and computational complexity, we demonstrate that a simple mean-pooling aggregation over tokens is effective. Our model, Dragonfly, achieves competitive performance on general-domain tasks such as ScienceQA and AI2D, and excels in tasks requiring fine-grained image understanding, including TextVQA and ChartQA. Among models in the 7-8B parameter range, Dragonfly consistently ranks at the top across ten general-domain benchmarks, achieving the highest or second-highest scores in most cases, outperforming models that are significantly larger or trained on larger datasets. Our biomedical model, Dragonfly-Med, sets new benchmarks on several medical tasks, achieving 91.6% accuracy on SLAKE (compared to 84.8% for Med-Gemini), a 67.1% token F1 score on Path-VQA (compared to 62.7% for Med-PaLM M), and state-of-the-art results across the majority of image captioning tasks. Overall, our work highlights the persistent challenge of engineering visual representations with fixed-resolution ViTs, and proposes a simple yet effective solution to address this issue and boost performance in both general and specialized domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locality Alignment Improves Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11087v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this by ensuring that the vision backbone effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability -- pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at a patch-level semantic segmentation task, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure complements existing VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoRA-VLM: Robust Retrieval-Augmented Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08876v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language models (VLMs) still exhibit inferior performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, primarily due to the challenge of accurately encoding all the associations between visual objects and scenes to their corresponding entities and background knowledge. While retrieval augmentation methods offer an efficient way to integrate external knowledge, extending them to vision-language domain presents unique challenges in (1) precisely retrieving relevant information from external sources due to the inherent discrepancy within the multimodal queries, and (2) being resilient to the irrelevant, extraneous and noisy information contained in the retrieved multimodal knowledge snippets. In this work, we introduce RORA-VLM, a novel and robust retrieval augmentation framework specifically tailored for VLMs, with two key innovations: (1) a 2-stage retrieval process with image-anchored textual-query expansion to synergistically combine the visual and textual information in the query and retrieve the most relevant multimodal knowledge snippets; and (2) a robust retrieval augmentation method that strengthens the resilience of VLMs against irrelevant information in the retrieved multimodal knowledge by injecting adversarial noises into the retrieval-augmented training process, and filters out extraneous visual information, such as unrelated entities presented in images, via a query-oriented visual token refinement strategy. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed methods on three widely adopted benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that with a minimal amount of training instance, RORA-VLM enables the base model to achieve significant performance improvement and constantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented VLMs on all benchmarks while also exhibiting a novel zero-shot domain transfer capability.</p></details> |  |

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark that covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we revisit the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in the context of recent foundational VLMs. First, we point out that zero-shot predictions from VLMs such as GroundingDINO significantly outperform state-of-the-art few-shot detectors (48 vs. 33 AP) on COCO. Despite their strong zero-shot performance, such foundation models may still be sub-optimal. For example, trucks on the web may be defined differently from trucks for a target application such as autonomous vehicle perception. We argue that the task of few-shot recognition can be reformulated as aligning foundation models to target concepts using a few examples. Interestingly, such examples can be multi-modal, using both text and visual cues, mimicking instructions that are often given to human annotators when defining a target concept of interest. Concretely, we propose Foundational FSOD, a new benchmark protocol that evaluates detectors pre-trained on any external data and fine-tuned on multi-modal (text and visual) K-shot examples per target class. We repurpose nuImages for Foundational FSOD, benchmark several popular open-source VLMs, and provide an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2024 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 23.3 mAP!

This study takes the first step in exposing VLMs' susceptibility to data poisoning attacks that can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack where poison samples are visually indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditional Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveraging VLMs' text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rational narratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy. We show that Shadowcast effectively achieves the attacker's intentions using as few as 50 poison samples. Crucially, the poisoned samples demonstrate transferability across different VLM architectures, posing a significant concern in black-box settings. Moreover, Shadowcast remains potent under realistic conditions involving various text prompts, training data augmentation, and image compression techniques. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can disseminate convincing yet deceptive misinformation to everyday, benign users, emphasizing the importance of data integrity for responsible VLM deployments.

However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents. In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline. In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the document to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an image and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to traditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of the data information in the original documents, eliminating the information loss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and synthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of generation methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional RAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 25--39\% end-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis reveals that VisRAG is effective in utilizing training data and demonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches. One is for generating the bag-level feature by prototype-guided aggregating on the instance features. While the other is for enhancing the class feature through class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four TCGA datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, the training of CAV often necessitates a large number of high-quality images, which are expensive to curate and thus limited to a predefined set of concepts. To address this issue, we propose Language-Guided CAV (LG-CAV) to harness the abundant concept knowledge within the certain pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP). This method allows training any CAV without labeled data, by utilizing the corresponding concept descriptions as guidance. To bridge the gap between vision-language model and the target model, we calculate the activation values of concept descriptions on a common pool of images (probe images) with vision-language model and utilize them as language guidance to train the LG-CAV. Furthermore, after training high-quality LG-CAVs related to all the predicted classes in the target model, we propose the activation sample reweighting (ASR), serving as a model correction technique, to improve the performance of the target model in return. Experiments on four datasets across nine architectures demonstrate that LG-CAV achieves significantly superior quality to previous CAV methods given any concept, and our model correction method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing concept-based methods.

| **[Fine-grained Abnormality Prompt Learning for Zero-shot Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10289v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods show remarkable success in prompting large pre-trained vision-language models to detect anomalies in a target dataset without using any dataset-specific training or demonstration. However, these methods are often focused on crafting/learning prompts that capture only coarse-grained semantics of abnormality, e.g., high-level semantics like "damaged", "imperfect", or "defective" on carpet. They therefore have limited capability in recognizing diverse abnormality details with distinctive visual appearance, e.g., specific defect types like color stains, cuts, holes, and threads on carpet. To address this limitation, we propose FAPrompt, a novel framework designed to learn Fine-grained Abnormality Prompts for more accurate ZSAD. To this end, we introduce a novel compound abnormality prompting module in FAPrompt to learn a set of complementary, decomposed abnormality prompts, where each abnormality prompt is formed by a compound of shared normal tokens and a few learnable abnormal tokens. On the other hand, the fine-grained abnormality patterns can be very different from one dataset to another. To enhance their cross-dataset generalization, we further introduce a data-dependent abnormality prior module that learns to derive abnormality features from each query/test image as a sample-wise abnormality prior to ground the abnormality prompts in a given target dataset. Comprehensive experiments conducted across 19 real-world datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical anomalies, demonstrate that FAPrompt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 3%-5% AUC/AP in both image- and pixel-level ZSAD tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/FAPrompt.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |
| **[LOBG:Less Overfitting for Better Generalization in Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10247v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing prompt learning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have effectively enhanced the transfer capability of VLM to downstream tasks, but they suffer from a significant decline in generalization due to severe overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a framework named LOBG for vision-language models. Specifically, we use CLIP to filter out fine-grained foreground information that might cause overfitting, thereby guiding prompts with basic visual concepts. To further mitigate overfitting, we devel oped a structural topology preservation (STP) loss at the feature level, which endows the feature space with overall plasticity, allowing effective reshaping of the feature space during optimization. Additionally, we employed hierarchical logit distilation (HLD) at the output level to constrain outputs, complementing STP at the output end. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves generalization capability and alleviates overfitting compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10139v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[White-box Multimodal Jailbreaks Against Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17894v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Predict Performance of Large Models across Vision-Language Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10112v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) is very expensive, due to the high computational costs and the wide variety of tasks. The good news is that if we already have some observed performance scores, we may be able to infer unknown ones. In this study, we propose a new framework for predicting unknown performance scores based on observed ones from other LVLMs or tasks. We first formulate the performance prediction as a matrix completion task. Specifically, we construct a sparse performance matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$, where each entry $R_{mn}$ represents the performance score of the $m$-th model on the $n$-th dataset. By applying probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we can complete the performance matrix, that is, predict unknown scores. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty of performance prediction based on MCMC. Practitioners can evaluate their models on untested tasks with higher uncertainty first, quickly reducing errors in performance prediction. We further introduce several improvements to enhance PMF for scenarios with sparse observed performance scores. In experiments, we systematically evaluate 108 LVLMs on 176 datasets from 36 benchmarks, constructing training and testing sets for validating our framework. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy of PMF in predicting unknown scores, the reliability of uncertainty estimates in ordering evaluations, and the effectiveness of our enhancements for handling sparse data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |

Many recent approaches use Large Language Models (LLMs) for commonsense inference to improve exploration efficiency. However, the planning process of LLMs is limited within texts and it is difficult to represent the spatial occupancy and geometry layout only by texts. Both are important for making rational navigation decisions. In this work, we seek to unleash the spatial perception and planning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and explore whether the VLM, with only on-board camera captured RGB/RGB-D stream inputs, can efficiently finish the visual navigation tasks in a mapless manner. We achieve this by developing the imagination-powered navigation framework ImagineNav, which imagines the future observation images at valuable robot views and translates the complex navigation planning process into a rather simple best-view image selection problem for VLM. To generate appropriate candidate robot views for imagination, we introduce the Where2Imagine module, which is distilled to align with human navigation habits. Finally, to reach the VLM preferred views, an off-the-shelf point-goal navigation policy is utilized. Empirical experiments on the challenging open-vocabulary object navigation benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of our proposed system.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Towards Open-World Grasping with Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18722v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to grasp objects in-the-wild from open-ended language instructions constitutes a fundamental challenge in robotics. An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.

However, the generated text often suffers from inaccurate grounding in the visual input, resulting in errors such as hallucination of nonexistent scene elements, missing significant parts of the scene, and inferring incorrect attributes of and relationships between objects. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework, ViGoR (Visual Grounding Through Fine-Grained Reward Modeling) that utilizes fine-grained reward modeling to significantly enhance the visual grounding of LVLMs over pre-trained baselines. This improvement is efficiently achieved using much cheaper human evaluations instead of full supervisions, as well as automated methods. We show the effectiveness of our approach through a variety of evaluation methods and benchmarks. Additionally, we released our human annotation (https://github.com/amazon-science/vigor) comprising 15,440 images and generated text pairs with fine-grained evaluations to contribute to related research in the community.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied for both images and videos. However, these studies typically focus on common scenarios. In this work, we introduce an LVLM specifically designed for surgical scenarios. We integrate visual representations of surgical images and videos into the language feature space. Consequently, we establish a LVLM model, Surgical-LLaVA, fine-tuned on instruction following data of surgical scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that Surgical-LLaVA exhibits impressive multi-modal chat abilities in surgical contexts, occasionally displaying multi-modal behaviors on unseen instructions. We conduct a quantitative evaluation of visual question-answering datasets for surgical scenarios. The results show superior performance compared to previous works, indicating the potential of our model to tackle more complex surgery scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 AIM-FM Workshop</p></details> |

Despite VLMs' superior capabilities, researchers lack a comprehensive understanding of their compositionality -- the ability to understand and produce novel combinations of known visual and textual components. Prior benchmarks provide only a relatively rough compositionality evaluation from the perspectives of objects, relations, and attributes while neglecting deeper reasoning about object interactions, counting, and complex compositions. However, compositionality is a critical ability that facilitates coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities for VLMs. To address this limitation, we propose MMCOMPOSITION, a novel human-annotated benchmark for comprehensively and accurately evaluating VLMs' compositionality. Our proposed benchmark serves as a complement to these earlier works. With MMCOMPOSITION, we can quantify and explore the compositionality of the mainstream VLMs. Surprisingly, we find GPT-4o's compositionality inferior to the best open-source model, and we analyze the underlying reasons. Our experimental analysis reveals the limitations of VLMs in fine-grained compositional perception and reasoning, and points to areas for improvement in VLM design and training.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention model to weight video-specific interpretations that accurately maps the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic comprehensive clinical echocardiography interpretation. In datasets from two independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a safety-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model (aka the CLIP model) for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 40 pages, 7 figures |

While we have witnessed huge progress due to large-scale scene datasets, faster simulators, and stronger models, previous studies mainly focus on limited scene types and target objects. In this paper, we study a new task of navigating to diverse target objects in a large number of scene types. To benchmark the problem, we present a large-scale scene dataset, DivScene, which contains 4,614 scenes across 81 different types. With the dataset, we build an end-to-end embodied agent, NatVLM, by fine-tuning a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) through imitation learning. The LVLM is trained to take previous observations from the environment and generate the next actions. We also introduce CoT explanation traces of the action prediction for better performance when tuning LVLMs. Our extensive experiments find that we can build a performant LVLM-based agent through imitation learning on the shortest paths constructed by a BFS planner without any human supervision. Our agent achieves a success rate that surpasses GPT-4o by over 20%. Meanwhile, we carry out various analyses showing the generalization ability of our agent.

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence generated content, particularly in technologies like large language models for text generation and diffusion models for visual generation, have sparked widespread research interest in applying these multimodal models in the fashion domain. However, tasks involving embeddings, such as image-to-text or text-to-image retrieval, have been largely overlooked from this perspective due to the diverse nature of the multimodal fashion domain. And current research on multi-task single models lack focus on image generation. In this work, we present UniFashion, a unified framework that simultaneously tackles the challenges of multimodal generation and retrieval tasks within the fashion domain, integrating image generation with retrieval tasks and text generation tasks. UniFashion unifies embedding and generative tasks by integrating a diffusion model and LLM, enabling controllable and high-fidelity generation. Our model significantly outperforms previous single-task state-of-the-art models across diverse fashion tasks, and can be readily adapted to manage complex vision-language tasks.

However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations.

However, the absence of concrete descriptions necessitates the use of implicit text embeddings, which demand complicated and inefficient training strategies. To address this issue, we first propose one straightforward solution by leveraging existing image captioning models to generate pseudo captions for person images, and thereby boost person re-identification with large vision language models. Using models like the Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLAVA), we generate high-quality captions based on fixed templates that capture key semantic attributes such as gender, clothing, and age. By augmenting ReID training sets from uni-modality (image) to bi-modality (image and text), we introduce CLIP-SCGI, a simple yet effective framework that leverages synthesized captions to guide the learning of discriminative and robust representations. Built on CLIP, CLIP-SCGI fuses image and text embeddings through two modules to enhance the training process. To address quality issues in generated captions, we introduce a caption-guided inversion module that captures semantic attributes from images by converting relevant visual information into pseudo-word tokens based on the descriptions. This approach helps the model better capture key information and focus on relevant regions. The extracted features are then utilized in a cross-modal fusion module, guiding the model to focus on regions semantically consistent with the caption, thereby facilitating the optimization of the visual encoder to extract discriminative and robust representations. Extensive experiments on four popular ReID benchmarks demonstrate that CLIP-SCGI outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Description Grounding Reduces Hallucinations and Boosts Reasoning in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15683v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce responses that misalign with factual information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. While hallucinations are well-studied, the exact causes behind them remain underexplored. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of hallucinations in LVLMs. Our findings reveal that existing mitigation techniques primarily reduce hallucinations for visual recognition prompts-those that require simple descriptions of visual elements-but fail for cognitive prompts that demand deliberate reasoning. We identify the core issue as a lack of true visual perception in LVLMs: although they can accurately recognize visual elements, they struggle to fully interpret these elements in the context of the input prompt and effectively link this recognition to their internal knowledge, which is critical for reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce Visual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and training-free method designed to enhance visual perception and improve reasoning capabilities in LVLMs. VDGD works by first generating a detailed description of the image and appending it as a prefix to the instruction. During response generation, tokens are sampled based on their KL divergence to the description, favoring candidates with lower divergence. Experimental results on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate that VDGD consistently outperforms existing baselines 2% - 33%. Finally, we introduce VaLLu, a benchmark designed for comprehensive evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, existing methods for acquiring large-scale intentions bank on distilling large language models with human annotation for verification. Such an approach tends to generate product-centric intentions, overlook valuable visual information from product images, and incurs high costs for scalability. To address these issues, we introduce MIND, a multimodal framework that allows Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to infer purchase intentions from multimodal product metadata and prioritize human-centric ones. Using Amazon Review data, we apply MIND and create a multimodal intention knowledge base, which contains 1,264,441 million intentions derived from 126,142 co-buy shopping records across 107,215 products. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the high plausibility and typicality of our obtained intentions and validate the effectiveness of our distillation framework and filtering mechanism.

However, due to the imbalanced distribution of pre-trained datasets, CLIP suffers from the bias problem in real-world applications. Existing debiasing methods struggle to obtain sufficient image samples for minority groups and incur high costs for group labeling. To address the limitations, we propose a Text-Only Debiasing framework called TOD, leveraging a text-as-image training paradigm to mitigate visual biases. Specifically, this approach repurposes the text encoder to function as an image encoder, thereby eliminating the need for image data. Simultaneously, it utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate a balanced text dataset, which is then used for prompt tuning. However, we observed that the model overfits to the text modality because label names, serving as supervision signals, appear explicitly in the texts. To address this issue, we further introduce a Multi-Target Prediction (MTP) task that motivates the model to focus on complex contexts and distinguish between target and biased information. Extensive experiments on the Waterbirds and CelebA datasets show that our method significantly improves group robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results among image-free methods and even competitive performance compared to image-supervised methods. Furthermore, the proposed method can be adapted to challenging scenarios with multiple or unknown bias attributes, demonstrating its strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-Model-Assisted Bi-Level Programming for Reward Learning from Internet Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09286v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstrations, particularly from biological experts like humans and animals, often encounters significant data acquisition challenges. While recent approaches leverage internet videos for learning, they require complex, task-specific pipelines to extract and retarget motion data for the agent. In this work, we introduce a language-model-assisted bi-level programming framework that enables a reinforcement learning agent to directly learn its reward from internet videos, bypassing dedicated data preparation. The framework includes two levels: an upper level where a vision-language model (VLM) provides feedback by comparing the learner's behavior with expert videos, and a lower level where a large language model (LLM) translates this feedback into reward updates. The VLM and LLM collaborate within this bi-level framework, using a "chain rule" approach to derive a valid search direction for reward learning. We validate the method for reward learning from YouTube videos, and the results have shown that the proposed method enables efficient reward design from expert videos of biological agents for complex behavior synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling and Mitigating Safety Alignment Degradation of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09047v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as ''safety alignment degradation'' in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention.

The problem is challenging, as reasoning data consisting of multiple steps of visual and language processing are barely available. To overcome the challenge, we first introduce a least-to-most visual reasoning paradigm, which interleaves steps of decomposing a question into sub-questions and invoking external tools for resolving sub-questions. Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct $50$k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised fine-tuning, which is capable of generally enhancing the reasoning abilities of a wide range of existing VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments indicate that the visual reasoner can consistently and significantly improve four VLMs on four VQA benchmarks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/steven-ccq/VisualReasoner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the existing cache model overlooks three crucial aspects. 1) Pre-trained VLMs are mainly optimized for image-text similarity, neglecting the importance of image-image similarity, leading to a gap between pre-training and adaptation. 2) The current cache model is based on the Nadaraya-Watson (N-W) estimator, which disregards the intricate relationships among training samples while constructing weight function. 3) Under the condition of limited samples, the logits generated by cache model are of high uncertainty, directly using these logits without accounting for the confidence could be problematic. This work presents three calibration modules aimed at addressing the above challenges. Similarity Calibration refines the image-image similarity by using unlabeled images. We add a learnable projection layer with residual connection on top of the pre-trained image encoder of CLIP and optimize the parameters by minimizing self-supervised contrastive loss. Weight Calibration introduces a precision matrix into the weight function to adequately model the relation between training samples, transforming the existing cache model to a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor, which could be more accurate than N-W estimator. Confidence Calibration leverages the predictive variances computed by GP Regression to dynamically re-scale the logits of cache model, ensuring that the cache model's outputs are appropriately adjusted based on their confidence levels. Besides, to reduce the high complexity of GPs, we further propose a group-based learning strategy. Integrating the above designs, we propose both training-free and training-required variants. Extensive experiments on 11 few-shot classification datasets validate that the proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | submitted to IJCV |

However, these models are prone to parametric knowledge conflicts, which arise from inconsistencies of represented knowledge between their vision and language components. In this paper, we formally define the problem of $\textbf{cross-modality parametric knowledge conflict}$ and present a systematic approach to detect, interpret, and mitigate them. We introduce a pipeline that identifies conflicts between visual and textual answers, showing a persistently high conflict rate across modalities in recent LVLMs regardless of the model size. We further investigate how these conflicts interfere with the inference process and propose a contrastive metric to discern the conflicting samples from the others. Building on these insights, we develop a novel dynamic contrastive decoding method that removes undesirable logits inferred from the less confident modality components based on answer confidence. For models that do not provide logits, we also introduce two prompt-based strategies to mitigate the conflicts. Our methods achieve promising improvements in accuracy on both the ViQuAE and InfoSeek datasets. Specifically, using LLaVA-34B, our proposed dynamic contrastive decoding improves an average accuracy of 2.24%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://darthzhu.github.io/cross-modality-knowledge-conflict/</p></details> |

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing universal text embedding models that can generalize across tasks (e.g., MTEB). However, progress in learning universal multimodal embedding models has been relatively slow despite their importance. In this work, we aim to explore the potential for building universal embeddings capable of handling a wide range of downstream tasks. Our contributions are twofold: (1) MMEB (Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark), which covers 4 meta-tasks (i.e. classification, visual question answering, multimodal retrieval, and visual grounding) and 36 datasets, including 20 training and 16 evaluation datasets, and (2) VLM2Vec (Vision-Language Model -> Vector), a contrastive training framework that converts any state-of-the-art vision-language model into an embedding model via training on MMEB. Unlike previous models such as CLIP and BLIP, VLM2Vec can process any combination of images and text to generate a fixed-dimensional vector based on task instructions. We build a series of VLM2Vec models on Phi-3.5-V and evaluate them on MMEB's evaluation split. Our results show that VLM2Vec achieves an absolute average improvement of 10% to 20% over existing multimodal embedding models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets in MMEB.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'24</p></details> |

As an accessibility service typically provided by trained AD professionals, the generation of ADs demands significant human effort, making the process both time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have allowed for getting a step closer to automatic AD generation. This paper reviews the technologies pertinent to AD generation in the era of LLMs and VLMs: we discuss how state-of-the-art NLP and CV technologies can be applied to generate ADs and identify essential research directions for the future.</p></details> |  |

Limited by resource and application constrains, only sparsely-distributed transducer arrays can be applied, which necessitates advanced image reconstruction algorithms to overcome artifacts caused by using back-projection algorithm. However, high computing memory consumption of traditional iterative algorithms for large-scale 3D cases is practically unacceptable. Here, we propose a point cloud-based iterative algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein a 3D photoacoustic scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources. During the iterative reconstruction process, the properties of each Gaussian source, including peak intensities, standard deviations and means are stored in form of point cloud, then continuously optimized and adaptively undergoing destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction, thus manifesting the sliding ball adaptive growth effect. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality 3D large-scale PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely less memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v3)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods.

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of tasks, including reasoning, natural language understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and industrial applications, demonstrate StraGo's superior performance.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our experimental code at: https://aka.ms/metareflection-code</p></details> |

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Two Great Steps that Work Better Together](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930v2)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly taking the form of sophisticated modular pipelines, e.g., Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where each module may involve a distinct Language Model (LM) and an associated prompt template. These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy. We have released our new optimizers and benchmark in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

However, manual prompt engineering is both labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating the need for automated solutions. We introduce PromptWizard, a novel, fully automated framework for discrete prompt optimization, utilizing a self-evolving, self-adapting mechanism. Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures. Additionally, our cost analysis reveals a substantial reduction in API calls, token usage, and overall cost, demonstrating PromptWizard's efficiency, scalability, and advantages over existing prompt optimization strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability to news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first self-tuning prompting framework for news recommendation, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex news recommendation tasks. This framework incorporates a news recommender and a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process to enhance recommendations through automatic prompt engineering. Extensive experimental results with 400 users show that RecPrompt can achieve an improvement of 3.36% in AUC, 10.49% in MRR, 9.64% in nDCG@5, and 6.20% in nDCG@10 compared to deep neural models. Additionally, we introduce TopicScore, a novel metric to assess explainability by evaluating LLM's ability to summarize topics of interest for users.

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.</p></details> |  |

While existing prompt optimization methods automate this process, they rely solely on learning from incorrect samples, leading to a sub-optimal performance. Additionally, an unexplored challenge in the literature is prompts effective for prior models may not perform well on newer versions or different languages. We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages. LCP offers a systematic approach to prompt engineering, reducing manual effort in deploying LLMs across varied contexts.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to assist them in their work poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structural design, incurring high learning costs and it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts, especially for non-AI experts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a structural prompt design framework. Furthermore, we introduce Minstrel, a multi-generative agent system with reflection to automate the generation of structural prompts. Experiments and the case study illustrate that structural prompts generated by Minstrel or written manually significantly enhance the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the ease of use of structural prompts through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.16929</p></details> |

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

| **[What You Say = What You Want? Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Robot Failure Recovery Using Vision-Language Models With Optimized Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03966v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robot autonomy struggles to operate beyond the assumed Operational Design Domain (ODD), the specific set of conditions and environments in which the system is designed to function, while the real-world is rife with uncertainties that may lead to failures. Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |

Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%.

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a Conference Paper at COLM 2024; 10 Pages; https://github.com/jnwilliams/FUSE_prompt_inversion.git</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Base Station Siting: Intelligent Deployment based on Prompt or Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03631v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing and user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in communication, networking, and optimization. As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Dialogue State Tracking via Dual Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21633v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) seeks to enable dialogue systems to transition to unfamiliar domains without manual annotation or extensive retraining. Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

We introduce a novel optimization algorithm that leverages our language models to optimize molecules for arbitrary properties given limited access to a black box oracle. Our approach combines ideas from genetic algorithms, rejection sampling, and prompt optimization. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple molecular optimization benchmarks, including an 8% improvement on Practical Molecular Optimization compared to previous methods. We publicly release the training corpus, the language models and the optimization algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16370v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate the performance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

We worked with the domain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and effective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a human-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset collection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By enhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool for HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks.

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |

Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |

Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

| **[$\textit{LinkPrompt}$: Natural and Universal Adversarial Attacks on Prompt-based Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16432v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks, which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

| **[Dynamic Prompt Optimizing for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04095v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generative models, specifically those based on diffusion models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion, have made substantial advancements. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

| **[Automatic Prompt Selection for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02717v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform various natural language processing tasks with suitable instruction prompts. However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alpaca against Vicuna: Using LLMs to Uncover Memorization of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04801v2)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a black-box prompt optimization method that uses an attacker LLM agent to uncover higher levels of memorization in a victim agent, compared to what is revealed by prompting the target model with the training data directly, which is the dominant approach of quantifying memorization in LLMs. We use an iterative rejection-sampling optimization process to find instruction-based prompts with two main characteristics: (1) minimal overlap with the training data to avoid presenting the solution directly to the model, and (2) maximal overlap between the victim model's output and the training data, aiming to induce the victim to spit out training data. We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

| **[Facilitating Human Feedback for GenAI Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15304v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the optimization of Generative AI (GenAI) systems through human feedback, focusing on how varying feedback mechanisms influence the quality of GenAI outputs. We devised a Human-AI training loop where 32 students, divided into two groups, evaluated AI-generated responses based on a single prompt. One group assessed a single output, while the other compared two outputs. Preliminary results from this small-scale experiment suggest that comparative feedback might encourage more nuanced evaluations, highlighting the potential for improved human-AI collaboration in prompt optimization. Future research with larger samples is recommended to validate these findings and further explore effective feedback strategies for GenAI systems.</p></details> | 2 pages |
| **[PLOT-TAL -- Prompt Learning with Optimal Transport for Few-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18915v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach to temporal action localization (TAL) in few-shot learning. Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossTune: Black-Box Few-Shot Classification with Label Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12468v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training or finetuning large-scale language models (LLMs) requires substantial computation resources, motivating recent efforts to explore parameter-efficient adaptation to downstream tasks. One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts. The project code is available at https://vlislab22.github.io/BrightDreamer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Multi-Role Capabilities of Large Language Models for Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05217v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has emerged as a pivotal research spotlight in information systems. Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |
| **[ConstitutionalExperts: Training a Mixture of Principle-based Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04894v1)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable at a variety of tasks given the right prompt, but writing one is still a difficult and tedious process. In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12760v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-designed prompts have demonstrated the potential to guide text-to-image models in generating amazing images. Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |
