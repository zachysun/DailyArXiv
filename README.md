| **[PMM-Net: Single-stage Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction with Patching-based Embedding and Explicit Modal Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19544v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and forecasting trajectories of agents like pedestrians plays a pivotal role for embodied intelligent applications. The inherent indeterminacy of human behavior and complex social interaction among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than common time-series forecasting. In this letter, we aim to explore a distinct formulation for multi-agent trajectory prediction framework. Specifically, we proposed a patching-based temporal feature extraction module and a graph-based social feature extraction module, enabling effective feature extraction and cross-scenario generalization. Moreover, we reassess the role of social interaction and present a novel method based on explicit modality modulation to integrate temporal and social features, thereby constructing an efficient single-stage inference pipeline. Results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Utilizing Image Transforms and Diffusion Models for Generative Modeling of Short and Long Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19538v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lately, there has been a surge in interest surrounding generative modeling of time series data. Most existing approaches are designed either to process short sequences or to handle long-range sequences. This dichotomy can be attributed to gradient issues with recurrent networks, computational costs associated with transformers, and limited expressiveness of state space models. Towards a unified generative model for varying-length time series, we propose in this work to transform sequences into images. By employing invertible transforms such as the delay embedding and the short-time Fourier transform, we unlock three main advantages: i) We can exploit advanced diffusion vision models; ii) We can remarkably process short- and long-range inputs within the same framework; and iii) We can harness recent and established tools proposed in the time series to image literature. We validate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks, including unconditional generation, interpolation, and extrapolation. We show that our approach achieves consistently state-of-the-art results against strong baselines. In the unconditional generation tasks, we show remarkable mean improvements of 58.17% over previous diffusion models in the short discriminative score and 132.61% in the (ultra-)long classification scores.

| **[Beyond Conformal Predictors: Adaptive Conformal Inference with Confidence Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15548v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction (CP) is a robust framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification, but it requires exchangeable data to ensure valid prediction sets at a user-specified significance level. When this assumption is violated, as in time-series or other structured data, the validity guarantees of CP no longer hold. Adaptive conformal inference (ACI) was introduced to address this limitation by adjusting the significance level dynamically, ensuring finite-sample coverage guarantees even for non-exchangeable data. In this paper, we show that ACI does not require the use of conformal predictors; instead, it can be implemented with the more general confidence predictors, which are computationally simpler and still maintain the crucial property of nested prediction sets. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that confidence predictors can perform comparably to, or even better than, conformal predictors, particularly in terms of computational efficiency. These findings suggest that confidence predictors represent a viable and efficient alternative to conformal predictors in non-exchangeable data settings, although further studies are needed to identify when one method is superior.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 5 figures.

| **[LOCAL: Learning with Orientation Matrix to Infer Causal Structure from Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19464v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering the underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from time series observational data is highly challenging due to the dynamic nature and complex nonlinear interactions between variables. Existing methods often struggle with inefficiency and the handling of high-dimensional data. To address these research gap, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. On this basis, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing the algebraic characterization of acyclicity with new capabilities: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML generates causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring the creation of DAGs while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing the dynamic causal structure of high-dimensional data and enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods, and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery. Our code will be available soon.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Variational Schr√∂dinger Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04795v4)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward score functions, inevitably resulting in the costly implicit training loss based on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore simulation-free properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schr\"odinger diffusion model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically, we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no longer depends on warm-up initializations and has become tuning-friendly in training large-scale experiments.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[MC-QDSNN: Quantized Deep evolutionary SNN with Multi-Dendritic Compartment Neurons for Stress Detection using Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04992v3)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Robust Time Series Causal Discovery for Agent-Based Model Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19412v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-Based Model (ABM) validation is crucial as it helps ensuring the reliability of simulations, and causal discovery has become a powerful tool in this context. However, current causal discovery methods often face accuracy and robustness challenges when applied to complex and noisy time series data, which is typical in ABM scenarios. This study addresses these issues by proposing a Robust Cross-Validation (RCV) approach to enhance causal structure learning for ABM validation. We develop RCV-VarLiNGAM and RCV-PCMCI, novel extensions of two prominent causal discovery algorithms. These aim to reduce the impact of noise better and give more reliable causal relation results, even with high-dimensional, time-dependent data. The proposed approach is then integrated into an enhanced ABM validation framework, which is designed to handle diverse data and model structures. The approach is evaluated using synthetic datasets and a complex simulated fMRI dataset. The results demonstrate greater reliability in causal structure identification. The study examines how various characteristics of datasets affect the performance of established causal discovery methods. These characteristics include linearity, noise distribution, stationarity, and causal structure density. This analysis is then extended to the RCV method to see how it compares in these different situations. This examination helps confirm whether the results are consistent with existing literature and also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the novel approaches. By tackling key methodological challenges, the study aims to enhance ABM validation with a more resilient valuation framework presented. These improvements increase the reliability of model-driven decision making processes in complex systems analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable challenge stems from the influence of communication channel conditions on their performance. In this work, we introduce COMSPLIT: a novel communication-aware design for split learning (SL) and inference paradigm tailored to processing time series data in IoT networks. COMSPLIT provides a versatile framework for deploying adaptable SL in IoT networks affected by diverse channel conditions. In conjunction with the integration of an early-exit strategy, and addressing IoT scenarios containing devices with heterogeneous computational capabilities, COMSPLIT represents a comprehensive design solution for communication-aware SL in IoT networks. Numerical results show superior performance of COMSPLIT compared to vanilla SL approaches (that assume ideal communication channel), demonstrating its ability to offer both design simplicity and adaptability to different channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[A Stock Price Prediction Approach Based on Time Series Decomposition and Multi-Scale CNN using OHLCT Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19291v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment, which together make price movements complex and difficult to predict. Despite many studies aimed at enhancing stock price prediction models, challenges such as data noise, model overfitting, and lack of interpretability are still encountered. To address these issues and improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a novel method, named Sequence-based Multiscale Fusion Regression Convolutional Neural Network (SMSFR-CNN), for predicting stock price movements in the China A-share market. By utilizing CNN to learn sequential features and combining them with image features, we improve the accuracy of stock trend prediction on the A-share market stock dataset. This approach reduces the search space for image features, stabilizes, and accelerates the training process. Extensive comparative experiments on 4,454 A-share stocks show that the proposed model achieves 61.15% for positive predictive value and 63.37% for negative predictive value of the stock price trend over the next 5 days, resulting in a total profit of 165.09%.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[TEAM: Topological Evolution-aware Framework for Traffic Forecasting--Extended Version](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19192v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the global trend towards urbanization, people increasingly move to and live in cities that then continue to grow. Traffic forecasting plays an important role in the intelligent transportation systems of cities as well as in spatio-temporal data mining. State-of-the-art forecasting is achieved by deep-learning approaches due to their ability to contend with complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, existing methods assume the input is fixed-topology road networks and static traffic time series. These assumptions fail to align with urbanization, where time series are collected continuously and road networks evolve over time. In such settings, deep-learning models require frequent re-initialization and re-training, imposing high computational costs. To enable much more efficient training without jeopardizing model accuracy, we propose the Topological Evolution-aware Framework (TEAM) for traffic forecasting that incorporates convolution and attention. This combination of mechanisms enables better adaptation to newly collected time series, while being able to maintain learned knowledge from old time series. TEAM features a continual learning module based on the Wasserstein metric that acts as a buffer that can identify the most stable and the most changing network nodes. Then, only data related to stable nodes is employed for re-training when consolidating a model. Further, only data of new nodes and their adjacent nodes as well as data pertaining to changing nodes are used to re-train the model. Empirical studies with two real-world traffic datasets offer evidence that TEAM is capable of much lower re-training costs than existing methods are, without jeopardizing forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

| **[Wildfire Risk Prediction: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v4)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires have significant impacts on global vegetation, wildlife, and humans. They destroy plant communities and wildlife habitats and contribute to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, and other pollutants. The prediction of wildfires relies on various independent variables combined with regression or machine learning methods. In this technical review, we describe the options for independent variables, data processing techniques, models, independent variables collinearity and importance estimation methods, and model performance evaluation metrics. First, we divide the independent variables into 4 aspects, including climate and meteorology conditions, socio-economical factors, terrain and hydrological features, and wildfire historical records. Second, preprocessing methods are described for different magnitudes, different spatial-temporal resolutions, and different formats of data. Third, the collinearity and importance evaluation methods of independent variables are also considered. Fourth, we discuss the application of statistical models, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in wildfire risk prediction. In this subsection, compared with other reviews, this manuscript particularly discusses the evaluation metrics and recent advancements in deep learning methods. Lastly, addressing the limitations of current research, this paper emphasizes the need for more effective deep learning time series forecasting algorithms, the utilization of three-dimensional data including ground and trunk fuel, extraction of more accurate historical fire point data, and improved model evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is a critical task in decision making across various domains. While numerical data provides a foundation, it often lacks crucial context necessary for accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge or constraints, which can be efficiently communicated through natural language. However, the ability of existing forecasting models to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. By presenting this benchmark, we aim to advance multimodal forecasting, promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review.

| **[Data Augmentation of Multivariate Sensor Time Series using Autoregressive Models and Application to Failure Prognostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16419v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel data augmentation solution for non-stationary multivariate time series and its application to failure prognostics. The method extends previous work from the authors which is based on time-varying autoregressive processes. It can be employed to extract key information from a limited number of samples and generate new synthetic samples in a way that potentially improves the performance of PHM solutions. This is especially valuable in situations of data scarcity which are very usual in PHM, especially for failure prognostics. The proposed approach is tested based on the CMAPSS dataset, commonly employed for prognostics experiments and benchmarks. An AutoML approach from PHM literature is employed for automating the design of the prognostics solution. The empirical evaluation provides evidence that the proposed method can substantially improve the performance of PHM solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>PREPR...</summary><p>PREPRINT of paper to appear at 2024 Conference of PHM Society</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18712v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While time series diffusion models have received considerable focus from many recent works, the performance of existing models remains highly unstable. Factors limiting time series diffusion models include insufficient time series datasets and the absence of guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval- Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD). The framework of RATD consists of two parts: an embedding-based retrieval process and a reference-guided diffusion model. In the first part, RATD retrieves the time series that are most relevant to historical time series from the database as references. The references are utilized to guide the denoising process in the second part. Our approach allows leveraging meaningful samples within the database to aid in sampling, thus maximizing the utilization of datasets. Meanwhile, this reference-guided mechanism also compensates for the deficiencies of existing time series diffusion models in terms of guidance. Experiments and visualizations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in complicated prediction tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Large Language Models for Financial Aid in Financial Time-series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19025v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considering the difficulty of financial time series forecasting in financial aid, much of the current research focuses on leveraging big data analytics in financial services. One modern approach is to utilize "predictive analysis", analogous to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as the backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal ("few-shot") or no fine-tuning ("zero-shot"). Our benchmark study, which includes financial aid with seven other time series tasks, shows the potential of using LLMs for scarce financial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub link https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Financial-Time-Series</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs with Semantic Space Alignment for Enhanced Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18686v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention and introduced novel perspectives in time series classification. However, existing approaches often overlook the crucial dynamic temporal information inherent in time series data and face challenges in aligning this data with textual semantics. To address these limitations, we propose HiTime, a hierarchical multi-modal model that seamlessly integrates temporal information into LLMs for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Our model employs a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data through both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. To facilitate semantic space alignment between time series and text, we introduce a dual-view contrastive alignment module that bridges the gap between modalities. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid prompting strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained LLM in a parameter-efficient manner. By effectively incorporating dynamic temporal features and ensuring semantic alignment, HiTime enables LLMs to process continuous time series data and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance through text generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiTime significantly enhances time series classification accuracy compared to most competitive baseline methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating temporal features into LLMs, paving the way for advanced time series analysis. The code is publicly available for further research and validation. Our codes are publicly available1.</p></details> |  |

However, in the tourism industry, time series data often exhibit a leading time property, presenting a 2D structure. This introduces unique challenges for forecasting in this sector. In this study, we propose a novel modelling paradigm, TripCast, which treats trip time series as 2D data and learns representations through masking and reconstruction processes. Pre-trained on large-scale real-world data, TripCast notably outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in in-domain forecasting scenarios and demonstrates strong scalability and transferability in out-domain forecasting scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Graph Attention Neural Network Performance for Marijuana Consumption Classification through Large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) Analysis of Functional MR Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18506v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present research, the effectiveness of large-scale Augmented Granger Causality (lsAGC) as a tool for gauging brain network connectivity was examined to differentiate between marijuana users and typical controls by utilizing resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data of its decomposed trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting. The source code is available at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/FDF.</p></details> |  |
| **[System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optical next generation reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for realizations in physical systems. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC based on scattering media, while achieving better forecasting performance. Our optical NGRC framework may inspire the realization of NGRC in other physical RC systems, new applications beyond time-series processing, and the development of deep and parallel architectures broadly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting X-formers with Structured Matrix for Long Sequence Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12462v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models for long sequence time series forecasting problems have gained significant attention due to their exceptional forecasting precision. However, the self-attention mechanism introduces challenges in terms of computational efficiency due to its quadratic time complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). They replace the self-attention and feed-forward layer by leveraging structured matrices that reduce both time and space complexity while maintaining the expressive power of the original self-attention mechanism and feed-forward network. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments on nine Transformer variants across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 9.45%, alongside a 46% reduction in model size.

Despite recent deep learning advancements, increased model complexity, and larger model sizes, many state-of-the-art models often perform worse or on par with simpler models. One of those cases is a recently proposed model, FITS, claiming competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter counts. By training a one-layer neural network in the complex frequency domain, we are able to replicate these results. Our experiments on a wide range of real-world datasets further reveal that FITS especially excels at capturing periodic and seasonal patterns, but struggles with trending, non-periodic, or random-resembling behavior. With our two novel hybrid approaches, where we attempt to remedy the weaknesses of FITS by combining it with DLinear, we achieve the best results of any known open-source model on multivariate regression and promising results in multiple/linear regression on price datasets, on top of vastly improving upon what FITS achieves as a standalone model.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv:2307.03756v3 45 pages, 36 figures</p></details> |

| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, the project can be found at https://github.com/RafaDD/CondTSF</p></details> |

After World War II, the Federal Republic of Germany was formed in 1949. Since then every plenary session of the German Bundestag was logged and even has been digitized over the course of the last few years. We analyze these texts using a time series variant of the topic model LDA to investigate which events had a lasting effect on the political discourse and how the political topics changed over time. This allows us to detect changes in word frequency (and thus key discussion points) in political discourse.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

We rely on an architecture called Barlow Twins, borrowed from an understanding of the human visual cortical system and originally envisioned for the image domain and adapt it for learning path invariance in seismic event time series. Our model improves the performance on event characterization tasks such as source discrimination across catalogs by 10-12% and provides more reliable predictive uncertainty estimates. We suggest that dataset scale and diversity more than architecture may determine aspects of the current ceiling on performance. We leverage decision trees, linear models, and visualization to understanding the dependencies in learned representations.</p></details> |  |

However, in a temporal setting, multi-modal data are often inherently asynchronous. EHR can be continuously collected but CXR is generally taken with a much longer interval due to its high cost and radiation dose. When clinical prediction is needed, the last available CXR image might have been outdated, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this challenge, we propose DDL-CXR, a method that dynamically generates an up-to-date latent representation of the individualized CXR images. Our approach leverages latent diffusion models for patient-specific generation strategically conditioned on a previous CXR image and EHR time series, providing information regarding anatomical structures and disease progressions, respectively. In this way, the interaction across modalities could be better captured by the latent CXR generation process, ultimately improving the prediction performance. Experiments using MIMIC datasets show that the proposed model could effectively address asynchronicity in multimodal fusion and consistently outperform existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS-24</p></details> |

Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for time series anomaly prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>Senso...</summary><p>Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</p></details> |

By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code can be found at: https://github.com/RoelBouman/StormPhase2</p></details> |

Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

Most existing methods manually build specific CL Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually requires excessive prior knowledge about the data, and massive experiments to determine the detailed CL configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns CLS for time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled search space of size over $3\times10^{12}$, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction, and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for the given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guide for the future design of CLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024. Fixed typos</p></details> |

Capturing patterns both within and between temporal and multivariate components is crucial for reliable predictions. We introduce xLSTM-Mixer, a model designed to effectively integrate temporal sequences, joint time-variate information, and multiple perspectives for robust forecasting. Our approach begins with a linear forecast shared across variates, which is then refined by xLSTM blocks. These blocks serve as key elements for modeling the complex dynamics of challenging time series data. xLSTM-Mixer ultimately reconciles two distinct views to produce the final forecast. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate xLSTM-Mixer's superior long-term forecasting performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. A thorough model analysis provides further insights into its key components and confirms its robustness and effectiveness. This work contributes to the resurgence of recurrent models in time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical forecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques, ignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that incorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both the intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the fluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use time series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range prediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility components, our model is more interpretable.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Current methods can only detect COPD from prominent features in spirogram (Volume-Flow time series) but cannot predict future COPD risk from subtle data patterns. We propose a deep learning-based method, DeepSpiro, for early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four key components: SpiroSmoother for stabilizing the Volume-Flow curve, SpiroEncoder for capturing volume evolution through key patches of varying lengths, SpiroExplainer for integrating heterogeneous data and explaining predictions through volume attention, and SpiroPredictor for predicting the disease risk of undiagnosed high-risk patients based on key patch concavity, with prediction horizons of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or even longer. Evaluated on the UK Biobank dataset, DeepSpiro achieved an AUC of 0.8328 for COPD detection and demonstrated strong predictive performance for future COPD risk (p-value < 0.001). DeepSpiro effectively predicts the long-term progression of the disease.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, existing approaches rely solely on time-domain features ignoring frequency components providing complementary information. This paper proposes Time Frequency Domain Adaptation (TFDA), a method to cope with the source-free time-series domain adaptation problems. TFDA is developed with a dual branch network structure fully utilizing both time and frequency features in delivering final predictions. It induces pseudo-labels based on a neighborhood concept where predictions of a sample group are aggregated to generate reliable pseudo labels. The concept of contrastive learning is carried out in both time and frequency domains with pseudo label information and a negative pair exclusion strategy to make valid neighborhood assumptions. In addition, the time-frequency consistency technique is proposed using the self-distillation strategy while the uncertainty reduction strategy is implemented to alleviate uncertainties due to the domain shift problem. Last but not least, the curriculum learning strategy is integrated to combat noisy pseudo labels. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of our approach over prior arts with noticeable margins in benchmark problems.</p></details> |  |

High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |
| **[Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocate the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocity of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</p></details> |  |

Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight. Results show that using these evolved RNNs and a simple daily long-short strategy can generate higher returns than both the DJI index and the S&P 500 Index for both 2022 (bear market) and 2023 (bull market).</p></details> |  |
| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> |  |

The data collected using this equipment can be used clinical staff to gain insight into the condition of the patients and provide adequate treatment, but it also provides ample opportunity for applications in machine learning and data science. While this data can frequently be used directly, complex problems may require additional annotations to provide context and meaning before it could be used to train the machine learning models. Annotating time-series datasets in clinical setting is a complex problem due to a large volume and complexity of the data, time-consuming nature of the process and the fact that clinicians' time is in both high demand and short supply. In this study, we present an evaluation of a bespoke tool designed to annotate large, clinical time-series datasets with staff from intensive care units. The software incorporates two modes for annotation: by annotating individual admissions and by generating rulesets which are applied to the entire dataset. Our study was split into two stages focusing on individual and semi-automated annotation and included 28 annotators across both stages who utilised 50 clinical parameters to guide their annotations. We experienced significant challenges in recruitment and engagement of the participants in the annotation activities and developed interventions which improved the participation over the course of the study. During the semi-automated annotation, we observed preferences for different parameter types (measured vs. observed), as well as relative agreement of participants across shared admissions to the decision-tree model trained using their rulesets.</p></details> |  |

One way of capturing causal relationships is by utilizing Bayesian networks. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph, in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model, which is utilized in the present contribution to formulate a score-based learning approach. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut ("lazy constraint") method. Comparing the novel approach to the state of the art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce excellent results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances of up to 25 time-series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bio-science and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the opportunities in developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle modest instances.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Despite the widespread utilization of forecasting methods, there is a dearth of research aimed at comprehending the conditions under which these methods yield favorable or unfavorable performances. Empirical studies, although common, are challenged by the limited availability of time series datasets, restricting the extraction of reliable insights. To address this limitation, we present tsMorph, a tool for generating semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. tsMorph works by creating a sequence of datasets from two original datasets. The characteristics of the generated datasets progressively depart from those of one of the datasets and converge toward the attributes of the other dataset. This method provides a valuable alternative for obtaining substantial datasets. In this paper, we show the benefits of tsMorph by assessing the predictive performance of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and DeepAR forecasting algorithms. The time series used for the experiments comes from the NN5 Competition. The experimental results provide important insights. Notably, the performances of the two algorithms improve proportionally with the frequency of the time series. These experiments confirm that tsMorph can be an effective tool for better understanding the behavior of forecasting algorithms, delivering a pathway to overcoming the limitations posed by empirical studies and enabling more extensive and reliable experiments.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental challenge in science and engineering is to determine the governing equations of a complex system from snapshot data. Traditional equation discovery methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as the availability of the trajectory information or time-series data, and the presumption that the underlying system is deterministic. In this work, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-free framework, called Sparse Identification of Differential Equations from Snapshots (SpIDES), that discovers the governing equations of a complex system from snapshots by utilizing the advanced machine learning techniques to perform three essential steps: probability flow reconstruction, probability density estimation, and Bayesian sparse identification. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of SpIDES by successfully identifying the governing equation of an over-damped Langevin system confined within two potential wells. By extracting interpretable drift and diffusion terms from the SDEs, our framework provides deeper insights into system dynamics, enhances predictive accuracy, and facilitates more effective strategies for managing and simulating stochastic systems.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{S}$tochastic $\textbf{S}$parse $\textbf{S}$ampling (SSS), a novel VTSC framework developed for medical time series. SSS manages variable-length sequences by sparsely sampling fixed windows to compute local predictions, which are then aggregated and calibrated to form a global prediction. We apply SSS to the task of seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, a critical VTSC problem requiring identification of seizure-inducing brain regions from variable-length electrophysiological time series. We evaluate our method on the Epilepsy iEEG Multicenter Dataset, a heterogeneous collection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings obtained from four independent medical centers. SSS demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across most medical centers, and superior performance on all out-of-distribution (OOD) unseen medical centers. Additionally, SSS naturally provides post-hoc insights into local signal characteristics related to the SOZ, by visualizing temporally averaged local predictions throughout the signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are uGLAD? Time will tell!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11647v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We frequently encounter multiple series that are temporally correlated in our surroundings, such as EEG data to examine alterations in brain activity or sensors to monitor body movements. Segmentation of multivariate time series data is a technique for identifying meaningful patterns or changes in the time series that can signal a shift in the system's behavior. However, most segmentation algorithms have been designed primarily for univariate time series, and their performance on multivariate data remains largely unsatisfactory, making this a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for multivariate time series segmentation using conditional independence (CI) graphs. CI graphs are probabilistic graphical models that represents the partial correlations between the nodes. We propose a domain agnostic multivariate segmentation framework $\texttt{tGLAD}$ which draws a parallel between the CI graph nodes and the variables of the time series. Consider applying a graph recovery model $\texttt{uGLAD}$ to a short interval of the time series, it will result in a CI graph that shows partial correlations among the variables. We extend this idea to the entire time series by utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run a single $\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the CI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI graphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based trajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across distinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a suitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides a competitive time complexity of $O(N)$ for settings where number of variables $D<<N$. We demonstrate successful empirical results on a Physical Activity Monitoring data.</p></details> |  |
| **[QIXAI: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Enhancing Classical and Quantum Model Transparency and Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16537v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive performance of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is often hindered by their lack of interpretability, rendering them "black boxes." This opacity raises concerns in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, where trust and accountability are crucial. This paper introduces the QIXAI Framework (Quantum-Inspired Explainable AI), a novel approach for enhancing neural network interpretability through quantum-inspired techniques. By utilizing principles from quantum mechanics, such as Hilbert spaces, superposition, entanglement, and eigenvalue decomposition, the QIXAI framework reveals how different layers of neural networks process and combine features to make decisions. We critically assess model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME, as well as techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), highlighting their limitations in providing a comprehensive view of neural network operations. The QIXAI framework overcomes these limitations by offering deeper insights into feature importance, inter-layer dependencies, and information propagation. A CNN for malaria parasite detection is used as a case study to demonstrate how quantum-inspired methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mutual Information (MI) provide interpretable explanations of model behavior. Additionally, we explore the extension of QIXAI to other architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, and its application to generative models and time-series analysis. The framework applies to both quantum and classical systems, demonstrating its potential to improve interpretability and transparency across a range of models, advancing the broader goal of developing trustworthy AI systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Forecasts are useful to state government agencies to properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses effectively. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of EMS opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for each month. A variety of additional covariates were tested to determine their impact on the model's performance. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to optimize training time and accuracy. Our results show that when special precautions are taken to address data sparsity, useful predictions can be generated with limited error by utilizing yearly trends and covariance with additional data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-TS Integrator: Integrating LLM for Enhanced Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16489v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series~(TS) modeling is essential in dynamic systems like weather prediction and anomaly detection. Recent studies utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for TS modeling, leveraging their powerful pattern recognition capabilities. These methods primarily position LLMs as the predictive backbone, often omitting the mathematical modeling within traditional TS models, such as periodicity. However, disregarding the potential of LLMs also overlooks their pattern recognition capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce \textit{LLM-TS Integrator}, a novel framework that effectively integrates the capabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration is our \textit{mutual information} module. The core of this \textit{mutual information} module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived insights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS representations and LLM's textual representation counterparts, bridging the two modalities. Moreover, we recognize that samples vary in importance for two losses: traditional prediction and mutual information maximization. To address this variability, we introduce the \textit{sample reweighting} module to improve information utilization. This module assigns dual weights to each sample: one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss, dynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance across five mainstream TS tasks, including short-term and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

The outbreak of such diseases can pose a significant threat to human health. However, early detection and tracking of these outbreaks have the potential to reduce the mortality impact. To address these threats, public health authorities have endeavored to establish comprehensive mechanisms for collecting disease data. Many countries have implemented infectious disease surveillance systems, with the detection of epidemics being a primary objective. The clinical healthcare system, local/state health agencies, federal agencies, academic/professional groups, and collaborating governmental entities all play pivotal roles within this system. Moreover, nowadays, search engines and social media platforms can serve as valuable tools for monitoring disease trends. The Internet and social media have become significant platforms where users share information about their preferences and relationships. This real-time information can be harnessed to gauge the influence of ideas and societal opinions, making it highly useful across various domains and research areas, such as marketing campaigns, financial predictions, and public health, among others. This article provides a review of the existing standard methods developed by researchers for detecting outbreaks using time series data. These methods leverage various data sources, including conventional data sources and social media data or Internet data sources. The review particularly concentrates on works published within the timeframe of 2015 to 2022.</p></details> | 40 pages, 2 figures |

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

Despite some progress, research on predicting future anomalies is still relatively scarce. Predicting anomalies is particularly challenging due to the diverse reaction time and the lack of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRC to integrate reconstructive and contrastive learning for joint learning of anomaly prediction and detection, with multi-scale structure and adaptive dominant period mask to deal with the diverse reaction time. MultiRC also generates negative samples to provide essential training momentum for the anomaly prediction tasks and prevent model degradation. We evaluate seven benchmark datasets from different fields. For both anomaly prediction and detection tasks, MultiRC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In particular, this method can be used to estimate the state of a dynamical system from observational data gathered by sensors. However, when the number of observations are limited, DEIM returns large estimation errors. Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) was recently developed to address this problem by introducing a kernel vector which previous DEIM-based methods had ignored. Unfortunately, estimating the optimal kernel vector in S-DEIM is a difficult task. Here, we introduce a data-driven method to estimate this kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this machine learning approach together with S-DEIM leads to nearly optimal state estimations.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-ACL: A Time Series Analytic Continual Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Class-Incremental Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental Learning (CIL) in Time Series Classification (TSC) aims to incrementally train models using the streaming time series data that arrives continuously. The main problem in this scenario is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., training models with new samples inevitably leads to the forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Among existing methods, the replay-based methods achieve satisfactory performance but compromise privacy, while exemplar-free methods protect privacy but suffer from low accuracy. However, more critically, owing to their reliance on gradient-based update techniques, these existing methods fundamentally cannot solve the catastrophic forgetting problem. In TSC scenarios with continuously arriving data and temporally shifting distributions, these methods become even less practical. In this paper, we propose a Time Series Analytic Continual Learning framework, called TS-ACL. Inspired by analytical learning, TS-ACL transforms neural network updates into gradient-free linear regression problems, thereby fundamentally mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, employing a pre-trained and frozen feature extraction encoder, TS-ACL only needs to update its analytic classifier recursively in a lightweight manner that is highly suitable for real-time applications and large-scale data processing. Additionally, we theoretically demonstrate that the model obtained recursively through the TS-ACL is exactly equivalent to a model trained on the complete dataset in a centralized manner, thereby establishing the property of absolute knowledge memory. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our TS-ACL.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This narrow focus may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios. While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks, especially regarding essential forecasting needs like point and distributional forecasts across short and long horizons, is still lacking. In this paper, we present ProbTS, a benchmark tool designed as a unified platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of numerous cutting-edge studies from recent years. We dissect the distinctive data characteristics arising from disparate forecasting requirements and elucidate how these characteristics can skew methodological preferences in typical research trajectories, which often fail to fully accommodate essential forecasting needs. Building on this, we examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that our analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models. Finally, we outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble methods do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a clean and neat set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed method works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and does not require parameter tuning under the most common setting. Through rigorous computational experiments, we offer statistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other rule extraction methods and effectively handles time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>- Fix...</summary><p>- Fixed several typos - Related work have been expanded - Discussion of computational results has been improved for clearness</p></details> |

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce TimeDRL, a framework for multivariate time-series representation learning with dual-level disentangled embeddings. TimeDRL features: (i) disentangled timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for representation learning; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases. Experiments on forecasting and classification datasets show TimeDRL outperforms existing methods, with further validation in semi-supervised settings with limited labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been withdrawn to avoid duplication with a full version of the paper that is already available in another arXiv entry (arXiv:2410.12606).

It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.</p></details> |  |

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which underline feature or temporal importance, often require expert knowledge. In contrast, natural language explanations (NLEs) are more accessible to laypeople. However, evaluating forecast NLEs is difficult due to the complex causal relationships in time series data. To address this, we introduce two new performance metrics based on simulatability, assessing how well a human surrogate can predict model forecasts using the explanations. Experiments show these metrics differentiate good from poor explanations and align with human judgments. Utilizing these metrics, we further evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for time series data, finding that numerical reasoning, rather than model size, is the main factor influencing explanation quality.</p></details> |  |

Yet, ITS often relies on data from traffic sensors or vehicle devices, where certain cities might not have all those smart devices or enabling infrastructures. Also, recent studies have employed meta-learning to generalize spatial-temporal traffic networks, utilizing data from multiple cities for effective traffic forecasting for data-scarce target cities. However, collecting data from multiple cities can be costly and time-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Single Source Meta-Transfer Learning (SSMT) which relies only on a single source city for traffic prediction. Our method harnesses this transferred knowledge to enable few-shot traffic forecasting, particularly when the target city possesses limited data. Specifically, we use memory-augmented attention to store the heterogeneous spatial knowledge from the source city and selectively recall them for the data-scarce target city. We extend the idea of sinusoidal positional encoding to establish meta-learning tasks by leveraging diverse temporal traffic patterns from the source city. Moreover, to capture a more generalized representation of the positions we introduced a meta-positional encoding that learns the most optimal representation of the temporal pattern across all the tasks. We experiment on five real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing methods in time series traffic prediction.</p></details> | ICPR 2024 |

Gasoline, as a critical fuel, significantly supports the nation's transportation sector. Accurate forecasting of gasoline consumption is essential for strategic resource management and environmental planning. This research introduces a novel approach to predicting monthly gasoline consumption using a hybrid Transformer-LSTM-CNN model, which integrates the strengths of Transformer networks, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This advanced architecture offers a superior alternative to conventional methods such as artificial neural networks and regression models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, the temporal memory of LSTMs, and the local pattern detection of CNNs, our hybrid model delivers improved prediction accuracy. Implemented using Python, the model provides precise future gasoline consumption forecasts and evaluates the environmental impact through the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines gasoline consumption trends from 2007 to 2021, which rose from 64.5 million liters per day in 2007 to 99.80 million liters per day in 2021. Our proposed model forecasts consumption levels up to 2031, offering a valuable tool for policymakers and energy analysts. The results highlight the superiority of this hybrid model in improving the accuracy of gasoline consumption forecasts, reinforcing the need for advanced machine learning techniques to optimize resource management and mitigate environmental risks in the energy sector.</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are related. The second differs in that identified sub-images similar to the reference image are further clustered before patches contours are determined by solving a traveling salesman problem. Both tasks are complex in that the exact number of similar sub-images is not known a priori. The main discussion of this paper is presentation of an acceleration mechanism for sub-image search that is based on a transformation of an image to multivariate time series along the RGB-channels and subsequent segmentation to reduce the 2D search space in the image. Two variations of the acceleration mechanism are compared to exhaustive search on diverse synthetic and real-world images. Quantitatively, proposed method results in solve time reductions of up to 2 orders of magnitude, while qualitatively delivering comparative visual results. Proposed method is neural network-free and does not use any image pre-processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, human analysis and labeling are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is advantageous to learn embeddings for moments in time series in an unsupervised way, which allows for good performance in classification or detection tasks after later minimal human labeling. In this paper, we propose dynamic contrastive learning (DynaCL), an unsupervised contrastive representation learning framework for time series that uses temporal adjacent steps to define positive pairs. DynaCL adopts N-pair loss to dynamically treat all samples in a batch as positive or negative pairs, enabling efficient training and addressing the challenges of complicated sampling of positives. We demonstrate that DynaCL embeds instances from time series into semantically meaningful clusters, which allows superior performance on downstream tasks on a variety of public time series datasets. Our findings also reveal that high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics do not guarantee that the representations are useful in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the last three years, hundreds of papers and over fifty new deep-learning models have been described for time series models. These mainly focus on the key aspect of time dependence, whereas in some scientific time series, the situation is more complex with multiple locations, each location having multiple observed and target time-dependent streams and multiple exogenous (known) properties that are either constant or time-dependent. Here, we analyze the hydrology time series using the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets on catchment rainfall and runoff. Together, these have up to 6 observed streams and up to 209 static parameters defined at each of about 8000 locations. This analysis is fully open source with a Jupyter Notebook running on Google Colab for both an LSTM-based analysis and the data engineering preprocessing. Our goal is to investigate the importance of exogenous data, which we look at using eight different choices on representative hydrology tasks. Increasing the exogenous information significantly improves the data representation, with the mean square error decreasing to 60% of its initial value in the largest dataset examined. We present the initial results of studies of other deep-learning neural network architectures where the approaches that can use the full observed and exogenous observations outperform less flexible methods, including Foundation models. Using the natural annual periodic exogenous time series produces the largest impact, but the static and other periodic exogenous streams are also important. Our analysis is intended to be valuable as an educational resource and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our approach involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on present data. When discrepancies arise between the forecasting and detection models, the forecasting model undergoes more substantial updates, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop, drawing upon principles of predictive coding, enables the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, improving accuracy by focusing on features that remain relevant despite changes in the underlying data. We validate our method on a variety of tasks such as seizure prediction in biomedical signal analysis and forecasting in dynamical systems, achieving a 40\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and a 10\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism that adapts to data distribution drift, Future-Guided Learning offers a promising avenue for advancing time-series forecasting with deep learning.</p></details> |  |

We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</p></details> |  |

| **[Automated Rewards via LLM-Generated Progress Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09187v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to automate reward engineering by leveraging their broad domain knowledge across various tasks. However, they often need many iterations of trial-and-error to generate effective reward functions. This process is costly because evaluating every sampled reward function requires completing the full policy optimization process for each function. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-driven reward generation framework that is able to produce state-of-the-art policies on the challenging Bi-DexHands benchmark with 20x fewer reward function samples than the prior state-of-the-art work. Our key insight is that we reduce the problem of generating task-specific rewards to the problem of coarsely estimating task progress. Our two-step solution leverages the task domain knowledge and the code synthesis abilities of LLMs to author progress functions that estimate task progress from a given state. Then, we use this notion of progress to discretize states, and generate count-based intrinsic rewards using the low-dimensional state space. We show that the combination of LLM-generated progress functions and count-based intrinsic rewards is essential for our performance gains, while alternatives such as generic hash-based counts or using progress directly as a reward function fall short.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[On Designing Effective RL Reward at Training Time for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15115v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models have been increasingly critical for improving the reasoning capability of LLMs. Existing research has shown that a well-trained reward model can substantially improve model performances at inference time via search. However, the potential of reward models during RL training time still remains largely under-explored. It is currently unclear whether these reward models can provide additional training signals to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in RL training that uses sparse success rewards, which verify the correctness of solutions. In this work, we evaluate popular reward models for RL training, including the Outcome-supervised Reward Model (ORM) and the Process-supervised Reward Model (PRM), and train a collection of LLMs for math problems using RL by combining these learned rewards with success rewards. Surprisingly, even though these learned reward models have strong inference-time performances, they may NOT help or even hurt RL training, producing worse performances than LLMs trained with the success reward only. Our analysis reveals that an LLM can receive high rewards from some of these reward models by repeating correct but unnecessary reasoning steps, leading to a severe reward hacking issue. Therefore, we introduce two novel reward refinement techniques, including Clipping and Delta. The key idea is to ensure the accumulative reward of any reasoning trajectory is upper-bounded to keep a learned reward model effective without being exploited. We evaluate our techniques with multiple reward models over a set of 1.5B and 7B LLMs on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks and demonstrate that with a carefully designed reward function, RL training without any additional supervised tuning can improve all the evaluated LLMs, including the state-of-the-art 7B LLM Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on MATH and GSM8K benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A primary agent was tasked with creating a blog about a fictional Danish artist named Flipfloppidy, which was then reviewed by another agent for factual inaccuracies. Most LLMs hallucinated the existence of this artist. Across 4,900 test runs involving various combinations of primary and reviewing agents, advanced AI models such as Llama3-70b and GPT-4 variants demonstrated near-perfect accuracy in identifying hallucinations and successfully revised outputs in 85% to 100% of cases following feedback. These findings underscore the potential of advanced AI models to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated content, providing a promising approach to improving AI workflow orchestration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Extreme Gradient Boost Rank-1 Adaption for Efficient Finetuning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19694v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. However, the enormous size of LLMs poses significant challenges in terms of computational complexity and resource requirements. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising solution. However, there exists a gap between the practical performance of low-rank adaptations and its theoretical optimum. In this work, we propose eXtreme Gradient Boosting LoRA (XGBLoRA), a novel framework that bridges this gap by leveraging the power of ensemble learning. Inspired by gradient boosting, XGBLoRA iteratively learns and merges a sequence of LoRA adaptations to refine model predictions. It achieves better performance than the standard LoRA, while enjoying the computational efficiency of rank-1 adaptations. We provide theoretical analysis to show the convergence and optimality of our approach, and conduct extensive experiments on a range of natural language processing tasks. The results demonstrate that XGBLoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly fewer trainable parameters. This work advances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for LLMs, and offers a promising solution for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks while optimizing performance and efficiency.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[AGENT-CQ: Automatic Generation and Evaluation of Clarifying Questions for Conversational Search with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19692v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating diverse and effective clarifying questions is crucial for improving query understanding and retrieval performance in open-domain conversational search (CS) systems. We propose AGENT-CQ (Automatic GENeration, and evaluaTion of Clarifying Questions), an end-to-end LLM-based framework addressing the challenges of scalability and adaptability faced by existing methods that rely on manual curation or template-based approaches. AGENT-CQ consists of two stages: a generation stage employing LLM prompting strategies to generate clarifying questions, and an evaluation stage (CrowdLLM) that simulates human crowdsourcing judgments using multiple LLM instances to assess generated questions and answers based on comprehensive quality metrics. Extensive experiments on the ClariQ dataset demonstrate CrowdLLM's effectiveness in evaluating question and answer quality. Human evaluation and CrowdLLM show that the AGENT-CQ - generation stage, consistently outperforms baselines in various aspects of question and answer quality. In retrieval-based evaluation, LLM-generated questions significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness for both BM25 and cross-encoder models compared to human-generated questions.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Towards Automated Penetration Testing: Introducing LLM Benchmark, Analysis, and Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17141v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hacking poses a significant threat to cybersecurity, inflicting billions of dollars in damages annually. To mitigate these risks, ethical hacking, or penetration testing, is employed to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential across various domains, including cybersecurity. However, there is currently no comprehensive, open, end-to-end automated penetration testing benchmark to drive progress and evaluate the capabilities of these models in security contexts. This paper introduces a novel open benchmark for LLM-based automated penetration testing, addressing this critical gap. We first evaluate the performance of LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama 3.1-405B, using the state-of-the-art PentestGPT tool. Our findings reveal that while Llama 3.1 demonstrates an edge over GPT-4o, both models currently fall short of performing fully automated, end-to-end penetration testing. Next, we advance the state-of-the-art and present ablation studies that provide insights into improving the PentestGPT tool. Our research illuminates the challenges LLMs face in each aspect of Pentesting, e.g. enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-assisted cybersecurity and lays the foundation for future research in automated penetration testing using large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Paper 1-9 pages, Supplementary Materials: 10-17, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[APRICOT: Active Preference Learning and Constraint-Aware Task Planning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19656v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Home robots performing personalized tasks must adeptly balance user preferences with environmental affordances. We focus on organization tasks within constrained spaces, such as arranging items into a refrigerator, where preferences for placement collide with physical limitations. The robot must infer user preferences based on a small set of demonstrations, which is easier for users to provide than extensively defining all their requirements. While recent works use Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn preferences from user demonstrations, they encounter two fundamental challenges. First, there is inherent ambiguity in interpreting user actions, as multiple preferences can often explain a single observed behavior. Second, not all user preferences are practically feasible due to geometric constraints in the environment. To address these challenges, we introduce APRICOT, a novel approach that merges LLM-based Bayesian active preference learning with constraint-aware task planning. APRICOT refines its generated preferences by actively querying the user and dynamically adapts its plan to respect environmental constraints. We evaluate APRICOT on a dataset of diverse organization tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showing significant improvements in both preference satisfaction and plan feasibility.

| **[$C^2$: Scalable Auto-Feedback for LLM-based Chart Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18652v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-quality charts with Large Language Models presents significant challenges due to limited data and the high cost of scaling through human curation. Instruction, data, and code triplets are scarce and expensive to manually curate as their creation demands technical expertise. To address this scalability issue, we introduce a reference-free automatic feedback generator, which eliminates the need for costly human intervention. Our novel framework, $C^2$, consists of (1) an automatic feedback provider (ChartAF) and (2) a diverse, reference-free dataset (ChartUIE-8K). Quantitative results are compelling: in our first experiment, 74% of respondents strongly preferred, and 10% preferred, the results after feedback. The second post-feedback experiment demonstrates that ChartAF outperforms nine baselines. Moreover, ChartUIE-8K significantly improves data diversity by increasing queries, datasets, and chart types by 5982%, 1936%, and 91%, respectively, over benchmarks. Finally, an LLM user study revealed that 94% of participants preferred ChartUIE-8K's queries, with 93% deeming them aligned with real-world use cases. Core contributions are available as open-source at an anonymized project site, with ample qualitative examples.</p></details> | Preprint |

The plugin collects the parts of proofs marked with the admit tactic in a Coq file, i.e., proof holes, and combines LLMs along with non-machine-learning methods to generate proof candidates for the holes. Then, CoqPilot checks if each proof candidate solves the given subgoal and, if successful, replaces the hole with it. The focus of CoqPilot is twofold. Firstly, we want to allow users to seamlessly combine multiple Coq generation approaches and provide a zero-setup experience for our tool. Secondly, we want to deliver a platform for LLM-based experiments on Coq proof generation. We developed a benchmarking system for Coq generation methods, available in the plugin, and conducted an experiment using it, showcasing the framework's possibilities.

| **[Take Caution in Using LLMs as Human Surrogates: Scylla Ex Machina](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19599v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Almost all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models, except in one case involving fine-tuning using a substantial amount of human behavior data. Causes of failure are diverse, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results caution against using LLMs to study human behaviors or as human surrogates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09450v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, research has predominantly focused on the effects of adjustments to the Federal Funds rate rather than on the decision-making process itself. Recent advancements in large language models(LLMs) offer a potential method for reconstructing the original FOMC meetings, which are responsible for setting the Federal Funds rate. In this paper, we propose a five-stage FOMC meeting simulation framework, MiniFed, which employs LLM agents to simulate real-world FOMC meeting members and optimize the FOMC structure. This framework effectively revitalizes the FOMC meeting process and facilitates projections of the Federal Funds rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MiniFed framework achieves both high accuracy in Federal Funds rate projections and behavioral alignment with the agents' real-world counterparts. Given that few studies have focused on employing LLM agents to simulate large-scale real-world conferences, our work can serve as a benchmark for future developments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Knowledge Selection Behaviours in LLMs via SAE-Based Representation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15999v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can store a significant amount of factual knowledge in their parameters. However, their parametric knowledge may conflict with the information provided in the context -- this phenomenon, known as \emph{context-memory knowledge conflicts}, can lead to undesirable model behaviour, such as reliance on outdated or incorrect information. Analysing the internal activations of LLMs, we find that they can internally register the signals of knowledge conflict at mid-layers. Such signals allow us to detect whether a knowledge conflict occurs and use \emph{inference-time} intervention strategies to resolve it. In this work, we propose \textsc{SpARE}, a \emph{training-free} representation engineering method that uses pre-trained sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) to control the knowledge selection behaviour of LLMs. \textsc{SpARE} identifies the functional features that control the knowledge selection behaviours and applies them to edit the internal activations of LLMs at inference time. Our experimental results show that \textsc{SpARE} can effectively control the usage of either knowledge source to resolve knowledge conflict in open-domain question-answering tasks, surpassing existing representation engineering methods ($+10\%$) as well as contrastive decoding methods ($+15\%$).</p></details> |  |
| **[ChunkRAG: Novel LLM-Chunk Filtering Method for RAG Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19572v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses due to the retrieval of irrelevant or loosely related information. Existing methods, which operate at the document level, fail to effectively filter out such content. We propose LLM-driven chunk filtering, ChunkRAG, a framework that enhances RAG systems by evaluating and filtering retrieved information at the chunk level. Our approach employs semantic chunking to divide documents into coherent sections and utilizes LLM-based relevance scoring to assess each chunk's alignment with the user's query. By filtering out less pertinent chunks before the generation phase, we significantly reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing RAG models, achieving higher accuracy on tasks requiring precise information retrieval. This advancement enhances the reliability of RAG systems, making them particularly beneficial for applications like fact-checking and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[StructRAG: Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08815v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a key means to effectively enhance large language models (LLMs) in many knowledge-based tasks. However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Debate-Driven Experiment on LLM Hallucinations and Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19485v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved a degree of success in generating coherent and contextually relevant text, yet they remain prone to a significant challenge known as hallucination: producing information that is not substantiated by the input or external knowledge. Previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations have focused on techniques such as fine-tuning models on high-quality datasets, incorporating fact-checking mechanisms, and developing adversarial training methods. While these approaches have shown some promise, they often address the issue at the level of individual model outputs, leaving unexplored the effects of inter-model interactions on hallucination. This study investigates the phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs through a novel experimental framework where multiple instances of GPT-4o-Mini models engage in a debate-like interaction prompted with questions from the TruthfulQA dataset. One model is deliberately instructed to generate plausible but false answers while the other models are asked to respond truthfully. The experiment is designed to assess whether the introduction of misinformation by one model can challenge the truthful majority to better justify their reasoning, improving performance on the TruthfulQA benchmark. The findings suggest that inter-model interactions can offer valuable insights into improving the accuracy and robustness of LLM outputs, complementing existing mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[An LLM Agent for Automatic Geospatial Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18792v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being used in data science code generation tasks, but they often struggle with complex sequential tasks, leading to logical errors. Their application to geospatial data processing is particularly challenging due to difficulties in incorporating complex data structures and spatial constraints, effectively utilizing diverse function calls, and the tendency to hallucinate less-used geospatial libraries. To tackle these problems, we introduce GeoAgent, a new interactive framework designed to help LLMs handle geospatial data processing more effectively. GeoAgent pioneers the integration of a code interpreter, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, offering a novel approach to geospatial data processing. In addition, we contribute a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the LLM-based approach in geospatial tasks. This benchmark leverages a variety of Python libraries and includes both single-turn and multi-turn tasks such as data acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. By offering a comprehensive evaluation among diverse geospatial contexts, this benchmark sets a new standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks. Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the proposed GeoAgent has demonstrated superior performance, yielding notable improvements in function calls and task completion. In addition, these results offer valuable insights for the future development of LLM agents in automatic geospatial data analysis task programming.</p></details> |  |

Despite these benefits, DPO and its variants remain sensitive to hyper-parameters and prone to instability, particularly on mathematical datasets. We argue that these issues arise from the unidirectional likelihood-derivative negative feedback inherent in the log-likelihood loss function. To address this, we propose a novel LLM alignment loss that establishes a stable Bidirectional Negative Feedback (BNF) during optimization. Our proposed BNF loss eliminates the need for pairwise contrastive losses and does not require any extra tunable hyper-parameters or pairwise preference data, streamlining the alignment pipeline to be as simple as supervised fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments across two challenging QA benchmarks and four reasoning benchmarks. The experimental results show that BNF achieves comparable performance to the best methods on QA benchmarks, while its performance decrease on the four reasoning benchmarks is significantly lower compared to the best methods, thus striking a better balance between value alignment and reasoning ability. In addition, we further validate the performance of BNF on non-pairwise datasets, and conduct in-depth analysis of log-likelihood and logit shifts across different preference optimization methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages,5 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, it may not be sufficient to directly apply open-source LLMs like Llama to certain real-world scenarios, since most of them are trained for \emph{general} purposes. Thus, the demands for customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently under-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new human preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new preference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization. Drawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed as a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum of two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train the LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human preference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making the application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to the residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the pre-trained LLM and the \emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function $r_1$. Moreover, we find that for a fixed pre-trained LLM, the reward function $r_2$ can be derived from the residual Q-function, enabling us to directly learn the residual Q-function from the new human preference data upon the Bradley-Terry model. We name our method Q-Adapter as it introduces an adapter module to approximate the residual Q-function for customizing the pre-trained LLM towards the new preference. Experiments based on the Llama-3.1 model on the DSP dataset and HH-RLHF dataset illustrate the superior effectiveness of Q-Adapter on both retaining existing knowledge and learning new preferences.

| **[FairMT-Bench: Benchmarking Fairness for Multi-turn Dialogue in Conversational LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19317v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns about fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, we draw from existing fairness datasets and employ our template to construct a multi-turn dialogue dataset, \texttt{FairMT-10K}. For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results show the current state of fairness in LLMs and showcase the utility of this novel approach for assessing fairness in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts, calling for future work to focus on LLM fairness improvement and the adoption of \texttt{FairMT-1K} in such efforts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy called Prereq-Tune to address this knowledge inconsistency and reduce hallucinations. Fundamentally, Prereq-Tune disentangles the learning of skills and knowledge, so the model learns only the task skills without being impacted by the knowledge inconsistency. To achieve this, Prereq-Tune introduces an additional prerequisite learning stage to learn the necessary knowledge for SFT, allowing subsequent SFT to focus only on task skills. Prereq-Tune can also be combined with fictitious synthetic data to enhance the grounding of LLM outputs to their internal knowledge. Experiments show that Prereq-Tune outperforms existing baselines in improving LLM's factuality across short QA and long-form generation tasks. It also opens new possibilities for knowledge-controlled generation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Prereq_tune.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ripple: Accelerating LLM Inference on Smartphones with Correlation-Aware Neuron Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19274v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet deploying them on mobile devices remains an arduous challenge due to their extensive computational and memory demands. While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints. In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art. As the first solution to optimize storage placement under sparsity, Ripple explores a new optimization space at the intersection of sparsity-driven algorithm and storage-level system co-design in LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

The perceived ability of LLMs to produce convincing fake news at scale poses new challenges for both human and automated fake news detection systems. To address this gap, this work presents the findings from a university-level competition which aimed to explore how LLMs can be used by humans to create fake news, and to assess the ability of human annotators and AI models to detect it. A total of 110 participants used LLMs to create 252 unique fake news stories, and 84 annotators participated in the detection tasks. Our findings indicate that LLMs are ~68% more effective at detecting real news than humans. However, for fake news detection, the performance of LLMs and humans remains comparable (~60% accuracy). Additionally, we examine the impact of visual elements (e.g., pictures) in news on the accuracy of detecting fake news stories. Finally, we also examine various strategies used by fake news creators to enhance the credibility of their AI-generated content. This work highlights the increasing complexity of detecting AI-generated fake news, particularly in collaborative human-AI settings.</p></details> |  |

However, their current functionalities are primarily limited to function-level development, restricting their effectiveness in complex project environments and specific application scenarios, such as complicated image-processing tasks. This paper presents a multi-agent framework that utilises a hybrid set of LLMs, including GPT-4o and locally deployed open-source models, which collaboratively complete auto-programming tasks. Each agent plays a distinct role in the software development cycle, collectively forming a virtual organisation that works together to produce software products. By establishing a tree-structured thought distribution and development mechanism across project, module, and function levels, this framework offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for code generation. We evaluated our approach using benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that VisionCoder significantly outperforms existing methods in image processing auto-programming tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing LLM-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19238v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research introduces a novel methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable and psychometrically validated personalities to Large Language Models-Based Agents (Agents) using the Big Five personality framework. It seeks to overcome the constraints of human subject studies, proposing Agents as an accessible tool for social science inquiry. Through a series of four studies, this research demonstrates the feasibility of assigning psychometrically valid personality traits to Agents, enabling them to replicate complex human-like behaviors. The first study establishes an understanding of personality constructs and personality tests within the semantic space of an LLM. Two subsequent studies -- using empirical and simulated data -- illustrate the process of creating Agents and validate the results by showing strong correspondence between human and Agent answers to personality tests. The final study further corroborates this correspondence by using Agents to replicate known human correlations between personality traits and decision-making behaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby validating the effectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and its applicability to social and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

Our study explores the use of smaller, more affordable LLMs for one-on-one tutoring in the context of solving reading comprehension problems. We developed a synthetic tutoring dialog dataset, evaluated by human teachers, and fine-tuned a smaller LLM using this dataset. Furthermore, we conducted an interactive experiment comparing the performance of the fine-tuned model with a larger model in real-world tutoring scenarios. Our results show that the fine-tuned model performs on par with the larger model but at a lower cost, demonstrating a viable, cost-effective approach for implementing LLM-based tutoring systems in educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a proxy-attack strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8*7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 90.3% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Curating Information Space Through Narrative](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19221v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Narratives are widely recognized as a powerful tool for structuring information and facilitating comprehension of complex ideas in various domains such as science communication. This paper investigates whether incorporating narrative elements can assist Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving complex problems more effectively. We propose a novel approach, Story of Thought (SoT), integrating narrative structures into prompting techniques for problem-solving. This approach involves constructing narratives around problem statements and creating a framework to identify and organize relevant information. Our experiments show that using various LLMs with SoT consistently surpasses using them with other techniques on physics, chemistry, math, and biology questions in both the GPQA and JEEBench datasets. The narrative-based information curation process in SoT enhances problem comprehension by contextualizing critical in-domain information and highlighting causal relationships within the problem space.</p></details> |  |

Existing training-time alignment methods require full re-training when a change is needed and inference-time ones typically require access to the reward model at each inference step. To address these limitations, we introduce inference-time model alignment method that learns encoded representations of preference dimensions, called \textit{Alignment Vectors} (AV). These representations are computed by subtraction of the base model from the aligned model as in model editing enabling dynamically adjusting the model behavior during inference through simple linear operations. Even though the preference dimensions can span various granularity levels, here we focus on three gradual response levels across three specialized domains: medical, legal, and financial, exemplifying its practical potential. This new alignment paradigm introduces adjustable preference knobs during inference, allowing users to tailor their LLM outputs while reducing the inference cost by half compared to the prompt engineering approach. Additionally, we find that AVs are transferable across different fine-tuning stages of the same model, demonstrating their flexibility. AVs also facilitate multidomain, diverse preference alignment, making the process 12x faster than the retraining approach.</p></details> |  |

We conduct a set of experiments translating Southern Quechua to Spanish and examine the informativity of various types of context retrieved from a constrained database of digitized pedagogical materials (dictionaries and grammar lessons) and parallel corpora. Using both automatic and human evaluation of model output, we conduct ablation studies that manipulate (1) context type (morpheme translations, grammar descriptions, and corpus examples), (2) retrieval methods (automated vs. manual), and (3) model type. Our results suggest that even relatively small LLMs are capable of utilizing prompt context for zero-shot low-resource translation when provided a minimally sufficient amount of relevant linguistic information. However, the variable effects of context type, retrieval method, model type, and language-specific factors highlight the limitations of using even the best LLMs as translation systems for the majority of the world's 7,000+ languages and their speakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Ninth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT24)</p></details> |

With healthcare systems and online communities facing limitations in resolving ADR-related issues, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to fill this gap. Despite the increasing capabilities of LLMs, past research has not explored their capabilities in detecting ADRs related to psychiatric medications or in providing effective harm reduction strategies. To address this, we introduce the Psych-ADR benchmark and the Adverse Drug Reaction Response Assessment (ADRA) framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance in detecting ADR expressions and delivering expert-aligned mitigation strategies. Our analyses show that LLMs struggle with understanding the nuances of ADRs and differentiating between types of ADRs. While LLMs align with experts in terms of expressed emotions and tone of the text, their responses are more complex, harder to read, and only 70.86% aligned with expert strategies. Furthermore, they provide less actionable advice by a margin of 12.32% on average. Our work provides a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in strategy-driven tasks within high-risk domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Read-ME that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. Read-ME outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to 10.1% on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to 6.1%.

| **[LLM Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19117v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project aims to investigate a novel sequence generation method inspired by the AlphaGo paradigm, adapting it for use with large language models (LLMs). The proposed approach involves creating search trees of different possible completions and evaluating these completions based on model confidence. By considering various paths in the search tree and scoring them according to the model's confidence in each completion, we can generate diverse and high-quality sequences. This research explores the implementation of this paradigm by using confidence as a proxy for response quality akin to beam search \citep{vijayakumar2016diverse}. The primary goal of this paper is to outline the paradigm and demonstrate its potential, rather than focusing on achieving perfect results. The paper will outline the reasons why we believe this paradigm has the potential to improve LLMs in the following manners: 1) increase output quality, 2) decrease errors, 3) eliminate or reduce the compound error problems, 4) generate diverse and creative completions, 5) allow for iterative problem-solving, and 6) self-training. We expect this approach to yield a set of diverse and coherent sequences, offering insights into balancing exploration and exploitation in sequence generation. Potential applications include creative text generation tasks, such as storytelling and content creation, as well as other natural language processing domains, like machine translation and automated summarization. The goal is that the model will be far more effective as it will be able to consider many possible variations allowing it to find the ideal completion. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of effective search strategies in sequence generation and their impact on generating high-quality, varied textual outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TesseraQ: Ultra Low-Bit LLM Post-Training Quantization with Block Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19103v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, albeit at the cost of immense memory and computation requirements. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is becoming the de facto method to reduce the memory footprint and improve the inference throughput of LLMs. In this work, we aim to push the upper limit of LLM PTQ by optimizing the weight rounding parameters with the block reconstruction technique, a predominant method in previous vision models. We propose TesseraQ, a new state-of-the-art PTQ technique, to quantize the weights of LLMs to ultra-low bits. To effectively optimize the rounding in LLMs and stabilize the reconstruction process, we introduce progressive adaptive rounding. This approach iteratively transits the soft rounding variables to hard variables during the reconstruction process. Additionally, we optimize the dequantization scale parameters to fully leverage the block reconstruction technique. We demonstrate that TesseraQ can be seamlessly integrated with existing scaling or clipping-based PTQ algorithms such as AWQ and OmniQuant, significantly enhancing their performance and establishing a new state-of-the-art. For instance, when compared to AWQ, TesseraQ improves the wikitext2 perplexity from 14.65 to 6.82 and average downstream accuracy from 50.52 to 59.27 with 2-bit weight-only quantization of LLaMA-2-7B. Across a range of quantization schemes, including W2A16, W3A16, W3A3, and W4A4, TesseraQ consistently exhibits superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From a Tiny Slip to a Giant Leap: An LLM-Based Simulation for Fake News Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19064v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing spread of misinformation online, research has increasingly focused on detecting and tracking fake news. However, an overlooked issue is that fake news does not naturally exist in social networks -- it often originates from distorted facts or deliberate fabrication by malicious actors. Understanding how true news gradually evolves into fake news is critical for early detection and prevention, reducing its spread and impact. Hence, in this paper, we take the first step toward simulating and revealing this evolution, proposing a Fake News evolUtion Simulation framEwork (FUSE) based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we employ LLM as agents to represent individuals in a simulated social network. We define four types of agents commonly observed in daily interactions: spreaders, who propagate information; commentators, who provide opinions and interpretations; verifiers, who check the accuracy of information; and bystanders, who passively observe without engaging. For simulated environments, we model various social network structures, such as high-clustering networks and scale-free networks, to mirror real-world network dynamics. Each day, the agents engage in belief exchanges, reflect on their thought processes, and reintroduce the news accordingly. Given the lack of prior work in this area, we developed a FUSE-EVAL evaluation framework to measure the deviation from true news during the fake news evolution process. The results show that FUSE successfully captures the underlying patterns of how true news transforms into fake news and accurately reproduces previously discovered instances of fake news, aligning closely with human evaluations. Moreover, our work provides insights into the fact that combating fake news should not be delayed until it has fully evolved; instead, prevention in advance is key to achieving better outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the recent advancement of large language models (LLMs) that can facilitate the integration of the textural information and images, here we present a novel LLM-driven multimodal AI, namely LLMSeg, that utilizes the clinical text information and is applicable to the challenging task of target volume contouring for radiation therapy, and validate it within the context of breast cancer radiation therapy target volume contouring. Using external validation and data-insufficient environments, which attributes highly conducive to real-world applications, we demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits markedly improved performance compared to conventional unimodal AI models, particularly exhibiting robust generalization performance and data efficiency. To our best knowledge, this is the first LLM-driven multimodal AI model that integrates the clinical text information into target volume delineation for radiation oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Nature Communications, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-53387-y</p></details> |

A Survey and Evaluation on Detection Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18966v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great performance across various benchmarks, showing potential as general-purpose task solvers. However, as LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of data, a significant concern in their evaluation is data contamination, where overlap between training data and evaluation datasets inflates performance assessments. While multiple approaches have been developed to identify data contamination, these approaches rely on specific assumptions that may not hold universally across different settings. To bridge this gap, we systematically review 47 papers on data contamination detection, categorize the underlying assumptions, and assess whether they have been rigorously validated. We identify and analyze eight categories of assumptions and test three of them as case studies. Our analysis reveals that when classifying instances used for pretraining LLMs, detection approaches based on these three assumptions perform close to random guessing, suggesting that current LLMs learn data distributions rather than memorizing individual instances. Overall, this work underscores the importance of approaches clearly stating their underlying assumptions and testing their validity across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 tab...</summary><p>2 tables and 1 figures in the main text.

This performance gap deepens the digital divide, preventing developers using LRPLs from benefiting equally from LLM advancements and reinforcing disparities in innovation within underrepresented programming communities. While generating additional training data for LRPLs is promising, it faces two key challenges: manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, and LLM-generated LRPL code is often of subpar quality. The underlying cause of this issue is the gap between natural language to programming language gap (NL-PL Gap), which is especially pronounced in LRPLs due to limited aligned data. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called Bridge-Coder, which leverages LLMs' intrinsic capabilities to enhance the performance on LRPLs. Our method consists of two key stages. Bridge Generation, where we create high-quality dataset by utilizing LLMs' general knowledge understanding, proficiency in HRPLs, and in-context learning abilities. Then, we apply the Bridged Alignment, which progressively improves the alignment between NL instructions and LRPLs. Experimental results across multiple LRPLs show that Bridge-Coder significantly enhances model performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Furthermore, we offer a detailed analysis of the key components of our method, providing valuable insights for future work aimed at addressing the challenges associated with LRPLs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning in Early-Exit LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18952v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing the size of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to lead to better performance. However, this comes at the cost of slower and more expensive inference. Early-exiting is a promising approach for improving the efficiency of LLM inference by enabling next token prediction at intermediate layers. Yet, the large vocabulary size in modern LLMs makes the confidence estimation required for exit decisions computationally expensive, diminishing the efficiency gains. To address this, we propose dynamically pruning the vocabulary at test time for each token. Specifically, the vocabulary is pruned at one of the initial layers, and the smaller vocabulary is then used throughout the rest of the forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that such post-hoc dynamic vocabulary pruning improves the efficiency of confidence estimation in early-exit LLMs while maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10508v4)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social biases can manifest in language agency. While several studies approached agency-related bias in human-written language, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, which fall short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the novel Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE leverages 5,400 template-based prompts, an accurate agency classifier, and corresponding bias metrics to test for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. We also contribute the Language Agency Classification (LAC) dataset, consisting of 3,724 agentic and communal sentences. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. Those who are at the intersection of gender and racial minority groups--such as Black females--are consistently described by texts with lower levels of agency, aligning with real-world social inequalities; (3) Among the 3 LLMs investigated, Llama3 demonstrates the greatest overall bias; (4) Not only does prompt-based mitigation fail to resolve language agency bias in LLMs, but it frequently leads to the exacerbation of biases in generated texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Blind Solvers to Logical Thinkers: Benchmarking LLMs' Logical Integrity on Faulty Mathematical Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18921v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the math problem: "Lily received 3 cookies from her best friend yesterday and ate 5 for breakfast. Today, her friend gave her 3 more cookies. How many cookies does Lily have now?" Many large language models (LLMs) in previous research approach this problem by calculating the answer "1" using the equation "3 - 5 + 3." However, from a human perspective, we recognize the inherent flaw in this problem: Lily cannot eat 5 cookies if she initially only had 3. This discrepancy prompts a key question: Are current LLMs merely Blind Solver that apply mathematical operations without deeper reasoning, or can they function as Logical Thinker capable of identifying logical inconsistencies? To explore this question, we propose a benchmark dataset, FaultyMath, which includes faulty math problems of rich diversity: i) multiple mathematical categories, e.g., algebra, geometry, number theory, etc., ii) varying levels of difficulty, and iii) different origins of faultiness -- ranging from violations of common sense and ambiguous statements to mathematical contradictions and more. We evaluate a broad spectrum of LLMs, including open-source, closed-source, and math-specialized models, using FaultyMath across three dimensions: (i) How accurately can the models detect faulty math problems without being explicitly prompted to do so? (ii) When provided with hints -- either correct or misleading -- about the validity of the problems, to what extent do LLMs adapt to become reliable Logical Thinker? (iii) How trustworthy are the explanations generated by LLMs when they recognize a math problem as flawed? Through extensive experimentation and detailed analysis, our results demonstrate that existing LLMs largely function as Blind Solver and fall short of the reasoning capabilities required to perform as Logical Thinker.</p></details> |  |

Just-in-time processing of a context is inefficient due to the quadratic cost of self-attention operations, and caching is desirable. However, caching transformer states can easily require almost as much space as the model parameters. When the right context isn't known in advance, caching ICL can be challenging. This work addresses these limitations by introducing models that, inspired by the encoder-decoder architecture, use cross-attention to condition generation on reference text without the prompt. More precisely, we leverage pre-trained decoder-only models and only train a small number of added layers. We use Question-Answering (QA) as a testbed to evaluate the ability of our models to perform conditional generation and observe that they outperform ICL, are comparable to fine-tuned prompted LLMs, and drastically reduce the space footprint relative to standard KV caching by two orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are LLMs Better than Reported? Detecting Label Errors and Mitigating Their Effect on Model Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18889v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NLP benchmarks rely on standardized datasets for training and evaluating models and are crucial for advancing the field. Traditionally, expert annotations ensure high-quality labels; however, the cost of expert annotation does not scale well with the growing demand for larger datasets required by modern models. While crowd-sourcing provides a more scalable solution, it often comes at the expense of annotation precision and consistency. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance the annotation process, particularly for detecting label errors in existing datasets. In this work, we consider the recent approach of LLM-as-a-judge, leveraging an ensemble of LLMs to flag potentially mislabeled examples. Through a case study of four datasets from the TRUE benchmark, covering different tasks and domains, we empirically analyze the labeling quality of existing datasets, and compare expert, crowd-sourced, and our LLM-based annotations in terms of agreement, label quality, and efficiency, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each annotation method. Our findings reveal a substantial number of label errors, which, when corrected, induce a significant upward shift in reported model performance. This suggests that many of the LLMs so-called mistakes are due to label errors rather than genuine model failures. Additionally, we discuss the implications of mislabeled data and propose methods to mitigate them in training to improve model performance.</p></details> |  |

It mitigates the disproportionate penalization of underrepresented languages, promoting fairness and minimizing adverse phenomena such as code-switching and broken grammar. Additionally, we introduce new metrics to evaluate language quality, revealing that vocabulary size significantly impacts the quality of generated text.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies highlight that these abilities consist of two main parts: recognizing key information from visual inputs and conducting reasoning over it. Thus, a promising approach to enhance MLLMs is to construct relevant training data focusing on the two aspects. However, collecting and annotating complex charts and questions is costly and time-consuming, and ensuring the quality of annotated answers remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), a cost-effective, efficient and easily scalable data synthesis method for distilling visual reasoning abilities from LLMs to MLLMs. The code serves as an intermediary that translates visual chart representations into textual representations, enabling LLMs to understand cross-modal information. Specifically, we employ text-based synthesizing techniques to construct chart-plotting code and produce ReachQA, a dataset containing 3k reasoning-intensive charts and 20k Q&A pairs to enhance both recognition and reasoning abilities. Experiments show that when fine-tuned with our data, models not only perform well on chart-related benchmarks, but also demonstrate improved multimodal reasoning abilities on general mathematical benchmarks like MathVista.

| **[A Little Help Goes a Long Way: Efficient LLM Training by Leveraging Small LMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18779v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A primary challenge in large language model (LLM) development is their onerous pre-training cost. Typically, such pre-training involves optimizing a self-supervised objective (such as next-token prediction) over a large corpus. This paper explores a promising paradigm to improve LLM pre-training efficiency and quality by suitably leveraging a small language model (SLM). In particular, this paradigm relies on an SLM to both (1) provide soft labels as additional training supervision, and (2) select a small subset of valuable ("informative" and "hard") training examples. Put together, this enables an effective transfer of the SLM's predictive distribution to the LLM, while prioritizing specific regions of the training data distribution. Empirically, this leads to reduced LLM training time compared to standard training, while improving the overall quality. Theoretically, we develop a statistical framework to systematically study the utility of SLMs in enabling efficient training of high-quality LLMs. In particular, our framework characterizes how the SLM's seemingly low-quality supervision can enhance the training of a much more capable LLM. Furthermore, it also highlights the need for an adaptive utilization of such supervision, by striking a balance between the bias and variance introduced by the SLM-provided soft labels. We corroborate our theoretical framework by improving the pre-training of an LLM with 2.8B parameters by utilizing a smaller LM with 1.5B parameters on the Pile dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Why Does the Effective Context Length of LLMs Fall Short?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18745v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in distributed training and efficient attention mechanisms have significantly expanded the context window sizes of large language models (LLMs). However, recent work reveals that the effective context lengths of open-source LLMs often fall short, typically not exceeding half of their training lengths. In this work, we attribute this limitation to the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions formed in LLMs pretraining and post-training stages, which impedes their ability to effectively gather distant information. To address this challenge, we introduce ShifTed Rotray position embeddING (STRING). STRING shifts well-trained positions to overwrite the original ineffective positions during inference, enhancing performance within their existing training lengths. Experimental results show that without additional training, STRING dramatically improves the performance of the latest large-scale models, such as Llama3.1 70B and Qwen2 72B, by over 10 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER and InfiniteBench, establishing new state-of-the-art results for open-source LLMs. Compared to commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with \method even achieves better performance than GPT-4-128K and clearly surpasses Claude 2 and Kimi-chat.</p></details> |  |

Tested on the task of the online prediction of wind-speed graph signals, our model outperforms online graph filtering algorithms in terms of accuracy, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in effectively addressing partially observed signals in graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Good Are LLMs for Literary Translation, Really? Literary Translation Evaluation with Humans and LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18697v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused on literary machine translation (MT) as a new challenge in MT. However, the evaluation of literary MT remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing discussion by introducing LITEVAL-CORPUS, a paragraph-level parallel corpus comprising multiple verified human translations and outputs from 9 MT systems, which totals over 2k paragraphs and includes 13k annotated sentences across four language pairs, costing 4.5k Euro. This corpus enables us to (i) examine the consistency and adequacy of multiple annotation schemes, (ii) compare evaluations by students and professionals, and (iii) assess the effectiveness of LLM-based metrics. We find that Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM), as the de facto standard in non-literary human MT evaluation, is inadequate for literary translation: While Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) with students and Scalar Quality Metric (SQM) with professional translators prefer human translations at rates of ~82% and ~94%, respectively, MQM with student annotators prefers human professional translations over the translations of the best-performing LLMs in only ~42% of cases. While automatic metrics generally show a moderate correlation with human MQM and SQM, they struggle to accurately identify human translations, with rates of at most ~20%. Our overall evaluation indicates that human professional translations consistently outperform LLM translations, where even the most recent LLMs tend to produce more literal and less diverse translations compared to human translations. However, newer LLMs such as GPT-4o perform substantially better than older ones.</p></details> |  |

Recent research indicates that continually scaling up data synthesis from strong models (e.g., GPT-4) can further elicit reasoning performance. Though promising, the open-sourced community still lacks high-quality data at scale and scalable data synthesis methods with affordable costs. To address this, we introduce ScaleQuest, a scalable and novel data synthesis method that utilizes "small-size" (e.g., 7B) open-source models to generate questions from scratch without the need for seed data with complex augmentation constraints. With the efficient ScaleQuest, we automatically constructed a mathematical reasoning dataset consisting of 1 million problem-solution pairs, which are more effective than existing open-sourced datasets. It can universally increase the performance of mainstream open-source models (i.e., Mistral, Llama3, DeepSeekMath, and Qwen2-Math) by achieving 29.2% to 46.4% gains on MATH. Notably, simply fine-tuning the Qwen2-Math-7B-Base model with our dataset can even surpass Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct, a strong and well-aligned model on closed-source data, and proprietary models such as GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3.5 Sonnet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs with Semantic Space Alignment for Enhanced Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18686v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging large language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention and introduced novel perspectives in time series classification. However, existing approaches often overlook the crucial dynamic temporal information inherent in time series data and face challenges in aligning this data with textual semantics. To address these limitations, we propose HiTime, a hierarchical multi-modal model that seamlessly integrates temporal information into LLMs for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Our model employs a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data through both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. To facilitate semantic space alignment between time series and text, we introduce a dual-view contrastive alignment module that bridges the gap between modalities. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid prompting strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained LLM in a parameter-efficient manner. By effectively incorporating dynamic temporal features and ensuring semantic alignment, HiTime enables LLMs to process continuous time series data and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance through text generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiTime significantly enhances time series classification accuracy compared to most competitive baseline methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating temporal features into LLMs, paving the way for advanced time series analysis. The code is publicly available for further research and validation.

The categorization is based on their taxonomy, and it facilitates the end user's search process. The use of a Smart ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, where \emph{Smart} indicates the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is central to this endeavor. Methods: The contents describing STTs are derived from PDF catalogs, where PDF-scraping techniques extract QR codes, images, links, and text information. Duplicate STTs between the catalogs are removed, and the remaining ones are classified based on their text information using Large Language Models (LLMs). Finally, the data is transformed to comply with the Dublin Core metadata structure (the observatory's metadata structure), chosen for its wide acceptance and flexibility. Results: The Smart ETL process to import STTs to the observatory combines PDF-scraping techniques with LLMs for text content-based classification. Our preliminary results have demonstrated the potential of LLMs for text content-based classification. Conclusion: The proposed approach's feasibility is a step towards efficient content-based classification, not only in Smart Tourism but also adaptable to other fields. Future work will mainly focus on refining this classification process.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we conduct a theoretical analysis to better understand why No Position Encoding (NoPE) fails outside its effective range, as well as examining the power of Position Encoding (PE) in this context. Our findings reveal that with meticulous weave position, PE can indeed be extended beyond effective range. Our theorems establish that LLMs equipped with weave PE can achieve improved extrapolation performance without additional cost. Furthermore, we introduce a novel weave PE method, Mesa-Extrapolation, which utilizes a chunk-based triangular attention matrix and applies Stair PE to manage the final chunk. This method not only retains competitive performance but also offers substantial benefits such as significantly reduced memory demand and faster inference speed. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Mesa-Extrapolation, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution to enhancing LLMs applicative reach.

However, they incur higher inference cost and latency compared to smaller LLMs. Knowledge distillation provides a way to use outputs from these large, capable teacher models to train smaller student models which can be used for inference at lower cost and latency, while retaining comparable accuracy. We investigate the efficacy of distillation using the Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct teacher and the smaller Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct student models. Contributions of this work include (a) We evaluate the generalizability of distillation with the above Llama-3.1 teacher-student pairs across different tasks and datasets (b) We show that using synthetic data during distillation significantly improves the accuracy of 8B and 70B models, and when used with reasoning chains, even matches or surpasses the zero-shot accuracy of 405B model on some datasets (c) We empirically show that distillation enables 8B and 70B models to internalize 405B's reasoning ability by using only standard fine-tuning (without customizing any loss function). This allows cost and latency-efficient student model inference. (d) We show pitfalls in evaluation of distillation, and present task-specific evaluation, including both human and LLM-grading, and ground-truth based traditional accuracy benchmarks. This methodical study brings out the fundamental importance of synthetic data quality in knowledge distillation, and of combining multiple, task-specific ways of accuracy and quality evaluation in assessing the effectiveness of distillation.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

These workflows often involve continuous modifications, which are labor-intensive and prone to errors. Therefore, there is an increasing need for more efficient and cost-effective Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solutions to accelerate new hardware development. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in contextual understanding, logical reasoning, and response generation. Since hardware designs and intermediate scripts can be expressed in text format, it is reasonable to explore whether integrating LLMs into EDA could simplify and fully automate the entire workflow. Accordingly, this paper discusses such possibilities in several aspects, covering hardware description language (HDL) generation, code debugging, design verification, and physical implementation. Two case studies, along with their future outlook, are introduced to highlight the capabilities of LLMs in code repair and testbench generation. Finally, future directions and challenges are highlighted to further explore the potential of LLMs in shaping the next-generation EDA</p></details> |  |

However, the nature and correlation of these features with human-engineered ones remain unclear. In this study, we delve into the mechanistic workings of state-of-the-art, fine-tuning-based passage-reranking transformer networks. Our approach involves a probing-based, layer-by-layer analysis of neurons within ranking LLMs to identify individual or groups of known human-engineered and semantic features within the network's activations. We explore a wide range of features, including lexical, document structure, query-document interaction, advanced semantic, interaction-based, and LLM-specific features, to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive ranking decisions in LLMs. Our results reveal a set of features that are prominently represented in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably absent. Additionally, we observe distinct behaviors of LLMs when processing low versus high relevance queries and when encountering out-of-distribution query and document sets. By examining these features within activations, we aim to enhance the interpretability and performance of LLMs in ranking tasks. Our findings provide valuable insights for the development of more effective and transparent ranking models, with significant implications for the broader information retrieval community.

To address this, we propose a prompting framework that generates adversarial variants of MWPs by adding irrelevant variables. We introduce a dataset, PROBLEMATHIC, containing both adversarial and non-adversarial MWPs. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are susceptible to distraction by numerical noise, resulting in an average relative performance drop of ~26% on adversarial MWPs. To mitigate this, we fine-tune LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral) on the adversarial samples from our dataset. Fine-tuning on adversarial training instances improves performance on adversarial MWPs by ~8%, indicating increased robustness to noise and improved ability to identify relevant data for reasoning. Finally, to assess the generalizability of our prompting framework, we introduce GSM-8K-Adv, an adversarial variant of the GSM-8K benchmark. LLMs continue to struggle when faced with adversarial information, reducing performance by up to 6%.</p></details> |  |

The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts. This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD) approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL) for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the high risk threshold for complexity.</p></details> |  |

Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly 100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49% ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying LLM safety.

The current data synthesis process generally involves sampling a set of tools, formulating a requirement based on these tools, and generating the call statements. However, tools sampled randomly lack relevance, making them difficult to combine and thus reducing the diversity of the data. Additionally, current work overlooks the coherence between turns of dialogues, leading to a gap between the synthesized data and real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Graph-based Sampling strategy to sample more relevant tool combinations, and a Planned-generation strategy to create plans that guide the synthesis of coherent dialogues. We integrate these two strategies and enable multiple agents to synthesize the dialogue data interactively, resulting in our tool-calling data synthesis pipeline ToolFlow. Data quality assessments demonstrate improvements in the naturalness and coherence of our synthesized dialogues. Finally, we apply SFT on LLaMA-3.1-8B using 8,000 synthetic dialogues generated with ToolFlow. Results show that the model achieves tool-calling performance comparable to or even surpassing GPT-4, while maintaining strong general capabilities.</p></details> |  |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation. Recent state-of-the-art multilingual large language models (LLMs) demonstrate excellent multilingual abilities in various aspects including understanding CS, but the power of CS in eliciting language-specific knowledge is yet to be discovered. Therefore, we investigate the effectiveness of code-switching on a wide range of multilingual LLMs in terms of knowledge activation, or the act of identifying and leveraging knowledge for reasoning. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide a comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs, especially on language-specific domains. In addition, the performance gap between CS and English is larger in models that show excellent monolingual abilities, suggesting that there exists a correlation with CS and Korean proficiency.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Persuasive chatbots employed responsibly for social good can be an enabler of positive individual and social change. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. Furthermore, they employ only a handful of pre-defined persuasion strategies. We propose PersuaBot, a zero-shot chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that is factual and more persuasive by leveraging many more nuanced strategies. PersuaBot uses an LLM to first generate natural responses, from which the strategies used are extracted. To combat hallucination of LLMs, Persuabot replace any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the extracted strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation, recommendations, and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero-shot approach is more persuasive than prior work, while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state-of-the-art knowledge-oriented chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Most existing research has predominantly focused on the correctness of AI-generated solutions to mathematical problems. In this work, we argue that beyond producing correct answers, AI systems should also be capable of, or assist humans in, developing novel solutions to mathematical challenges. This study explores the creative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning, an aspect that has received limited attention in prior research. We introduce a novel framework and benchmark, CreativeMath, which encompasses problems ranging from middle school curricula to Olympic-level competitions, designed to assess LLMs' ability to propose innovative solutions after some known solutions have been provided. Our experiments demonstrate that, while LLMs perform well on standard mathematical tasks, their capacity for creative problem-solving varies considerably. Notably, the Gemini-1.5-Pro model outperformed other LLMs in generating novel solutions. This research opens a new frontier in evaluating AI creativity, shedding light on both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in fostering mathematical innovation, and setting the stage for future developments in AI-assisted mathematical discovery.</p></details> |  |

We take the next step beyond human-LLM collaboration to explore this multi-LLM scenario by generating the first exclusively LLM-generated collaborative stories dataset called CollabStory. We focus on single-author ($N=1$) to multi-author (up to $N=5$) scenarios, where multiple LLMs co-author stories. We generate over 32k stories using open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. Further, we take inspiration from the PAN tasks that have set the standard for human-human multi-author writing tasks and analysis. We extend their authorship-related tasks for multi-LLM settings and present baselines for LLM-LLM collaboration. We find that current baselines are not able to handle this emerging scenario. Thus, CollabStory is a resource that could help propel an understanding as well as the development of techniques to discern the use of multiple LLMs. This is crucial to study in the context of writing tasks since LLM-LLM collaboration could potentially overwhelm ongoing challenges related to plagiarism detection, credit assignment, maintaining academic integrity in educational settings, and addressing copyright infringement concerns.

| **[Optimizing the role of human evaluation in LLM-based spoken document summarization systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18218v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of powerful LLMs has led to a paradigm shift in abstractive summarization of spoken documents. The properties that make LLMs so valuable for this task -- creativity, ability to produce fluent speech, and ability to abstract information from large corpora -- also present new challenges to evaluating their content. Quick, cost-effective automatic evaluations such as ROUGE and BERTScore offer promise, but do not yet show competitive performance when compared to human evaluations. We draw on methodologies from the social sciences to propose an evaluation paradigm for spoken document summarization explicitly tailored for generative AI content. We provide detailed evaluation criteria and best practices guidelines to ensure robustness in the experimental design, replicability, and trustworthiness of human evaluation studies. We additionally include two case studies that show how these human-in-the-loop evaluation methods have been implemented at a major U.S. technology company.</p></details> |  |

Building upon recent work demonstrating LLMs' effectiveness in creating word-level adversarial examples, we argue for expanding this concept to encompass a broader range of attack types, including adversarial patches, universal perturbations, and targeted attacks. We posit that LLMs' sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities can produce more effective, semantically coherent, and human-like adversarial examples across various domains and classifier architectures. This paradigm shift in adversarial NLP has far-reaching implications, potentially enhancing model robustness, uncovering new vulnerabilities, and driving innovation in defense mechanisms. By exploring this new frontier, we aim to contribute to the development of more secure, reliable, and trustworthy NLP systems for critical applications.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Recent work demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be easily removed by fine-tuning with a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples, i.e., fine-tuning attacks. We take a further step to understand fine-tuning attacks in multilingual LLMs. We first discover cross-lingual generalization of fine-tuning attacks: using a few adversarially chosen instruction-following examples in one language, multilingual LLMs can also be easily compromised (e.g., multilingual LLMs fail to refuse harmful prompts in other languages). Motivated by this finding, we hypothesize that safety-related information is language-agnostic and propose a new method termed Safety Information Localization (SIL) to identify the safety-related information in the model parameter space. Through SIL, we validate this hypothesis and find that only changing 20% of weight parameters in fine-tuning attacks can break safety alignment across all languages. Furthermore, we provide evidence to the alternative pathways hypothesis for why freezing safety-related parameters does not prevent fine-tuning attacks, and we demonstrate that our attack vector can still jailbreak LLMs adapted to new languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This proliferation has highlighted the need for quick, high-quality, and cost-effective LLM query response methods. Yet, no single LLM exists to efficiently balance this trilemma. Some models are powerful but extremely costly, while others are fast and inexpensive but qualitatively inferior. To address this challenge, we present TO-Router, a non-monolithic LLM querying system that seamlessly integrates various LLM experts into a single query interface and dynamically routes incoming queries to the most high-performant expert based on query's requirements. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that when compared to standalone expert models, TO-Router improves query efficiency by up to 40\%, and leads to significant cost reductions of up to 30%, while maintaining or enhancing model performance by up to 10%.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning in semantic understanding, especially in feature extraction and representation learning, this study introduces a new multimodal contrastive pretaining framework that aims to improve the quality and robustness of learned representations of 12-lead ECG signals. Our framework comprises two key components, including Cardio Query Assistant (CQA) and ECG Semantics Integrator(ESI). CQA integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to leverage large language models (LLMs) and external medical knowledge to generate detailed textual descriptions of ECGs. The generated text is enriched with information about demographics and waveform patterns. ESI integrates both contrastive and captioning loss to pretrain ECG encoders for enhanced representations. We validate our approach through various downstream tasks, including arrhythmia detection and ECG-based subject identification. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over strong baselines in these tasks. These baselines encompass supervised and self-supervised learning methods, as well as prior multimodal pretraining approaches.</p></details> |  |

Naija is a Nigerian-Pidgin spoken by approx. 120M speakers in Nigeria and it is a mixed language (e.g., English, Portuguese, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo). Although it has mainly been a spoken language until recently, there are now various platforms publishing exclusively in Naija such as Naija Wikipedia. However, it is hard to distinguish by non-native from a larger pidgin languages spoken across West Africa known as West African Pidgin English (WAPE) -- which is more simplied and understandable by wider audience in Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon. BBC news platform publishes exclusively in WAPE to cater for several countries in West Africa. In our paper, we show through statistical analyses and Machine Translation experiments that these two creole varieties do not represent each other (i.e., there are linguistic differences in word order and vocabulary) and Generative AI operates only based on WAPE. In other words, Naija is under-represented in Generative AI, and it is hard to teach LLMs with few examples.</p></details> | under review |

Adapting existing supervised and unsupervised solutions for the Russian language faces several limitations due to the rich morphology of Russian and the limited number of training datasets available. Recent studies conducted on English texts show that large language models (LLMs) successfully address the task of generating keyphrases. LLMs allow achieving impressive results without task-specific fine-tuning, using text prompts instead. In this work, we access the performance of prompt-based methods for generating keyphrases for Russian scientific abstracts. First, we compare the performance of zero-shot and few-shot prompt-based methods, fine-tuned models, and unsupervised methods. Then we assess strategies for selecting keyphrase examples in a few-shot setting. We present the outcomes of human evaluation of the generated keyphrases and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the models through expert assessment. Our results suggest that prompt-based methods can outperform common baselines even using simple text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 12th International Conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts (AIST'2024)</p></details> |

To improve GPU utilization, recent systems use hybrid batching that combines the prefill and decode phases of different requests into the same batch. Hybrid batching works well for linear operations as it amortizes the cost of loading model weights from HBM. However, attention computation in hybrid batches remains inefficient because existing attention kernels are optimized for either prefill or decode. In this paper, we present POD-Attention -- the first GPU kernel that efficiently computes attention for hybrid batches. POD-Attention aims to maximize the utilization of both compute and memory bandwidth by carefully allocating the GPU's resources such that prefill and decode operations happen concurrently on the same multiprocessor. We integrate POD-Attention in a state-of-the-art LLM inference scheduler Sarathi-Serve. POD-Attention speeds up attention computation by up to 75% (mean 28%) and increases LLM serving throughput by up to 22% in offline inference. In online inference, POD-Attention enables lower time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-between-tokens (TBT), and request execution latency versus Sarathi-Serve.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Assisted Multi-Teacher Continual Learning for Visual Question Answering in Robotic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16664v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual question answering (VQA) is crucial for promoting surgical education. In practice, the needs of trainees are constantly evolving, such as learning more surgical types, adapting to different robots, and learning new surgical instruments and techniques for various surgeries. However, patient data privacy often restricts the availability of old data when updating the model, necessitating an exemplar-free continual learning (CL) setup. Prior CL studies overlooked two vital problems in the surgical domain: 1) large domain shifts from diverse surgical operations collected from multiple sources, and 2) severe data imbalance arising from the uneven presence of surgical instruments or activities. This paper proposes addressing these problems with a multimodal large language model (LLM) and an adaptive weight assignment methodology. We first develop a new multi-teacher CL framework that leverages a multimodal LLM as the additional teacher. The strong generalization ability of the LLM can bridge the knowledge gap when domain shifts and data imbalances occur. We then put forth a novel data processing method that transforms complex LLM embeddings into logits compatible with our CL framework. We further design an adaptive weight assignment approach that balances the generalization ability of the LLM and the domain expertise of the old CL model. Finally, to comprehensively test the effectiveness of our proposed method, we have also constructed two new surgical VQA datasets that are largely different from existing ones and could be valuable resources for future research. Extensive experimental results on the tested datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method to other advanced CL schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accapted by 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

We also show that ThorV2 is far more reliable and scales better to multistep tasks compared to traditional models. Our work offers the tantalizing possibility of more accurate function-calling compared to today's best-performing models using significantly smaller LLMs. These advancements have significant implications for the development of more capable AI assistants and the broader application of LLMs in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages for main paper, 21 pages in total including references and appendix, 10 figures</p></details> |

While efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have proven useful, recent findings show that controlling uncertainty must go beyond calibration: predicted scores may deviate significantly from the actual posterior probabilities due to the impact of grouping loss. In this work, we construct a new evaluation dataset derived from a knowledge base to assess confidence scores given to answers of Mistral and LLaMA. Experiments show that they tend to be overconfident. Further, we show that they are more overconfident on some answers than others, \emph{eg} depending on the nationality of the person in the query. In uncertainty-quantification theory, this is grouping loss. To address this, we propose a solution to reconfidence LLMs, canceling not only calibration but also grouping loss. The LLMs, after the reconfidencing process, indicate improved confidence alignment with the accuracy of their responses.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

TRAIT: Personality Testset designed for LLMs with Psychometrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14703v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their adaptation in various domains as conversational agents. We wonder: can personality tests be applied to these agents to analyze their behavior, similar to humans? We introduce TRAIT, a new benchmark consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs. TRAIT is built on two psychometrically validated small human questionnaires, Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3), enhanced with the ATOMIC-10X knowledge graph to a variety of real-world scenarios. TRAIT also outperforms existing personality tests for LLMs in terms of reliability and validity, achieving the highest scores across four key metrics: Content Validity, Internal Validity, Refusal Rate, and Reliability. Using TRAIT, we reveal two notable insights into personalities of LLMs: 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality, which is highly influenced by their training data (e.g., data used for alignment tuning), and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits, such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness, suggesting the need for further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Under review</p></details> |

Various techniques have been developed to tackle these challenges, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which involves introducing a parallel trainable low-rank matrix to the fixed pre-trained weights at each layer. However, these methods often fall short compared to the full-rank weight training approach, as they restrict the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. This limitation can disrupt training dynamics and require a full-rank warm start to mitigate the impact. In this paper, we introduce a new method inspired by a phenomenon we formally prove: as training progresses, the rank of the estimated layer gradients gradually decreases, and asymptotically approaches rank one. Leveraging this, our approach involves adaptively reducing the rank of the gradients during Adam optimization steps, using an efficient online-updating low-rank projections rule. We further present a randomized SVD scheme for efficiently finding the projection matrix. Our technique enables full-parameter fine-tuning with adaptive low-rank gradient updates, significantly reducing overall memory requirements during training compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving model performance in both pretraining and fine-tuning. Finally, we provide a convergence analysis of our method and demonstrate its merits for training and fine-tuning language and biological foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Layer Significance in LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17875v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) through fine-tuning is essential for tailoring them to specific applications. Therefore, understanding what LLMs learn during the alignment process is crucial. Recent studies suggest that alignment primarily adjusts a model's presentation style rather than its foundational knowledge, indicating that only certain components of the model are significantly impacted. To delve deeper into LLM alignment, we propose to identify which layers within LLMs are most critical to the alignment process, thereby uncovering how alignment influences model behavior at a granular level. We propose a novel approach to identify the important layers for LLM alignment (ILA). It involves learning a binary mask for each incremental weight matrix in the LoRA algorithm, indicating the significance of each layer. ILA consistently identifies important layers across various alignment datasets, with nearly 90% overlap even with substantial dataset differences, highlighting fundamental patterns in LLM alignment. Experimental results indicate that freezing non-essential layers improves overall model performance, while selectively tuning the most critical layers significantly enhances fine-tuning efficiency with minimal performance loss.</p></details> |  |

Practical Scheduling Techniques for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17840v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) improve throughput by processing several requests concurrently. However, multiplexing hardware resources between concurrent requests involves non-trivial scheduling decisions. Practical serving systems typically implement these decisions at two levels: First, a load balancer routes requests to different servers which each hold a replica of the LLM. Then, on each server, an engine-level scheduler decides when to run a request, or when to queue or preempt it. Improved scheduling policies may benefit a wide range of LLM deployments and can often be implemented as "drop-in replacements" to a system's current policy. In this work, we survey scheduling techniques from the literature and from practical serving systems. We find that schedulers from the literature often achieve good performance but introduce significant complexity. In contrast, schedulers in practical deployments often leave easy performance gains on the table but are easy to implement, deploy and configure. This finding motivates us to introduce two new scheduling techniques, which are both easy to implement, and outperform current techniques on production workload traces.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15956v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Debugging Approach via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17153v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software debugging is a time-consuming endeavor involving a series of steps, such as fault localization and patch generation, each requiring thorough analysis and a deep understanding of the underlying logic. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising potential in coding tasks, their performance in debugging remains limited. Current LLM-based methods often focus on isolated steps and struggle with complex bugs. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end framework, FixAgent, for unified debugging through multi-agent synergy. It mimics the entire cognitive processes of developers, with each agent specialized as a particular component of this process rather than mirroring the actions of an independent expert as in previous multi-agent systems. Agents are coordinated through a three-level design, following a cognitive model of debugging, allowing adaptive handling of bugs with varying complexities. Experiments on extensive benchmarks demonstrate that FixAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art repair methods, fixing 1.25$\times$ to 2.56$\times$ bugs on the repo-level benchmark, Defects4J. This performance is achieved without requiring ground-truth root-cause code statements, unlike the baselines.

However, traditional user studies used to evaluate these tools are often costly, time consuming, and difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human participants to help streamline XAI evaluation. We reproduce a user study comparing counterfactual and causal explanations, replicating human participants with seven LLMs under various settings. Our results show that (i) LLMs can replicate most conclusions from the original study, (ii) different LLMs yield varying levels of alignment in the results, and (iii) experimental factors such as LLM memory and output variability affect alignment with human responses. These initial findings suggest that LLMs could provide a scalable and cost-effective way to simplify qualitative XAI evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications, Wasm specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for utilizing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted, meaningful tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate the efficacy of DiffSpec on two different systems, namely, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 359 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, and undefined behavior when using the stack pointer. We also found 279 differentiating tests in Wasm validators, that point to at least 2 confirmed and fixed bugs in Wizard Engine.</p></details> |  |

We then propose a supervised approach that leverages labeled datasets to estimate the uncertainty in LLMs' responses. Based on the formulation, we illustrate the difference between the uncertainty estimation for LLMs and that for standard ML models and explain why the hidden neurons of the LLMs may contain uncertainty information. Our designed approach demonstrates the benefits of utilizing hidden activations to enhance uncertainty estimation across various tasks and shows robust transferability in out-of-distribution settings. We distinguish the uncertainty estimation task from the uncertainty calibration task and show that better uncertainty estimation leads to better calibration performance. Furthermore, our method is easy to implement and adaptable to different levels of model accessibility including black box, grey box, and white box.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

However, current reward models have limited generalization capabilities to unseen prompts and responses, which can lead to an unexpected phenomenon known as reward over-optimization, resulting in a decline in actual performance due to excessive optimization of rewards. While previous research has advocated for constraining policy optimization, our study introduces a novel approach to enhance the reward model's generalization ability against distribution shifts by regularizing the hidden states. Specifically, we retain the base model's language model head and incorporate a suite of text-generation losses to preserve the hidden states' text-generation capabilities, while concurrently learning a reward head behind the same hidden states. Our experimental results demonstrate that the introduced regularization technique markedly improves the accuracy of learned reward models across a variety of out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks and effectively alleviates the over-optimization issue in RLHF, offering a more reliable and robust preference learning paradigm.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes at https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

Through action research methodology, we developed and evaluated an AI-assisted approach utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus models to process data from 72 sports federation membership reports. The system achieved a 90% success rate in automated processing, successfully handling 65 of 72 files without errors and converting over 7,900 rows of data. While the initial development time was comparable to traditional manual processing (three months), the implemented system shows potential for reducing future processing time by approximately 90%. Key challenges included handling multilingual content, processing multi-page datasets, and managing extraneous information. The findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrate significant potential for automating semi-structured data processing tasks, optimal results are achieved through a hybrid approach combining AI automation with selective human oversight. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical LLM applications in organizational data management and provides insights into the transformation of traditional data processing workflows.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

ABV requires assertions, which are generally converted from specifications through human interpretation by verification engineers.

In this work, we present AssertLLM, an automatic assertion generation framework that processes complete specification documents. AssertLLM can generate assertions from both natural language and waveform diagrams in specification files. It first converts unstructured specification sentences and waveforms into structured descriptions using natural language templates.

This leads to the need for meta-evaluation: evaluating the credibility of LLMs as evaluators. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on English, offering limited insight into LLMs' effectiveness as evaluators in non-English contexts. To address this, we introduce MM-Eval, a multilingual meta-evaluation benchmark that covers 18 languages across six categories. MM-Eval evaluates various dimensions, including language-specific challenges like linguistics and language hallucinations. Evaluation results show that both proprietary and open-source language models have considerable room for improvement. Further analysis reveals a tendency for these models to assign middle-ground scores to low-resource languages. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | work in progress |

It is becoming popular in enterprise settings for daily business operations. For example, Copilot for Microsoft 365 has accumulated millions of businesses. However, the security implications of adopting such RAG-based systems are unclear. In this paper, we introduce ConfusedPilot, a class of security vulnerabilities of RAG systems that confuse Copilot and cause integrity and confidentiality violations in its responses. First, we investigate a vulnerability that embeds malicious text in the modified prompt in RAG, corrupting the responses generated by the LLM. Second, we demonstrate a vulnerability that leaks secret data, which leverages the caching mechanism during retrieval. Third, we investigate how both vulnerabilities can be exploited to propagate misinformation within the enterprise and ultimately impact its operations, such as sales and manufacturing. We also discuss the root cause of these attacks by investigating the architecture of a RAG-based system. This study highlights the security vulnerabilities in today's RAG-based systems and proposes design guidelines to secure future RAG-based systems.</p></details> |  |

This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real-ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real-ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model-based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes are released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model. GenIR, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation & filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images. Our second contribution, DreamClear, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address. Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/DreamClear.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, images captured by high-mobility UAVs often suffer from motion blur cases, which significantly impedes the performance of advanced object detection algorithms. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative object detection algorithm specifically designed for blurry images, named DREB-Net (Dual-stream Restoration Embedding Blur-feature Fusion Network). First, DREB-Net addresses the particularities of blurry image object detection problem by incorporating a Blurry image Restoration Auxiliary Branch (BRAB) during the training phase. Second, it fuses the extracted shallow features via Multi-level Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (MAGFF) module, to extract richer features. Here, the MAGFF module comprises local attention modules and global attention modules, which assign different weights to the branches. Then, during the inference phase, the deep feature extraction of the BRAB can be removed to reduce computational complexity and improve detection speed. In loss function, a combined loss of MSE and SSIM is added to the BRAB to restore blurry images. Finally, DREB-Net introduces Fast Fourier Transform in the early stages of feature extraction, via a Learnable Frequency domain Amplitude Modulation Module (LFAMM), to adjust feature amplitude and enhance feature processing capability. Experimental results indicate that DREB-Net can still effectively perform object detection tasks under motion blur in captured images, showcasing excellent performance and broad application prospects. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/EEIC-Lab/DREB-Net.git.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |

Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

| **[LoRA-IR: Taming Low-Rank Experts for Efficient All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15385v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-based all-in-one image restoration (IR) frameworks have achieved remarkable performance by incorporating degradation-specific information into prompt modules. Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 image restoration tasks and 29 benchmarks. Code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/shallowdream204/LoRA-IR.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level. Related source codes and pre-trained parameters were public in https://github.com/puppy210/DaLPSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15067v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) refers to the process of improving visual quality of images while removing degradation, such as noise, blur, weather effects, and so on. Traditional IR methods typically target specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance both convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this review, we delve into the AiOIR methodologies, emphasizing their architecture innovations and learning paradigm and offering a systematic review of prevalent approaches. We systematically categorize prevalent approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to advance this dynamic field. Our paper begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of cutting-edge designs based on factors such as prior knowledge and generalization capability. Next, we highlight key advancements in AiOIR, aiming to inspire further inquiry and innovation within the community. To facilitate a robust evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize commonly used datasets, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

| **[Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08881v2)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with fine-tuning only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Performance of a GPU- and Time-Efficient Pseudo 3D Network for Magnetic Resonance Image Super-Resolution and Motion Artifact Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14259v5)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shortening acquisition time and reducing motion artifacts are the most critical challenges in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Deep learning-based image restoration has emerged as a promising solution capable of generating high-resolution and motion-artifact-free MRI images from low-resolution images acquired with shortened acquisition times or from motion-artifact-corrupted images. To facilitate clinical integration, a time- and GPU-efficient network with reliable accuracy is essential. In this study, we adopted a unified 2D deep learning framework for pseudo-3D MRI image super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) and motion artifact reduction (MAR). The optimal down-sampling factors to optimize the acquisition time in SRR were identified. Training for MAR was performed using publicly available in vivo data, employing a novel standardized method to induce motion artifacts of varying severity in a controlled way. The accuracy of the network was evaluated through a pixel-wise uncertainty map, and performance was benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrated that the down-sampling factor of 1x1x2 for x2 acceleration and 2x2x2 for x4 acceleration was optimal. For SRR, the proposed TS-RCAN outperformed the 3D networks of mDCSRN and ReCNN, with an improvement of more than 0.01 in SSIM and 1.5 dB in PSNR while reducing GPU load by up to and inference time by up to 90%. For MAR, TS-RCAN exceeded UNet's performance by up to 0.014 in SSIM and 1.48 dB in PSNR. Additionally, TS-RCAN provided uncertainty information, which can be used to estimate the quality of the reconstructed images. TS-RCAN has potential use for SRR and MAR in the clinical setting.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fusion from Decomposition: A Self-Supervised Approach for Image Fusion and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12274v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image fusion is famous as an alternative solution to generate one high-quality image from multiple images in addition to image restoration from a single degraded image. The essence of image fusion is to integrate complementary information from source images. Existing fusion methods struggle with generalization across various tasks and often require labor-intensive designs, in which it is difficult to identify and extract useful information from source images due to the diverse requirements of each fusion task. Additionally, these methods develop highly specialized features for different downstream applications, hindering the adaptation to new and diverse downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFusion++, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to enhance the versatility of feature representation for different image fusion tasks. DeFusion++ captures the image fusion task-friendly representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way, overcoming the constraints of limited fusion datasets. Specifically, we introduce two innovative pretext tasks: common and unique decomposition (CUD) and masked feature modeling (MFM). CUD decomposes source images into abstract common and unique components, while MFM refines these components into robust fused features. Jointly training of these tasks enables DeFusion++ to produce adaptable representations that can effectively extract useful information from various source images, regardless of the fusion task. The resulting fused representations are also highly adaptable for a wide range of downstream tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. DeFusion++ stands out by producing versatile fused representations that can enhance both the quality of image fusion and the effectiveness of downstream high-level vision tasks, simplifying the process with the elegant fusion framework.</p></details> | 18page |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, dehazing, deblurring, desonwing, and deraining.

However, efforts to extend these advancements to video scenarios have been minimal, partly because of the absence of benchmarks that allow for a comprehensive and fair comparison. In this work, we first present a fair evaluation benchmark, in which we first introduce a Real-world Low-Quality Face Video benchmark (RFV-LQ), evaluate several leading image-based face restoration algorithms, and conduct a thorough systematical analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with extending blind face image restoration algorithms to degraded face videos. Our analysis identifies several key issues, primarily categorized into two aspects: significant jitters in facial components and noise-shape flickering between frames. To address these issues, we propose a Temporal Consistency Network (TCN) cooperated with alignment smoothing to reduce jitters and flickers in restored videos. TCN is a flexible component that can be seamlessly plugged into the most advanced face image restoration algorithms, ensuring the quality of image-based restoration is maintained as closely as possible.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

Existing deep models, tailored for specific individual image restoration tasks, often fall short in effectively addressing these challenges. In this paper, we present a new problem called general image restoration (GIR) which aims to address these challenges within a unified model. GIR covers most individual image restoration tasks (\eg, image denoising, deblurring, deraining and super-resolution) and their combinations for general purposes. This paper proceeds to delineate the essential aspects of GIR, including problem definition and the overarching significance of generalization performance. Moreover, the establishment of new datasets and a thorough evaluation framework for GIR models is discussed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing approaches for tackling the GIR challenge, illuminating their strengths and pragmatic challenges. By analyzing these approaches, we not only underscore the effectiveness of GIR but also highlight the difficulties in its practical implementation.

| **[Dynamic Pre-training: Towards Efficient and Scalable All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02154v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tackles different types of degradations with a unified model instead of having task-specific, non-generic models for each degradation. The requirement to tackle multiple degradations using the same model can lead to high-complexity designs with fixed configuration that lack the adaptability to more efficient alternatives. We propose DyNet, a dynamic family of networks designed in an encoder-decoder style for all-in-one image restoration tasks. Our DyNet can seamlessly switch between its bulkier and lightweight variants, thereby offering flexibility for efficient model deployment with a single round of training. This seamless switching is enabled by our weights-sharing mechanism, forming the core of our architecture and facilitating the reuse of initialized module weights. Further, to establish robust weights initialization, we introduce a dynamic pre-training strategy that trains variants of the proposed DyNet concurrently, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GPU hours. Our dynamic pre-training strategy eliminates the need for maintaining separate checkpoints for each variant, as all models share a common set of checkpoints, varying only in model depth. This efficient strategy significantly reduces storage overhead and enhances adaptability. To tackle the unavailability of large-scale dataset required in pre-training, we curate a high-quality, high-resolution image dataset named Million-IRD, having 2M image samples. We validate our DyNet for image denoising, deraining, and dehazing in all-in-one setting, achieving state-of-the-art results with 31.34\% reduction in GFlops and a 56.75\% reduction in parameters compared to baseline models. The source codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/akshaydudhane16/DyNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updates where the DyNet variants now share the same weights during inference as well, eliminating the need to store separate weights and thereby reducing device storage requirements.

| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous works typically targeting isolated degradation types, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations which involve a complex interplay of multiple different isolated degradations. Recognizing the challenges posed by the exponential number of possible degradation combinations, we propose Universal Image Restoration (UIR), a new task setting that requires models to be trained on a set of degradation bases and then remove any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought which prompts LLMs to address problems step-by-step, we propose the Chain-of-Restoration (CoR), which instructs models to step-by-step remove unknown composite degradations. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR significantly improves model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving results comparable to or surpassing those of State-of-The-Art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations. The code will be released at https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[TANet: Triplet Attention Network for All-In-One Adverse Weather Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08177v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adverse weather image restoration aims to remove unwanted degraded artifacts, such as haze, rain, and snow, caused by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods achieve remarkable results for addressing single-weather conditions. However, they face challenges when encountering unpredictable weather conditions, which often happen in real-world scenarios. Although different weather conditions exhibit different degradation patterns, they share common characteristics that are highly related and complementary, such as occlusions caused by degradation patterns, color distortion, and contrast attenuation due to the scattering of atmospheric particles. Therefore, we focus on leveraging common knowledge across multiple weather conditions to restore images in a unified manner. In this paper, we propose a Triplet Attention Network (TANet) to efficiently and effectively address all-in-one adverse weather image restoration. TANet consists of Triplet Attention Block (TAB) that incorporates three types of attention mechanisms: Local Pixel-wise Attention (LPA) and Global Strip-wise Attention (GSA) to address occlusions caused by non-uniform degradation patterns, and Global Distribution Attention (GDA) to address color distortion and contrast attenuation caused by atmospheric phenomena. By leveraging common knowledge shared across different weather conditions, TANet successfully addresses multiple weather conditions in a unified manner. Experimental results show that TANet efficiently and effectively achieves state-of-the-art performance in all-in-one adverse weather image restoration.

Despite the impressive results achieved by these I2I models, their practical utility is hampered by their large model size and the computational burden of the iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel compression method tailored for diffusion-based I2I models. Based on the observations that the image conditions of I2I models already provide rich information on image structures, and that the time steps with a larger impact tend to be biased, we develop surprisingly simple yet effective approaches for reducing the model size and latency. We validate the effectiveness of our method on three representative I2I tasks: InstructPix2Pix for image editing, StableSR for image restoration, and ControlNet for image-conditional image generation. Our approach achieves satisfactory output quality with 39.2%, 56.4% and 39.2% reduction in model footprint, as well as 81.4%, 68.7% and 31.1% decrease in latency to InstructPix2Pix, StableSR and ControlNet, respectively.</p></details> | ACCV 2024 |

An effective strategy is to incorporate prior knowledge, either from human input or generative model. In this paper, we introduce Instant-reference Image Restoration (InstantIR), a novel diffusion-based BIR method which dynamically adjusts generation condition during inference. We first extract a compact representation of the input via a pre-trained vision encoder. At each generation step, this representation is used to decode current diffusion latent and instantiate it in the generative prior. The degraded image is then encoded with this reference, providing robust generation condition. We observe the variance of generative references fluctuate with degradation intensity, which we further leverage as an indicator for developing a sampling algorithm adaptive to input quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate InstantIR achieves state-of-the-art performance and offering outstanding visual quality. Through modulating generative references with textual description, InstantIR can restore extreme degradation and additionally feature creative restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attentive Fine-Grained Structured Sparsity for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12266v3)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration tasks have witnessed great performance improvement in recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has restricted the application of image restoration. To lift the restriction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N:M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efficient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for different computational complexities and performance requirements for different layers of an image restoration network. To further optimize the trade-off between the efficiency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our method which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly. PyTorch implementation for the proposed methods is available at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2022</p></details> |

However, existing LRMs often suffer from the hallucination dilemma, i.e., producing incorrect contents or textures when dealing with severe degradations, due to their heavy reliance on limited internal knowledge. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal solution called the Retrieval-augmented Framework for Image Restoration (ReFIR), which incorporates retrieved images as external knowledge to extend the knowledge boundary of existing LRMs in generating details faithful to the original scene. Specifically, we first introduce the nearest neighbor lookup to retrieve content-relevant high-quality images as reference, after which we propose the cross-image injection to modify existing LRMs to utilize high-quality textures from retrieved images. Thanks to the additional external knowledge, our ReFIR can well handle the hallucination challenge and facilitate faithfully results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReFIR can achieve not only high-fidelity but also realistic restoration results. Importantly, our ReFIR requires no training and is adaptable to various LRMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learning Efficient and Effective Trajectories for Differential Equation-based Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04811v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differential equation-based image restoration approach aims to establish learnable trajectories connecting high-quality images to a tractable distribution, e.g., low-quality images or a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

| **[SITCOM: Step-wise Triple-Consistent Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04479v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative models that allow sampling from a distribution learned over a training set. When applied to solving inverse imaging problems (IPs), the reverse sampling steps of DMs are typically modified to approximately sample from a measurement-conditioned distribution in the image space. However, these modifications may be unsuitable for certain settings (such as in the presence of measurement noise) and non-linear tasks, as they often struggle to correct errors from earlier sampling steps and generally require a large number of optimization and/or sampling steps. To address these challenges, we state three conditions for achieving measurement-consistent diffusion trajectories. Building on these conditions, we propose a new optimization-based sampling method that not only enforces the standard data manifold measurement consistency and forward diffusion consistency, as seen in previous studies, but also incorporates backward diffusion consistency that maintains a diffusion trajectory by optimizing over the input of the pre-trained model at every sampling step. By enforcing these conditions, either implicitly or explicitly, our sampler requires significantly fewer reverse steps. Therefore, we refer to our accelerated method as Step-wise Triple-Consistent Sampling (SITCOM). Compared to existing state-of-the-art baseline methods, under different levels of measurement noise, our extensive experiments across five linear and three non-linear image restoration tasks demonstrate that SITCOM achieves competitive or superior results in terms of standard image similarity metrics while requiring a significantly reduced run-time across all considered tasks.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we tackle a variety of vision tasks into a unified image-text-to-image generation framework and curate an Omni Pixel-to-Pixel Instruction-Tuning Dataset. By constructing detailed instruction templates in natural language, we comprehensively include a large set of diverse vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, image restoration, image grounding, dense image prediction, image editing, controllable generation, inpainting/outpainting, and more. Furthermore, we adopt Diffusion Transformers (DiT) as our foundation model and extend its capabilities with a flexible any resolution mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically process images based on the aspect ratio of the input, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also incorporates structure-aware and semantic-aware guidance to facilitate effective fusion of information from the input image.

Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 23,000 high-resolution facial images across 5,000 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images.</p></details> | 23 Pages, 28 Figures |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining.

| **[Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03463v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kangliao929.github.io/projects/noise-da/</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>url: ...</summary><p>url: https://github.com/GuoLanqing/Awesome-Shadow-Removal</p></details> |
| **[TransRef: Multi-Scale Reference Embedding Transformer for Reference-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11528v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting for completing complicated semantic environments and diverse hole patterns of corrupted images is challenging even for state-of-the-art learning-based inpainting methods trained on large-scale data. A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking and Defending Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pretrained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to mitigate this issue but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic defense framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic meanings in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers fundamental shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its superiority over existing purification methods and stronger robustness against adaptive perturbation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Posterior sampling via Langevin dynamics based on generative priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02078v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling in high-dimensional spaces using generative models holds significant promise for various applications, including but not limited to inverse problems and guided generation tasks. Despite many recent developments, generating diverse posterior samples remains a challenge, as existing methods require restarting the entire generative process for each new sample, making the procedure computationally expensive. In this work, we propose efficient posterior sampling by simulating Langevin dynamics in the noise space of a pre-trained generative model. By exploiting the mapping between the noise and data spaces which can be provided by distilled flows or consistency models, our method enables seamless exploration of the posterior without the need to re-run the full sampling chain, drastically reducing computational overhead. Theoretically, we prove a guarantee for the proposed noise-space Langevin dynamics to approximate the posterior, assuming that the generative model sufficiently approximates the prior distribution. Our framework is experimentally validated on image restoration tasks involving noisy linear and nonlinear forward operators applied to LSUN-Bedroom (256 x 256) and ImageNet (64 x 64) datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach generates high-fidelity samples with enhanced semantic diversity even under a limited number of function evaluations, offering superior efficiency and performance compared to existing diffusion-based posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00418v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Currently, CNN-transformer hybrid models provide state-of-the-art performance for these tasks. The key common ingredient in the architectural designs of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show that CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided Low-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable computational gain while closely retaining the original model performance. Unique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for both short and long input sequences. In particular, the gain is in terms of both Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and parameter count reduction. This is in contrast to the existing popular computational complexity reduction techniques, e.g., Linformer, Performer, and Reformer, for whom FLOPs overpower the efficient design tricks for the shorter input sequences. Moreover, parameter reduction remains unaccounted for in the existing methods.We perform an extensive evaluation for the tasks of spectral reconstruction from RGB images, spectral reconstruction from snapshot compressive imaging, motion deblurring, and image deraining by enhancing the best-performing models with our GLMHA. Our results show up to a 7.7 Giga FLOPs reduction with 370K fewer parameters required to closely retain the original performance of the best-performing models that employ CSA.</p></details> |  |

Despite performing effectively compared to single degradation restoration methods, they overlook the utilization of commonalities and specificities within multi-task restoration, thereby impeding the model's performance. Inspired by the success of deep generative models and fine-tuning techniques, we proposed a universal image restoration framework based on multiple low-rank adapters (LoRA) from multi-domain transfer learning. Our framework leverages the pre-trained generative model as the shared component for multi-degradation restoration and transfers it to specific degradation image restoration tasks using low-rank adaptation. Additionally, we introduce a LoRA composing strategy based on the degradation similarity, which adaptively combines trained LoRAs and enables our model to be applicable for mixed degradation restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple and mixed degradations demonstrate that the proposed universal image restoration method not only achieves higher fidelity and perceptual image quality but also has better generalization ability than other unified image restoration models.

However, these approaches often incur substantial memory requirements, particularly when processing ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. In this paper, we propose a novel image restoration method called MixNet, which introduces an alternative approach to global modeling approaches and is more effective for UHD image restoration. To capture the longrange dependency of features without introducing excessive computational complexity, we present the Global Feature Modulation Layer (GFML). GFML associates features from different views by permuting the feature maps, enabling efficient modeling of long-range dependency. In addition, we also design the Local Feature Modulation Layer (LFML) and Feed-forward Layer (FFL) to capture local features and transform features into a compact representation. This way, our MixNetachieves effective restoration with low inference time overhead and computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on four UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, underwater image enhancement, image deblurring and image demoireing, and the comprehensive results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a simple pipeline for all-in-one blind image restoration to Restore Anything with Masks (RAM). We focus on the image content by utilizing Mask Image Modeling to extract intrinsic image information rather than distinguishing degradation types like other methods. Our pipeline consists of two stages: masked image pre-training and fine-tuning with mask attribute conductance. We design a straightforward masking pre-training approach specifically tailored for all-in-one image restoration. This approach enhances networks to prioritize the extraction of image content priors from various degradations, resulting in a more balanced performance across different restoration tasks and achieving stronger overall results. To bridge the gap of input integrity while preserving learned image priors as much as possible, we selectively fine-tuned a small portion of the layers. Specifically, the importance of each layer is ranked by the proposed Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC), and the layers with higher contributions are selected for finetuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

The Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^2$SB) presents a promising alternative by starting the generative process from corrupted images and leveraging training techniques from score-based diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB reconfigures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image into each step, while ensuring that the marginal distribution aligns with that of I$^2$SB. This allows for the direct use of the pretrained network from I$^2$SB. Extensive experiments on natural images, human face images, and medical images validate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining equal or improved fidelity to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, modeling the degradations in the sRGB domain is complicated because of the Image Signal Processor (ISP) transformations. Despite of this known issue, very few methods in the literature work directly with sensor RAW images. In this work we tackle image restoration directly in the RAW domain. We design a new realistic degradation pipeline for training deep blind RAW restoration models. Our pipeline considers realistic sensor noise, motion blur, camera shake, and other common degradations. The models trained with our pipeline and data from multiple sensors, can successfully reduce noise and blur, and recover details in RAW images captured from different cameras. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most exhaustive analysis on RAW image restoration.

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

However, existing methods tend to degrade on double JPEG images, which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Offset-Aware Partition Transformer for double JPEG artifacts removal, termed as OAPT. We conduct an analysis of double JPEG compression that results in up to four patterns within each 8x8 block and design our model to cluster the similar patterns to remedy the difficulty of restoration. Our OAPT consists of two components: compression offset predictor and image reconstructor. Specifically, the predictor estimates pixel offsets between the first and second compression, which are then utilized to divide different patterns. The reconstructor is mainly based on several Hybrid Partition Attention Blocks (HPAB), combining vanilla window-based self-attention and sparse attention for clustered pattern features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OAPT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 0.16dB in double JPEG image restoration task. Moreover, without increasing any computation cost, the pattern clustering module in HPAB can serve as a plugin to enhance other transformer-based image restoration methods.

Existing depth estimation systems, however, suffer inevitably from real-world corruptions and perturbations and are struggled to provide reliable depth predictions under such cases. In this paper, we summarize the winning solutions from the RoboDepth Challenge -- an academic competition designed to facilitate and advance robust OoD depth estimation. This challenge was developed based on the newly established KITTI-C and NYUDepth2-C benchmarks. We hosted two stand-alone tracks, with an emphasis on robust self-supervised and robust fully-supervised depth estimation, respectively. Out of more than two hundred participants, nine unique and top-performing solutions have appeared, with novel designs ranging from the following aspects: spatial- and frequency-domain augmentations, masked image modeling, image restoration and super-resolution, adversarial training, diffusion-based noise suppression, vision-language pre-training, learned model ensembling, and hierarchical feature enhancement. Extensive experimental analyses along with insightful observations are drawn to better understand the rationale behind each design. We hope this challenge could lay a solid foundation for future research on robust and reliable depth estimation and beyond.

| **[Lightweight single-image super-resolution network based on dual paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06590v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The single image super-resolution(SISR) algorithms under deep learning currently have two main models, one based on convolutional neural networks and the other based on Transformer. The former uses the stacking of convolutional layers with different convolutional kernel sizes to design the model, which enables the model to better extract the local features of the image; the latter uses the self-attention mechanism to design the model, which allows the model to establish long-distance dependencies between image pixel points through the self-attention mechanism and then better extract the global features of the image. However, both of the above methods face their problems. Based on this, this paper proposes a new lightweight multi-scale feature fusion network model based on two-way complementary convolutional and Transformer, which integrates the respective features of Transformer and convolutional neural networks through a two-branch network architecture, to realize the mutual fusion of global and local information. Meanwhile, considering the partial loss of information caused by the low-pixel images trained by the deep neural network, this paper designs a modular connection method of multi-stage feature supplementation to fuse the feature maps extracted from the shallow stage of the model with those extracted from the deep stage of the model, to minimize the loss of the information in the feature images that is beneficial to the image restoration as much as possible, to facilitate the obtaining of a higher-quality restored image. The practical results finally show that the model proposed in this paper is optimal in image recovery performance when compared with other lightweight models with the same amount of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception-Distortion Balanced Super-Resolution: A Multi-Objective Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15408v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High perceptual quality and low distortion degree are two important goals in image restoration tasks such as super-resolution (SR). Most of the existing SR methods aim to achieve these goals by minimizing the corresponding yet conflicting losses, such as the $\ell_1$ loss and the adversarial loss. Unfortunately, the commonly used gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, are hard to balance these objectives due to the opposite gradient decent directions of the contradictory losses. In this paper, we formulate the perception-distortion trade-off in SR as a multi-objective optimization problem and develop a new optimizer by integrating the gradient-free evolutionary algorithm (EA) with gradient-based Adam, where EA and Adam focus on the divergence and convergence of the optimization directions respectively. As a result, a population of optimal models with different perception-distortion preferences is obtained. We then design a fusion network to merge these models into a single stronger one for an effective perception-distortion trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that with the same backbone network, the perception-distortion balanced SR model trained by our method can achieve better perceptual quality than its competitors while attaining better reconstruction fidelity.

Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The conclusion about reconstruction performance with the size of the latent variable is not stable, we must validate it before presenting it to other researchers</p></details> |

In recent years supervised learning approaches have become a popular strategy attempting to tackle this task. Unfortunately, most supervised learning-based methods are highly demanding in terms of computational resources and training data (sample complexity). In addition, trained models are sensitive to domain changes, such as varying acquisition systems, signal sampling rates, resolution and contrast. In this work, we try to answer a fundamental question: Can supervised learning models generalize well solely by learning from one image or even part of an image? If so, then what is the minimal amount of patches required to achieve acceptable generalization? To this end, we focus on an efficient patch-based learning framework that requires a single image input-output pair for training. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach for supervised image deblurring and super-resolution. Our results showcase significant improvement of learning models' sample efficiency, generalization and time complexity, that can hopefully be leveraged for future real-time applications, and applied to other signals and modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.14267</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, challenges such as image noise, photobleaching of fluorophores, and low tolerability of biological samples to high light doses remain, restricting temporal resolutions and experiment durations. Reduced laser doses enable longer measurements at the cost of lower resolution and increased noise, which hinders accurate downstream analyses. Here we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to predict high-resolution images by conditioning the model on low-resolution information. Additionally, the probabilistic aspect of the DDPM allows for repeated generation of images that tend to further increase the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that our model achieves a performance that is better or similar to the previously best-performing methods, across four highly diverse datasets. Importantly, while any of the previous methods show competitive performance for some, but not all datasets, our method consistently achieves high performance across all four data sets, suggesting high generalizability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation to develop empirically effective algorithms for image restoration. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments over multiple datasets across several restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Restoration by Residual Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07319v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based image restoration (IR) methods have achieved remarkable success, they are still limited by the low inference speed attributed to the necessity of executing hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques, though seeking to expedite the process, inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, resulting in over-blurry restored outcomes. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling.Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance than state-of-the-art plug-and-play methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.</p></details> |  |

Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model.

Many end-to-end specialized models based on deep learning (DL) have been proposed, yet the scale and performance of these models are limited by the size of dataset. Given the superior parameter scales and feature representations of pre-trained models, they exhibit outstanding performance when transferred to downstream tasks with small datasets. Therefore, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method, namely PanAdapter, which utilizes additional advanced semantic information from pre-trained models to alleviate the issue of small-scale datasets in pansharpening tasks. Specifically, targeting the large domain discrepancy between image restoration and pansharpening tasks, the PanAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy for progressively adapting to the downstream task. In the first stage, we fine-tune the pre-trained CNN model and extract task-specific priors at two scales by proposed Local Prior Extraction (LPE) module. In the second stage, we feed the extracted two-scale priors into two branches of cascaded adapters respectively. At each adapter, we design two parameter-efficient modules for allowing the two branches to interact and be injected into the frozen pre-trained VisionTransformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that by only training the proposed LPE modules and adapters with a small number of parameters, our approach can benefit from pre-trained image restoration models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in several benchmark pansharpening datasets. The code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Weather Image Restoration via Histogram-Based Transformer Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06334v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the mainstream restoration tasks under adverse weather conditions have predominantly focused on single-weather scenarios. However, in reality, multiple weather conditions always coexist and their degree of mixing is usually unknown. Under such complex and diverse weather conditions, single-weather restoration models struggle to meet practical demands. This is particularly critical in fields such as autonomous driving, where there is an urgent need for a model capable of effectively handling mixed weather conditions and enhancing image quality in an automated manner. In this paper, we propose a Task Sequence Generator module that, in conjunction with the Task Intra-patch Block, effectively extracts task-specific features embedded in degraded images. The Task Intra-patch Block introduces an external learnable sequence that aids the network in capturing task-specific information. Additionally, we employ a histogram-based transformer module as the backbone of our network, enabling the capture of both global and local dynamic range features. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.03249</p></details> |

Nevertheless, most of transformer-based models are strictly bounded by exorbitant memory occupancy. Our goal is to reduce the memory consumption of Swin Transformer and at the same time speed up the model during training process. Thus, we introduce AgileIR, group shifted attention mechanism along with window attention, which sparsely simplifies the model in architecture. We propose Group Shifted Window Attention (GSWA) to decompose Shift Window Multi-head Self Attention (SW-MSA) and Window Multi-head Self Attention (W-MSA) into groups across their attention heads, contributing to shrinking memory usage in back propagation. In addition to that, we keep shifted window masking and its shifted learnable biases during training, in order to induce the model interacting across windows within the channel. We also re-allocate projection parameters to accelerate attention matrix calculation, which we found a negligible decrease in performance. As a result of experiment, compared with our baseline SwinIR and other efficient quantization models, AgileIR keeps the performance still at 32.20 dB on Set5 evaluation dataset, exceeding other methods with tailor-made efficient methods and saves over 50% memory while a large batch size is employed.</p></details> |  |

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing marked improvements in resilience against typical adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

PLAI is completed by accurately detecting the electrical components and defects in the aerial images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the visible quality of aerial images is inevitably degraded by adverse weather like haze, rain, or snow, which are found to drastically decrease the detection accuracy in our research. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new task of Power Line Aerial Image Restoration under Adverse Weather (PLAIR-AW), which aims to recover clean and high-quality images from degraded images with bad weather thus improving detection performance for PLAI. In this context, we are the first to release numerous corresponding datasets, namely, HazeCPLID, HazeTTPLA, HazeInsPLAD for power line aerial image dehazing, RainCPLID, RainTTPLA, RainInsPLAD for power line aerial image deraining, SnowCPLID, SnowInsPLAD for power line aerial image desnowing, which are synthesized upon the public power line aerial image datasets of CPLID, TTPLA, InsPLAD following the mathematical models. Meanwhile, we select numerous state-of-the-art methods from image restoration community as the baseline methods for PLAIR-AW. At last, we conduct large-scale empirical experiments to evaluate the performance of baseline methods on the proposed datasets. The proposed datasets and trained models are available at https://github.com/ntuhubin/PLAIR-AW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04384v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Data-free distillation provides an alternative for allowing to learn a lightweight student model from a pre-trained teacher model without relying on the original training data. The existing data-free learning methods mainly optimize the models with the pseudo data generated by GANs or the real data collected from the Internet. However, they inevitably suffer from the problems of unstable training or domain shifts with the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel Data-free Distillation with Degradation-prompt Diffusion framework for multi-weather Image Restoration (D4IR). It replaces GANs with pre-trained diffusion models to avoid model collapse and incorporates a degradation-aware prompt adapter to facilitate content-driven conditional diffusion for generating domain-related images. Specifically, a contrast-based degradation prompt adapter is firstly designed to capture degradation-aware prompts from web-collected degraded images. Then, the collected unpaired clean images are perturbed to latent features of stable diffusion, and conditioned with the degradation-aware prompts to synthesize new domain-related degraded images for knowledge distillation. Experiments illustrate that our proposal achieves comparable performance to the model distilled with original training data, and is even superior to other mainstream unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world weather conditions often consist of a mixture of several weather types, and the degree of weather mixing in autonomous driving scenarios remains unknown. In the presence of complex and diverse weather conditions, a single weather removal model often encounters challenges in producing clear images from severe weather images. Therefore, there is a need for the development of multi-task severe weather removal models that can effectively handle mixed weather conditions and improve image quality in autonomous driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-task severe weather removal model that can effectively handle complex weather conditions in an adaptive manner. Our model incorporates a weather task sequence generator, enabling the self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on features specific to different weather types. To tackle the challenge of repairing large areas of weather degradation, we introduce Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) to increase the receptive field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive upsampling technique that effectively processes both the weather task information and underlying image features by selectively retaining relevant information. Our proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures and 2 table</p></details> |
| **[Perceptual-Distortion Balanced Image Super-Resolution is a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03179v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) models using pixel-based regression losses can achieve high distortion metrics scores (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), but often results in blurry images due to insufficient recovery of high-frequency details. Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

We formulate a semi-supervised learning framework employing vision-language models to enhance restoration performance across diverse adverse weather conditions in real-world settings. Our approach involves assessing image clearness and providing semantics using vision-language models on real data, serving as supervision signals for training restoration models. For clearness enhancement, we use real-world data, utilizing a dual-step strategy with pseudo-labels assessed by vision-language models and weather prompt learning. For semantic enhancement, we integrate real-world data by adjusting weather conditions in vision-language model descriptions while preserving semantic meaning. Additionally, we introduce an effective training strategy to bootstrap restoration performance. Our approach achieves superior results in real-world adverse weather image restoration, demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art works.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

However, their performance is limited due to the dependency of FT on stationary signals and its lack of capability to extract spatial-frequency properties. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), a unified spatial-frequency representation leveraging both spatial and frequency components simultaneously, making it ideal for processing non-stationary signals like images. Specifically, we introduce a Fractional Fourier Transformer (F2former), where we combine the classical fractional Fourier based Wiener deconvolution (F2WD) as well as a multi-branch encoder-decoder transformer based on a new fractional frequency aware transformer block (F2TB). We design F2TB consisting of a fractional frequency aware self-attention (F2SA) to estimate element-wise product attention based on important frequency components and a novel feed-forward network based on frequency division multiplexing (FM-FFN) to refine high and low frequency features separately for efficient latent clear image restoration. Experimental results for the cases of both motion deblurring as well as defocus deblurring show that the performance of our proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 21 figures |

By iterating over these prompts, Restorer can handle composite degradation in real-world scenarios without requiring additional training.Based on these designs, Restorer with one set of parameters demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to existing all-in-one and even single-task models.Additionally, Restorer is efficient during inference, suggesting the potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing learning-based point cloud upsampling methods are constrained by computational resources and batch processing strategies, which often require subdividing point clouds into smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, a low-cost scheme called Machine Unlearning forgets the private data remembered in the model. Specifically, given a private dataset and a trained neural network, we need to use e.g. pruning, fine-tuning, and gradient ascent to remove the influence of the private dataset on the neural network. Inspired by this, we try to use this concept to bridge the gap between the fields of image restoration and security, creating a new research idea. We propose the scene for the All-In-One model (a neural network that restores a wide range of degraded information), where a given dataset such as haze, or rain, is private and needs to be eliminated from the influence of it on the trained model. Notably, we find great challenges in this task to remove the influence of sensitive data while ensuring that the overall model performance remains robust, which is akin to directing a symphony orchestra without specific instruments while keeping the playing soothing. Here we explore a simple but effective approach: Instance-wise Unlearning through the use of adversarial examples and gradient ascent techniques. Our approach is a low-cost solution compared to the strategy of retraining the model from scratch, where the gradient ascent trick forgets the specified data and the performance of the adversarial sample maintenance model is robust. Through extensive experimentation on two popular unified image restoration models, we show that our approach effectively preserves knowledge of remaining data while unlearning a given degradation type.</p></details> |  |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |

We collect 2600 high-quality real-world images, each with detailed descriptive text, for training the model. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks and achieves excellent performance, demonstrated by higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), lower learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and higher structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) scores. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining LoRA with SDXL for advanced image restoration tasks, highlighting the potential of our approach in generating high-fidelity restored images.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, restoration over gaming content is not well studied by the general public. The discrepancy is mainly caused by the lack of ground-truth gaming training data that match the test cases. Due to the unique characteristics of gaming content, the common approach of generating pseudo training data by degrading the original HR images results in inferior restoration performance. In this work, we develop GameIR, a large-scale high-quality computer-synthesized ground-truth dataset to fill in the blanks, targeting at two different applications. The first is super-resolution with deferred rendering, to support the gaming solution of rendering and transferring LR images only and restoring HR images on the client side. We provide 19200 LR-HR paired ground-truth frames coming from 640 videos rendered at 720p and 1440p for this task. The second is novel view synthesis (NVS), to support the multiview gaming solution of rendering and transferring part of the multiview frames and generating the remaining frames on the client side. This task has 57,600 HR frames from 960 videos of 160 scenes with 6 camera views. In addition to the RGB frames, the GBuffers during the deferred rendering stage are also provided, which can be used to help restoration. Furthermore, we evaluate several SOTA super-resolution algorithms and NeRF-based NVS algorithms over our dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our ground-truth GameIR data in improving restoration performance for gaming content. Also, we test the method of incorporating the GBuffers as additional input information for helping super-resolution and NVS. We release our dataset and models to the general public to facilitate research on restoration methods over gaming content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Control for Diffusion Bridge in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16303v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration refers to the process of restoring a damaged low-quality image back to its corresponding high-quality image. Typically, we use convolutional neural networks to directly learn the mapping from low-quality images to high-quality images achieving image restoration. Recently, a special type of diffusion bridge model has achieved more advanced results in image restoration. It can transform the direct mapping from low-quality to high-quality images into a diffusion process, restoring low-quality images through a reverse process. However, the current diffusion bridge restoration models do not emphasize the idea of conditional control, which may affect performance. This paper introduces the ECDB model enhancing the control of the diffusion bridge with low-quality images as conditions. Moreover, in response to the characteristic of diffusion models having low denoising level at larger values of \(\bm t \), we also propose a Conditional Fusion Schedule, which more effectively handles the conditional feature information of various modules. Experimental results prove that the ECDB model has achieved state-of-the-art results in many image restoration tasks, including deraining, inpainting and super-resolution.

| **[Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limitations of task-specific and general image restoration methods for specific degradation have prompted the development of all-in-one image restoration techniques. However, the diversity of patterns among multiple degradation, along with the significant uncertainties in mapping between degraded images of different severities and their corresponding undistorted versions, pose significant challenges to the all-in-one restoration tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation. Specifically, Perceive-IR contains two stages: (1) prompt learning stage and (2) restoration stage. In the prompt learning stage, we leverage prompt learning to acquire a fine-grained quality perceiver capable of distinguishing three-tier quality levels by constraining the prompt-image similarity in the CLIP perception space. Subsequently, this quality perceiver and difficulty-adaptive perceptual loss are integrated as a quality-aware learning strategy to realize fine-grained quality control in restoration stage. For the restoration stage, a semantic guidance module (SGM) and compact feature extraction (CFE) are proposed to further promote the restoration process by utilizing the robust semantic information from the pre-trained large scale vision models and distinguishing degradation-specific features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Perceive-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in all-in-one image restoration tasks and exhibit superior generalization ability when dealing with unseen tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

MCGF establishes a joint optimization between image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion models. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a lightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific information. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature extraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for testing. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF achieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM24 workshop</p></details> |

However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.</p></details> |  |

In thiscontext, iterative proximal algorithms are widely used, enabling to handle non-smooth functions and linear operators. Recently, these algorithms have been paired with deep learning strategies, to further improve the estimate quality. In particular, proximal neural networks (PNNs) have been introduced, obtained by unrolling a proximal algorithm as for finding a MAP estimate, but over a fixed number of iterations, with learned linear operators and parameters. As PNNs are based on optimization theory, they are very flexible, and can be adapted to any image restoration task, as soon as a proximal algorithm can solve it. They further have much lighter architectures than traditional networks. In this article we propose a unified framework to build PNNs for the Gaussian denoising task, based on both the dual-FB and the primal-dual Chambolle-Pock algorithms. We further show that accelerated inertial versions of these algorithms enable skip connections in the associated NN layers. We propose different learning strategies for our PNN framework, and investigate their robustness (Lipschitz property) and denoising efficiency. Finally, we assess the robustness of our PNNs when plugged in a forward-backward algorithm for an image deblurring problem.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based inverse problem solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off, the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation, a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, published at the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, Vienna, Austria, 2024</p></details> |

In real-world scenarios, different types of degradation can cause the loss of image details at various scales and degrade image contrast. Existing methods predominantly rely on CNN and Transformer to capture multi-scale representations. However, these methods are often limited by the high computational complexity of Transformers and the constrained receptive field of CNN, which hinder them from achieving superior performance and efficiency in image restoration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multi-Scale State-Space Model-based (MS-Mamba) for efficient image restoration that enhances the capacity for multi-scale representation learning through our proposed global and regional SSM modules. Additionally, an Adaptive Gradient Block (AGB) and a Residual Fourier Block (RFB) are proposed to improve the network's detail extraction capabilities by capturing gradients in various directions and facilitating learning details in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on nine public benchmarks across four classic image restoration tasks, image deraining, dehazing, denoising, and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational complexity.

| **[Harnessing Multi-resolution and Multi-scale Attention for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09912v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater imagery is often compromised by factors such as color distortion and low contrast, posing challenges for high-level vision tasks. Recent underwater image restoration (UIR) methods either analyze the input image at full resolution, resulting in spatial richness but contextual weakness, or progressively from high to low resolution, yielding reliable semantic information but reduced spatial accuracy. Here, we propose a lightweight multi-stage network called Lit-Net that focuses on multi-resolution and multi-scale image analysis for restoring underwater images while retaining original resolution during the first stage, refining features in the second, and focusing on reconstruction in the final stage. Our novel encoder block utilizes parallel $1\times1$ convolution layers to capture local information and speed up operations. Further, we incorporate a modified weighted color channel-specific $l_1$ loss ($cl_1$) function to recover color and detail information. Extensive experimentations on publicly available datasets suggest our model's superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvement in qualitative and quantitative measures, such as $29.477$ dB PSNR ($1.92\%$ improvement) and $0.851$ SSIM ($2.87\%$ improvement) on the EUVP dataset. The contributions of Lit-Net offer a more robust approach to underwater image enhancement and super-resolution, which is of considerable importance for underwater autonomous vehicles and surveillance.

| **[Re-boosting Self-Collaboration Parallel Prompt GAN for Unsupervised Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09241v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised restoration approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution without requiring paired datasets. Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

| **[Multi-task Image Restoration Guided By Robust DINO Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01677v3)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task image restoration has gained significant interest due to its inherent versatility and efficiency compared to its single-task counterpart. However, performance decline is observed with an increase in the number of tasks, primarily attributed to the restoration model's challenge in handling different tasks with distinct natures at the same time. Thus, a perspective emerged aiming to explore the degradation-insensitive semantic commonalities among different degradation tasks. In this paper, we observe that the features of DINOv2 can effectively model semantic information and are independent of degradation factors. Motivated by this observation, we propose \mbox{\textbf{DINO-IR}}, a multi-task image restoration approach leveraging robust features extracted from DINOv2 to solve multi-task image restoration simultaneously. We first propose a pixel-semantic fusion (PSF) module to dynamically fuse DINOV2's shallow features containing pixel-level information and deep features containing degradation-independent semantic information. To guide the restoration model with the features of DINOv2, we develop a DINO-Restore adaption and fusion module to adjust the channel of fused features from PSF and then integrate them with the features from the restoration model. By formulating these modules into a unified deep model, we propose a DINO perception contrastive loss to constrain the model training. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DINO-IR performs favorably against existing multi-task image restoration approaches in various tasks by a large margin. The source codes and trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08149v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review Learning: Advancing All-in-One Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration Training Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06709v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All-in-one image restoration tasks are becoming increasingly important, especially for ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. Existing all-in-one UHD image restoration methods usually boost the model's performance by introducing prompt or customized dynamized networks for different degradation types. For the inference stage, it might be friendly, but in the training stage, since the model encounters multiple degraded images of different quality in an epoch, these cluttered learning objectives might be information pollution for the model. To address this problem, we propose a new training paradigm for general image restoration models, which we name \textbf{Review Learning}, which enables image restoration models to be capable enough to handle multiple types of degradation without prior knowledge and prompts. This approach begins with sequential training of an image restoration model on several degraded datasets, combined with a review mechanism that enhances the image restoration model's memory for several previous classes of degraded datasets. In addition, we design a lightweight all-purpose image restoration network that can efficiently reason about degraded images with 4K ($3840 \times 2160$) resolution on a single consumer-grade GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet based inpainting detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06429v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement in image editing tools, manipulating digital images has become alarmingly easy. Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in parts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and forgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting forgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with noise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this task, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor manipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which helps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency bands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then analyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can identify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with existing forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior results compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Optimal Transport: A Practical Algorithm for Photo-realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02342v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an image restoration algorithm that can control the perceptual quality and/or the mean square error (MSE) of any pre-trained model, trading one over the other at test time. Our algorithm is few-shot: Given about a dozen images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content images of arbitrary dimensions.</p></details> |  |

It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the unique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and their convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz method (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the matrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method converges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is consistent. The numerical tests verify the theoretical results and the methods presented in this paper are applied to the color image restoration problem to obtain satisfactory restored images.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities. While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution environments.

In this study, we empirically analyze LVLMs in long-context reasoning, revealing that increased context length leads to a higher dependence on language at the expense of visual dependency. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free context pruning method that selectively removes less critical textual information. Our approach enhances visual dependency and reduces textual noise, thereby improving LVLM performance in long-context reasoning. We validate our method by constructing a long-context dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness across various LVLMs. Moreover, further analysis confirms the robustness of different token pruning strategies and preliminary explores scaling laws between pruning rates and context length.</p></details> |  |

Using fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), quantized LoRA (QLoRA), and model pruning on models such as Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT-Video, we significantly enhance VLM performance in processing remote sensing temporal changes.

Yet, the depth of these advances in language-guided perception and abstract reasoning remains underexplored, and it is unclear whether these models can truly live up to their ambitious promises. To assess the progress and identify shortcomings, we enter the wonderland of Bongard problems, a set of classical visual reasoning puzzles that require human-like abilities of pattern recognition and abstract reasoning. While VLMs occasionally succeed in identifying discriminative concepts and solving some of the problems, they frequently falter, failing to understand and reason about visual concepts. Surprisingly, even elementary concepts that may seem trivial to humans, such as simple spirals, pose significant challenges. Moreover, even when asked to explicitly focus on and analyze these concepts, they continue to falter, suggesting not only a lack of understanding of these elementary visual concepts but also an inability to generalize to unseen concepts. These observations underscore the current limitations of VLMs, emphasize that a significant gap remains between human-like visual reasoning and machine cognition, and highlight the ongoing need for innovation in this area.</p></details> |  |

While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</p></details> |  |

Unlike the large language model (LLM)-based methods which rely on structured texts and customized backends, the approaches using large vision-language models (LVLMs) are more intuitive and adaptable as they can visually perceive and directly interact with screens, making them indispensable in general scenarios without text metadata and tailored backends. Given the lack of high-quality training data for GUI-related tasks in existing work, this paper aims to enhance the GUI understanding and interacting capabilities of LVLMs through a data-driven approach. We propose EDGE, a general data synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale, multi-granularity training data from webpages across the Web. Evaluation results on various GUI and agent benchmarks demonstrate that the model trained with the dataset generated through EDGE exhibits superior webpage understanding capabilities, which can then be easily transferred to previously unseen desktop and mobile environments. Our approach significantly reduces the dependence on manual annotations, empowering researchers to harness the vast public resources available on the Web to advance their work.

By using text as information supporting the visual query, the retrieval system gains in usability, but at the same time faces difficulties due to the diversity of visual signals that cannot be summarized by a short caption only. For this reason, as a matching-based task, cross-modal text-image retrieval often suffers from information asymmetry between texts and images. To address this challenge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Text-Image Retrieval (KTIR) method for remote sensing images. By mining relevant information from an external knowledge graph, KTIR enriches the text scope available in the search query and alleviates the information gaps between texts and images for better matching. Moreover, by integrating domain-specific knowledge, KTIR also enhances the adaptation of pre-trained vision-language models to remote sensing applications. Experimental results on three commonly used remote sensing text-image retrieval benchmarks show that the proposed knowledge-aware method leads to varied and consistent retrievals, outperforming state-of-the-art retrieval methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TGRS</p></details> |

Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) Dynamic Range Expansion, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by 1.54x compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a 1.43x end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training.

While optimizing prompts on downstream labeled data has proven effective in improving performance, these methods entail labor costs for annotations and are limited by their quality. Additionally, since CLIP is pre-trained on highly imbalanced Web-scale data, it suffers from inherent label bias that leads to suboptimal performance. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a label-Free prompt distribution learning and bias correction framework, dubbed as **Frolic**, which boosts zero-shot performance without the need for labeled data. Specifically, our Frolic learns distributions over prompt prototypes to capture diverse visual representations and adaptively fuses these with the original CLIP through confidence matching. This fused model is further enhanced by correcting label bias via a label-free logit adjustment. Notably, our method is not only training-free but also circumvents the necessity for hyper-parameter tuning. Extensive experimental results across 16 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly outperforming the state-of-the-art by an average of $2.6\%$ on 10 datasets with CLIP ViT-B/16 and achieving an average margin of $1.5\%$ on ImageNet and its five distribution shifts with CLIP ViT-B/16.

The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences.

This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) aims to address this challenge, allowing robots to interact with unknown objects without specific training data. Language-driven zero-shot object navigation (L-ZSON) is an extension of ZSON that incorporates natural language instructions to guide robot navigation and interaction with objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision Language model with a Tree-of-thought Network (VLTNet) for L-ZSON. VLTNet comprises four main modules: vision language model understanding, semantic mapping, tree-of-thought reasoning and exploration, and goal identification. Among these modules, Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning and exploration module serves as a core component, innovatively using the ToT reasoning framework for navigation frontier selection during robot exploration. Compared to conventional frontier selection without reasoning, navigation using ToT reasoning involves multi-path reasoning processes and backtracking when necessary, enabling globally informed decision-making with higher accuracy. Experimental results on PASTURE and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in LZSON, particularly in scenarios involving complex natural language as target instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) for Oral presentation</p></details> |

Using this data, we trained a 2-billion-parameter VLM, Aquila-VL-2B, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for models of similar scale.

However, identical semantic subjects, like people, boats, and houses, can vary significantly across different artistic traditions, indicating that style also encompasses the underlying semantics. Therefore, in this study, we propose a zero-shot scheme for image variation with coordinated semantics. Specifically, our scheme transforms the image-to-image problem into an image-to-text-to-image problem. The image-to-text operation employs vision-language models e.g., BLIP) to generate text describing the content of the input image, including the objects and their positions. Subsequently, the input style keyword is elaborated into a detailed description of this style and then merged with the content text using the reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT. Finally, the text-to-image operation utilizes a Diffusion model to generate images based on the text prompt. To enable the Diffusion model to accommodate more styles, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that injects text and style constraints into cross-attention. This ensures that the output image exhibits similar semantics in the desired style. To validate the performance of the proposed scheme, we constructed a benchmark comprising images of various styles and scenes and introduced two novel metrics. Despite its simplicity, our scheme yields highly plausible results in a zero-shot manner, particularly for generating stylized images with high-fidelity semantics.</p></details> | 13 pages,6 figures |

Previous works have proposed a variety of test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to achieve strong generalization without any knowledge of the target domain. However, existing training-required TTA approaches like TPT necessitate entropy minimization that involves large computational overhead, while training-free methods like TDA overlook the potential for information mining from the test samples themselves. In this paper, we break down the design of existing popular training-required and training-free TTA methods and bridge the gap between them within our framework. Specifically, we maintain a light-weight key-value memory for feature retrieval from instance-agnostic historical samples and instance-aware boosting samples. The historical samples are filtered from the testing data stream and serve to extract useful information from the target distribution, while the boosting samples are drawn from regional bootstrapping and capture the knowledge of the test sample itself. We theoretically justify the rationality behind our method and empirically verify its effectiveness on both the out-of-distribution and the cross-domain datasets, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[VHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07112v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: visual perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website (https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1). VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a model capable of successfully partitioning visual data can be obtained using only textual data. Based on the analysis, we propose Hassle-Free Textual Training (HFTT), a streamlined method capable of acquiring detectors for unwanted visual content, using only synthetic textual data in conjunction with pre-trained vision-language models. HFTT features an innovative objective function that significantly reduces the necessity for human involvement in data annotation. Furthermore, HFTT employs a clever textual data synthesis method, effectively emulating the integration of unknown visual data distribution into the training process at no extra cost. The unique characteristics of HFTT extend its utility beyond traditional out-of-distribution detection, making it applicable to tasks that address more abstract concepts. We complement our analyses with experiments in out-of-distribution detection and hateful image detection.

Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by - and even at odds with - the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03189v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt tuning for vision-language models such as CLIP involves optimizing the text prompts used to generate image-text pairs for specific downstream tasks. While hand-crafted or template-based prompts are generally applicable to a wider range of unseen classes, they tend to perform poorly in downstream tasks (i.e., seen classes). Learnable soft prompts, on the other hand, often perform well in downstream tasks but lack generalizability. Additionally, prior research has predominantly concentrated on the textual modality, with very few studies attempting to explore the prompt's generalization potential from the visual modality. Keeping these limitations in mind, we investigate how to prompt tuning to obtain both a competitive downstream performance and generalization. The study shows that by treating soft and hand-crafted prompts as dual views of the textual modality, and maximizing their mutual information, we can better ensemble task-specific and general semantic information. Moreover, to generate more expressive prompts, the study introduces a class-wise augmentation from the visual modality, resulting in significant robustness to a wider range of unseen classes. Extensive evaluations on several benchmarks report that the proposed approach achieves competitive results in terms of both task-specific performance and general abilities.</p></details> | in progress |
| **[Lightweight Neural App Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17883v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel mobile phone control architecture, termed ``app agents", for efficient interactions and controls across various Android apps. The proposed Lightweight Multi-modal App Control (LiMAC) takes as input a textual goal and a sequence of past mobile observations, such as screenshots and corresponding UI trees, to generate precise actions. To address the computational constraints inherent to smartphones, within LiMAC, we introduce a small Action Transformer (AcT) integrated with a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) for real-time decision-making and task execution. We evaluate LiMAC on two open-source mobile control datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our small-form-factor approach against fine-tuned versions of open-source VLMs, such as Florence2 and Qwen2-VL. It also significantly outperforms prompt engineering baselines utilising closed-source foundation models like GPT-4o. More specifically, LiMAC increases the overall action accuracy by up to 19% compared to fine-tuned VLMs, and up to 42% compared to prompt-engineering baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCKET-1: Master Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. A key issue is the difficulty in smoothly connecting individual entities in low-level observations with abstract concepts required for planning. A common approach to address this problem is through the use of hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language and imagined observations. However, language often fails to effectively convey spatial information, while generating future images with sufficient accuracy remains challenging. To address these limitations, we propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from both past and present observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, with real-time object tracking provided by SAM-2. Our method unlocks the full potential of VLMs visual-language reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex creative tasks, especially those heavily reliant on spatial understanding. Experiments in Minecraft demonstrate that our approach allows agents to accomplish previously unattainable tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of visual-temporal context prompting in embodied decision-making. Codes and demos will be available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1% training data.

RE-tune freezes the backbones and only trains simple adaptors on top of the Image and Text encoders of the VLM. By engineering positive and negative text prompts for diseases, we leverage the ability of Large Language Models to steer the training trajectory. We evaluate RE-tune in three realistic incremental learning scenarios: class-incremental, label-incremental, and data-incremental. Our results demonstrate that Biomedical VLMs are natural continual learners and prevent catastrophic forgetting. RE-tune not only achieves accurate multi-label classification results, but also prioritizes patient privacy and it distinguishes itself through exceptional computational efficiency, rendering it highly suitable for broad adoption in real-world healthcare settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at Medical Imaging meets NeurIPS (NeurIPS23)</p></details> |

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> |  |

This is typically achieved by using labeled datasets of chosen/rejected pairs and employing optimization algorithms like direct preference optimization (DPO). Existing visual alignment methods, primarily designed for single-image scenarios, struggle to effectively handle the complexity of multi-image tasks due to the scarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotating chosen/rejected pairs. We present Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), a visual preference alignment approach that effectively handles multi-image inputs. MIA-DPO mitigates the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images arranged in grid collages or pic-in-pic formats, significantly reducing the costs associated with multi-image data annotations. Our observation reveals that attention values of LVLMs vary considerably across different images. We use attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses the model may have mistakenly focused on. Our attention-aware selection for constructing the chosen/rejected pairs without relying on (i) human annotation, (ii) extra data, and (iii) external models or APIs. MIA-DPO is compatible with various architectures and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on the recent InternLM-XC2.5. Moreover, MIA-DPO has a minimal effect on the model's ability to understand single images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://github.com/Liuziyu77/MIA-DPO</p></details> |

We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments. Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of how different types of reward noise impact agent learning and highlight the importance of addressing multimodal reward signal noise when training embodied agents</p></details> | <details><summary>10 ma...</summary><p>10 main body pages, 11 appendix pages</p></details> |

Traditional VideoQA benchmarks, despite providing quantitative metrics, often fail to encompass the full spectrum of video content and inadequately assess models' temporal comprehension. To address these limitations, we introduce MMBench-Video, a quantitative benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LVLMs' proficiency in video understanding. MMBench-Video incorporates lengthy videos from YouTube and employs free-form questions, mirroring practical use cases. The benchmark is meticulously crafted to probe the models' temporal reasoning skills, with all questions human-annotated according to a carefully constructed ability taxonomy. We employ GPT-4 for automated assessment, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness over earlier LLM-based evaluations. Utilizing MMBench-Video, we have conducted comprehensive evaluations that include both proprietary and open-source LVLMs for images and videos. MMBench-Video stands as a valuable resource for the research community, facilitating improved evaluation of LVLMs and catalyzing progress in the field of video understanding.

However, despite their remarkable capabilities, the safety and security of these agents against malicious attacks remain critically underexplored, raising significant concerns about their safe deployment. To uncover and exploit such vulnerabilities in web agents, we provide AdvWeb, a novel black-box attack framework designed against web agents. AdvWeb trains an adversarial prompter model that generates and injects adversarial prompts into web pages, misleading web agents into executing targeted adversarial actions such as inappropriate stock purchases or incorrect bank transactions, actions that could lead to severe real-world consequences. With only black-box access to the web agent, we train and optimize the adversarial prompter model using DPO, leveraging both successful and failed attack strings against the target agent. Unlike prior approaches, our adversarial string injection maintains stealth and control: (1) the appearance of the website remains unchanged before and after the attack, making it nearly impossible for users to detect tampering, and (2) attackers can modify specific substrings within the generated adversarial string to seamlessly change the attack objective (e.g., purchasing stocks from a different company), enhancing attack flexibility and efficiency. We conduct extensive evaluations, demonstrating that AdvWeb achieves high success rates in attacking SOTA GPT-4V-based VLM agent across various web tasks. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current LLM/VLM-based agents, emphasizing the urgent need for developing more reliable web agents and effective defenses.

Evaluating Spatial Frame of Reference Under Ambiguities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17385v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial expressions in situated communication can be ambiguous, as their meanings vary depending on the frames of reference (FoR) adopted by speakers and listeners. While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Pluralistic Alignment @ NeurIPS 2024 | Project page: https://spatial-comfort.github.io/</p></details> |

As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or even thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the early layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss of crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we propose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating pyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a lightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance. Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for inference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower inference cost than counterparts. We hope that the insights and approach introduced by PyramidDrop will inspire future research to further investigate the role of image tokens in LVLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, are these models truly effective? In this work, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also find it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text corpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a semi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably evaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a $\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that yield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without using the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous benchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53 state-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like LLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o lag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is hard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires diverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings, object relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this end, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each NaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2) Biases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the same answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation method to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and non-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for dynamic evaluations of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 24; We open-source our dataset at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BaiqiL/NaturalBench ; Project page at: https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/naturalbench/</p></details> |

Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human-understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier.

In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX), which leverages the joint embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM) to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets.

Traditional methods typically assume static scenes, which limits their applicability in the continuously changing real world. To overcome these limitations, we present DovSG, a novel mobile manipulation framework that leverages dynamic open-vocabulary 3D scene graphs and a language-guided task planning module for long-term task execution. DovSG takes RGB-D sequences as input and utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) for object detection to obtain high-level object semantic features. Based on the segmented objects, a structured 3D scene graph is generated for low-level spatial relationships. Furthermore, an efficient mechanism for locally updating the scene graph, allows the robot to adjust parts of the graph dynamically during interactions without the need for full scene reconstruction. This mechanism is particularly valuable in dynamic environments, enabling the robot to continually adapt to scene changes and effectively support the execution of long-term tasks. We validated our system in real-world environments with varying degrees of manual modifications, demonstrating its effectiveness and superior performance in long-term tasks.

While traditional designs are laborious, intelligent generation technology offers efficiency gains and design enhancements. Despite exciting progress in image generation, current models often fall short in producing satisfactory poster results. The primary issue lies in the absence of specialized poster datasets for targeted model training. In this work, we propose a Movie Posters DataSet (MPDS), tailored for text-to-image generation models to revolutionize poster production. As dedicated to posters, MPDS stands out as the first image-text pair dataset to our knowledge, composing of 373k+ image-text pairs and 8k+ actor images (covering 4k+ actors). Detailed poster descriptions, such as movie titles, genres, casts, and synopses, are meticulously organized and standardized based on public movie synopsis, also named movie-synopsis prompt. To bolster poster descriptions as well as reduce differences from movie synopsis, further, we leverage a large-scale vision-language model to automatically produce vision-perceptive prompts for each poster, then perform manual rectification and integration with movie-synopsis prompt. In addition, we introduce a prompt of poster captions to exhibit text elements in posters like actor names and movie titles. For movie poster generation, we develop a multi-condition diffusion framework that takes poster prompt, poster caption, and actor image (for personalization) as inputs, yielding excellent results through the learning of a diffusion model. Experiments demonstrate the valuable role of our proposed MPDS dataset in advancing personalized movie poster generation. MPDS is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MPDS-373k-BD3B.</p></details> |  |

Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from large language models (LLMs). We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions. This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution. Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies.

| **[VipAct: Visual-Perception Enhancement via Specialized VLM Agent Collaboration and Tool-use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16400v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks combining textual and visual information, they continue to struggle with fine-grained visual perception tasks that require detailed pixel-level analysis. Effectively eliciting comprehensive reasoning from VLMs on such intricate visual elements remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present VipAct, an agent framework that enhances VLMs by integrating multi-agent collaboration and vision expert models, enabling more precise visual understanding and comprehensive reasoning. VipAct consists of an orchestrator agent, which manages task requirement analysis, planning, and coordination, along with specialized agents that handle specific tasks such as image captioning and vision expert models that provide high-precision perceptual information. This multi-agent approach allows VLMs to better perform fine-grained visual perception tasks by synergizing planning, reasoning, and tool use. We evaluate VipAct on benchmarks featuring a diverse set of visual perception tasks, with experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies reveal the critical role of multi-agent collaboration in eliciting more detailed System-2 reasoning and highlight the importance of image input for task planning. Additionally, our error analysis identifies patterns of VLMs' inherent limitations in visual perception, providing insights into potential future improvements. VipAct offers a flexible and extensible framework, paving the way for more advanced visual perception systems across various real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research on UI/UX automation often requires high-fidelity inputs like Figma designs or detailed screenshots, limiting accessibility and impeding efficient design iteration. To bridge this gap, we introduce Sketch2Code, a benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (VLMs) on automating the conversion of rudimentary sketches into webpage prototypes. Beyond end-to-end benchmarking, Sketch2Code supports interactive agent evaluation that mimics real-world design workflows, where a VLM-based agent iteratively refines its generations by communicating with a simulated user, either passively receiving feedback instructions or proactively asking clarification questions. We comprehensively analyze ten commercial and open-source models, showing that Sketch2Code is challenging for existing VLMs; even the most capable models struggle to accurately interpret sketches and formulate effective questions that lead to steady improvement. Nevertheless, a user study with UI/UX experts reveals a significant preference for proactive question-asking over passive feedback reception, highlighting the need to develop more effective paradigms for multi-turn conversational agents.</p></details> | preprint, 9 pages |

However, current training recipes lack robust CoT reasoning data, relying on datasets dominated by short annotations with minimal rationales. In this work, we show that training VLM on short answers does not generalize well to reasoning tasks that require more detailed responses. To address this, we propose a two-fold approach. First, we distill rationales from GPT-4o model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, boosting their CoT performance. Second, we apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Specifically, we construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs of model-generated reasoning chains, by comparing their predictions with annotated short answers. Using this pairwise data, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization algorithm to refine the model's reasoning abilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction as well. This work emphasizes the importance of incorporating detailed rationales in training and leveraging reinforcement learning to strengthen the reasoning capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages + appendix |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Composite Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much of the spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks (e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem). These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence. Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2024.

In digital pathology, vision-language models (VLM), pre-trained on curated datasets of histological image-captions, have been adapted to downstream tasks, such as region of interest classification. Zero-shot transfer for slide-level prediction has been formulated by MI-Zero, but it exhibits high variability depending on the textual prompts. Inspired by prototypical learning, we propose MI-VisionShot, a training-free adaptation method on top of VLMs to predict slide-level labels in few-shot learning scenarios. Our framework takes advantage of the excellent representation learning of VLM to create prototype-based classifiers under a multiple-instance setting by retrieving the most discriminative patches within each slide. Experimentation through different settings shows the ability of MI-VisionShot to surpass zero-shot transfer with lower variability, even in low-shot scenarios.

| **[Task-oriented Robotic Manipulation with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15863v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) play a crucial role in robotic manipulation by enabling robots to understand and interpret the visual properties of objects and their surroundings, allowing them to perform manipulation based on this multimodal understanding. However, understanding object attributes and spatial relationships is a non-trivial task but is critical in robotic manipulation tasks. In this work, we present a new dataset focused on spatial relationships and attribute assignment and a novel method to utilize VLMs to perform object manipulation with task-oriented, high-level input. In this dataset, the spatial relationships between objects are manually described as captions. Additionally, each object is labeled with multiple attributes, such as fragility, mass, material, and transparency, derived from a fine-tuned vision language model. The embedded object information from captions are automatically extracted and transformed into a data structure (in this case, tree, for demonstration purposes) that captures the spatial relationships among the objects within each image. The tree structures, along with the object attributes, are then fed into a language model to transform into a new tree structure that determines how these objects should be organized in order to accomplish a specific (high-level) task. We demonstrate that our method not only improves the comprehension of spatial relationships among objects in the visual environment but also enables robots to interact with these objects more effectively. As a result, this approach significantly enhances spatial reasoning in robotic manipulation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first method of its kind in the literature, offering a novel solution that allows robots to more efficiently organize and utilize objects in their surroundings.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient System for Automatic Map Storytelling -- A Case Study on Historical Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15780v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps provide valuable information and knowledge about the past. However, as they often feature non-standard projections, hand-drawn styles, and artistic elements, it is challenging for non-experts to identify and interpret them. While existing image captioning methods have achieved remarkable success on natural images, their performance on maps is suboptimal as maps are underrepresented in their pre-training process. Despite the recent advance of GPT-4 in text recognition and map captioning, it still has a limited understanding of maps, as its performance wanes when texts (e.g., titles and legends) in maps are missing or inaccurate. Besides, it is inefficient or even impractical to fine-tune the model with users' own datasets. To address these problems, we propose a novel and lightweight map-captioning counterpart. Specifically, we fine-tune the state-of-the-art vision-language model CLIP to generate captions relevant to historical maps and enrich the captions with GPT-3.5 to tell a brief story regarding where, what, when and why of a given map. We propose a novel decision tree architecture to only generate captions relevant to the specified map type. Our system shows invariance to text alterations in maps. The system can be easily adapted and extended to other map types and scaled to a larger map captioning system. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/claudaff/automatic-map-storytelling.</p></details> |  |

However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[CL-HOI: Cross-Level Human-Object Interaction Distillation from Vision Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15657v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has seen advancements with Vision Language Models (VLMs), but these methods often depend on extensive manual annotations. Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) can inherently recognize and reason about interactions at the image level but are computationally heavy and not designed for instance-level HOI detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Cross-Level HOI distillation (CL-HOI) framework, which distills instance-level HOIs from VLLMs image-level understanding without the need for manual annotations. Our approach involves two stages: context distillation, where a Visual Linguistic Translator (VLT) converts visual information into linguistic form, and interaction distillation, where an Interaction Cognition Network (ICN) reasons about spatial, visual, and context relations. We design contrastive distillation losses to transfer image-level context and interaction knowledge from the teacher to the student model, enabling instance-level HOI detection. Evaluations on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our CL-HOI surpasses existing weakly supervised methods and VLLM supervised methods, showing its efficacy in detecting HOIs without manual labels.</p></details> |  |

In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 284 datasets across 38 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 53.96%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub: https://github.com/uni-medical/GMAI-MMBench Hugging face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenGVLab/GMAI-MMBench</p></details> |

However, achieving efficient real-time performance remains challenging due to the high computational demands of existing models. To overcome this, we propose Dual Process VLA (DP-VLA), a hierarchical framework inspired by dual-process theory. DP-VLA utilizes a Large System 2 Model (L-Sys2) for complex reasoning and decision-making, while a Small System 1 Model (S-Sys1) handles real-time motor control and sensory processing. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs), the L-Sys2 operates at low frequencies, reducing computational overhead, while the S-Sys1 ensures fast and accurate task execution. Experimental results on the RoboCasa dataset demonstrate that DP-VLA achieves faster inference and higher task success rates, providing a scalable solution for advanced robotic applications.</p></details> | 10 page |

GRS enables the creation of digital twin simulations from single real-world RGB-D observations, complete with diverse, solvable tasks for virtual agent training. We use state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to achieve a comprehensive real-to-sim pipeline. GRS operates in three stages: 1) scene comprehension using SAM2 for object segmentation and VLMs for object description, 2) matching identified objects with simulation-ready assets, and 3) generating contextually appropriate robotic tasks. Our approach ensures simulations align with task specifications by generating test suites designed to verify adherence to the task specification. We introduce a router that iteratively refines the simulation and test code to ensure the simulation is solvable by a robot policy while remaining aligned to the task specification. Our experiments demonstrate the system's efficacy in accurately identifying object correspondence, which allows us to generate task environments that closely match input environments, and enhance automated simulation task generation through our novel router mechanism.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we argue that the text classifiers adopted by existing OVSGG methods, i.e., category-/part-level prompts, are scene-agnostic as they remain unchanged across contexts. Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term "specific" means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter. It refines CLIP's ability to recognize relations by learning an interaction-aware semantic space. Extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks show that SDSGG outperforms top-leading methods by a clear margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024.

A Five-in-One Video Annotations Benchmark for Better Human-Machine Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15270v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in addressing complex video tasks, sparking researchers' interest in their human-like multimodal understanding capabilities. Video description serves as a fundamental task for evaluating video comprehension, necessitating a deep understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics, which presents challenges for both humans and machines. Thus, investigating whether LVLMs can describe videos as comprehensively as humans (through reasonable human-machine comparisons using video captioning as a proxy task) will enhance our understanding and application of these models. However, current benchmarks for video comprehension have notable limitations, including short video durations, brief annotations, and reliance on a single annotator's perspective. These factors hinder a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' ability to understand complex, lengthy videos and prevent the establishment of a robust human baseline that accurately reflects human video comprehension capabilities. To address these issues, we propose a novel benchmark, FIOVA (Five In One Video Annotations), designed to evaluate the differences between LVLMs and human understanding more comprehensively. FIOVA includes 3,002 long video sequences (averaging 33.6 seconds) that cover diverse scenarios with complex spatiotemporal relationships. Each video is annotated by five distinct annotators, capturing a wide range of perspectives and resulting in captions that are 4-15 times longer than existing benchmarks, thereby establishing a robust baseline that represents human understanding comprehensively for the first time in video description tasks. Using the FIOVA benchmark, we conducted an in-depth evaluation of six state-of-the-art LVLMs, comparing their performance with humans.

To do this, our system optimizes the parameters of a deformation model to maximize an objective function based on the widely used pre-trained vision language model CLIP. We find that CLIP-based objective functions exhibit many spurious local optima; to circumvent them, we parameterize deformations using a novel deformation model called BoxDefGraph which our system automatically computes from an input mesh, the BoxDefGraph is designed to capture the object aligned rectangular/circular geometry features of most manufactured objects. We then use the CMA-ES global optimization algorithm to maximize our objective, which we find to work better than popular gradient-based optimizers. We demonstrate that our approach produces appealing results and outperforms several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Based on our observations, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed \emph{Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide)}, aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have the potential to assist in understanding anatomical information, diagnosing eye diseases, and drafting interpretations and follow-up plans, thereby reducing the burden on clinicians and improving access to eye care. However, limited benchmarks are available to assess LVLMs' performance in ophthalmology-specific applications. In this study, we introduce LMOD, a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark consisting of 21,993 instances across (1) five ophthalmic imaging modalities: optical coherence tomography, color fundus photographs, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, lens photographs, and surgical scenes; (2) free-text, demographic, and disease biomarker information; and (3) primary ophthalmology-specific applications such as anatomical information understanding, disease diagnosis, and subgroup analysis. In addition, we benchmarked 13 state-of-the-art LVLM representatives from closed-source, open-source, and medical domains. The results demonstrate a significant performance drop for LVLMs in ophthalmology compared to other domains. Systematic error analysis further identified six major failure modes: misclassification, failure to abstain, inconsistent reasoning, hallucination, assertions without justification, and lack of domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, supervised neural networks specifically trained on these tasks as baselines demonstrated high accuracy. These findings underscore the pressing need for benchmarks in the development and validation of ophthalmology-specific LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kfzyqin.github.io/lmod/</p></details> |

However, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can severely compromise their performance and reliability in real-world scenarios. Previous methods have primarily focused on improving robustness through adversarial training and generating adversarial examples using models like FGSM, AutoAttack, and DeepFool. However, these approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as fixed perturbation norms or predefined attack patterns, and involve high computational complexity, making them challenging to implement in practical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework that integrates multiple attack strategies and advanced machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the robustness of VLMs against a broad range of adversarial attacks. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances model robustness. The fine-tuned CLIP model achieved an accuracy of 43.5% on adversarially perturbed images, compared to only 4% for the baseline model. The neural network model achieved a high accuracy of 98% in these challenging classification tasks, while the XGBoost model reached a success rate of 85.26% in prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

A Mechanistic Interpretability Pipeline for Gaussian-Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16320v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained community-spanning prominence due to their ability to integrate visual and textual inputs to perform complex tasks. Despite their success, the internal decision-making processes of these models remain opaque, posing challenges in high-stakes applications. To address this, we introduce NOTICE, the first Noise-free Text-Image Corruption and Evaluation pipeline for mechanistic interpretability in VLMs. NOTICE incorporates a Semantic Minimal Pairs (SMP) framework for image corruption and Symmetric Token Replacement (STR) for text. This approach enables semantically meaningful causal mediation analysis for both modalities, providing a robust method for analyzing multimodal integration within models like BLIP. Our experiments on the SVO-Probes, MIT-States, and Facial Expression Recognition datasets reveal crucial insights into VLM decision-making, identifying the significant role of middle-layer cross-attention heads. Further, we uncover a set of ``universal cross-attention heads'' that consistently contribute across tasks and modalities, each performing distinct functions such as implicit image segmentation, object inhibition, and outlier inhibition. This work paves the way for more transparent and interpretable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike standard video captioning, it involves not only describing key visual details but also inferring plots that unfold across multiple movie shots, presenting distinct and complex challenges. To advance this field, we introduce Movie101v2, a large-scale, bilingual dataset with enhanced data quality specifically designed for movie narration. Revisiting the task, we propose breaking down the ultimate goal of automatic movie narration into three progressive stages, offering a clear roadmap with corresponding evaluation metrics. Based on our new benchmark, we baseline a range of large vision-language models, including GPT-4V, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in narration generation. Our findings highlight that achieving applicable movie narration generation is a fascinating goal that requires significant research.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, ACM format</p></details> |

However, an understudied question is to what extent models that only have access to vision and text modalities are able to implicitly understand sound-based phenomena via abstract reasoning from orthography and imagery alone. To investigate this, we analyse the ability of VLMs and LLMs to demonstrate sound symbolism (i.e., to recognise a non-arbitrary link between sounds and concepts) as well as their ability to "hear" via the interplay of the language and vision modules of open and closed-source multimodal models. We perform multiple experiments, including replicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolism tasks, and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that of LLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement with human labels, and more task information may be required for VLMs versus their human counterparts for in silico experimentation. We additionally see through higher maximum agreement levels that Magnitude Symbolism is an easier pattern for VLMs to identify than Shape Symbolism, and that an understanding of linguistic iconicity is highly dependent on model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Camera Ready)</p></details> |

Typically, MLLMs struggle with handling thousands of visual tokens that exceed the maximum context length, and they suffer from the information decay due to token aggregation. Another challenge is the high computational cost stemming from the large number of video tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose Video-XL, an extra-long vision language model designed for efficient hour-scale video understanding. Specifically, we argue that LLMs can be adapted as effective visual condensers and propose Visual Context Latent Summarization which condenses visual contexts into highly compact forms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves promising results on popular long video understanding benchmarks. For example, Video-XL outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on VNBench by nearly 10\% in accuracy. Moreover, Video-XL presents an impressive balance between efficiency and effectiveness, processing 2048 frames on a single 80GB GPU while achieving nearly 95% accuracy in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, this task has been tackled by processing either audio signals or visual data, or by combining both modalities through fusion or joint learning. In our study, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in visual-language models, we introduce a novel approach leveraging Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models. The CLIP visual encoder analyzes video segments composed of the upper body of an individual, while the text encoder handles textual descriptions automatically generated through prompt engineering. Subsequently, embeddings from these encoders are fused through a deep neural network to perform VAD. Our experimental analysis across three VAD benchmarks showcases the superior performance of our method compared to existing visual VAD approaches. Notably, our approach outperforms several audio-visual methods despite its simplicity, and without requiring pre-training on extensive audio-visual datasets.</p></details> |  |

But in many cases, large scale datasets with video-label pairs for localization are unavailable, limiting the opportunity to fine-tune video-understanding models. Recent developments in large vision-language models (LVLM) address this need with impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of video understanding tasks. However, the adaptation of image-based LVLMs, with their powerful visual question answering capabilities, to action localization in long-form video is still relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a true ZEro-shot Action Localization method (ZEAL). Specifically, we leverage the built-in action knowledge of a large language model (LLM) to inflate actions into highly-detailed descriptions of the archetypal start and end of the action. These descriptions serve as queries to LVLM for generating frame-level confidence scores which can be aggregated to produce localization outputs. The simplicity and flexibility of our method lends it amenable to more capable LVLMs as they are developed, and we demonstrate remarkable results in zero-shot action localization on a challenging benchmark, without any training.</p></details> |  |

However, memory lapses can occur. One promising avenue for achieving memory augmentation is through the use of augmented reality head-mounted displays to capture and preserve egocentric videos, a practice commonly referred to as lifelogging. However, a significant challenge arises from the sheer volume of video data generated through lifelogging, as the current technology lacks the capability to encode and store such large amounts of data efficiently. Further, retrieving specific information from extensive video archives requires substantial computational power, further complicating the task of quickly accessing desired content. To address these challenges, we propose a memory augmentation agent that involves leveraging natural language encoding for video data and storing them in a vector database. This approach harnesses the power of large vision language models to perform the language encoding process. Additionally, we propose using large language models to facilitate natural language querying. Our agent underwent extensive evaluation using the QA-Ego4D dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results with a BLEU score of 8.3, outperforming conventional machine learning models that scored between 3.4 and 5.8. Additionally, we conducted a user study in which participants interacted with the human memory augmentation agent through episodic memory and open-ended questions. The results of this study show that the agent results in significantly better recall performance on episodic memory tasks compared to human participants. The results also highlight the agent's practical applicability and user acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\% and 9.5\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements.

However, compared to 2D medical images, 3D medical images, such as CT scans, face challenges related to limited training data and high dimension, which severely restrict the progress of 3D medical vision-language models. To address these issues, we collect a large amount of unlabeled 3D CT data and utilize self-supervised learning to construct a 3D visual foundation model for extracting 3D visual features. Then, we apply 3D spatial convolutions to aggregate and project high-level image features, reducing computational complexity while preserving spatial information. We also construct two instruction-tuning datasets based on BIMCV-R and CT-RATE to fine-tune the 3D vision-language model. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in report generation, visual question answering, and disease diagnosis. Code and data will be made publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in safety training, laboratory personnel may still unknowingly engage in unsafe practices. With the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for guidance in various fields, including laboratory settings, there is a growing concern about their reliability in critical safety-related decision-making. Unlike trained human researchers, LLMs lack formal lab safety education, raising questions about their ability to provide safe and accurate guidance. Existing research on LLM trustworthiness primarily focuses on issues such as ethical compliance, truthfulness, and fairness but fails to fully cover safety-critical real-world applications, like lab safety. To address this gap, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework based on a new taxonomy aligned with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols. This benchmark includes 765 multiple-choice questions verified by human experts, assessing LLMs and vision language models (VLMs) performance in lab safety contexts. Our evaluations demonstrate that while GPT-4o outperforms human participants, it is still prone to critical errors, highlighting the risks of relying on LLMs in safety-critical environments. Our findings emphasize the need for specialized benchmarks to accurately assess the trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world safety applications.</p></details> | 50 pages, 19 figures |

Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-chart tasks, neglecting the multi-hop reasoning required to extract and integrate information from multiple charts, which is essential in practical applications. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiChartQA, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in four key areas: direct question answering, parallel question answering, comparative reasoning, and sequential reasoning. Our evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals significant performance gaps compared to humans. These results highlight the challenges in multi-chart comprehension and the potential of MultiChartQA to drive advancements in this field.

However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p></details> |  |

However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions, and limited multi-modal capacities). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features multi-run proactive perception and decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms both existing multi-step reasoning frameworks and passive peer methods on a wide range of benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models. In addition, with the assistance of LLMs, ProReason achieves a performance improvement of up to 15% on MMMU benchmark. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Vision-Language Models by Summarizing Visual Tokens into Compact Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14072v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their potential for real-world applications, enabling these models to perform complex reasoning on images. In the widely used fully autoregressive transformer-based models like LLaVA, projected visual tokens are prepended to textual tokens. Oftentimes, visual tokens are significantly more than prompt tokens, resulting in increased computational overhead during both training and inference. In this paper, we propose Visual Compact Token Registers (Victor), a method that reduces the number of visual tokens by summarizing them into a smaller set of register tokens. Victor adds a few learnable register tokens after the visual tokens and summarizes the visual information into these registers using the first few layers in the language tower of VLMs. After these few layers, all visual tokens are discarded, significantly improving computational efficiency for both training and inference. Notably, our method is easy to implement and requires a small number of new trainable parameters with minimal impact on model performance. In our experiment, with merely 8 visual registers--about 1% of the original tokens--Victor shows less than a 4% accuracy drop while reducing the total training time by 43% and boosting the inference throughput by 3.3X.</p></details> |  |

Thus, it is essential for LVLMs to proactively engage with humans to ask for clarifications or additional information for better responses. In this study, we aim to shift LVLMs from passive answer providers to proactive engaged partners. We begin by establishing a three-tiered hierarchy for questions of invalid, ambiguous, and personalizable nature to measure the proactive engagement capabilities of LVLMs. Utilizing this hierarchy, we create PIE, (ProactIve Engagement Evaluation) through GPT-4o and human annotators, consisting of 853 questions across six distinct, fine-grained question types that are verified by human annotators and accompanied with well-defined metrics. Our evaluations on \benchmark indicate poor performance of existing LVLMs, with the best-performing open-weights model only achieving an Aggregate Align Rate (AAR) of 0.28. In response, we introduce MACAROON, self-iMaginAtion for ContrAstive pReference OptimizatiON, which instructs LVLMs to autonomously generate contrastive response pairs for unlabeled questions given the task description and human-crafted criteria. Then, the self-imagined data is formatted for conditional reinforcement learning. Experimental results show MACAROON effectively improves LVLMs' capabilities to be proactively engaged (0.84 AAR) while maintaining comparable performance on general tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be made public at https://github.com/ShujinWu-0814/MACAROON</p></details> |

However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a novel debiasing framework for LVLMs by directly ablating biased attributes during text generation to avoid generating text related to protected attributes, or even representing them internally. Our method requires no training and a relatively small amount of representative biased outputs (~1000 samples). Our experiments show that not only can we can minimize the propensity of LVLMs to generate text related to protected attributes, but we can even use synthetic data to inform the ablation while retaining captioning performance on real data such as COCO. Furthermore, we find the resulting generations from a debiased LVLM exhibit similar accuracy as a baseline biased model, showing that debiasing effects can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS workshop on SafeGenAI, 10 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Traditional methods depending on supervised learning with 3D point clouds are limited by scarce datasets. Recently zero-shot methods leveraging LLMs have been proposed to address the data issue.

Beyond mere data augmentation, our research in this paper highlights an additional, significant capacity of deep generative models: their ability to reveal and demonstrate patterns in medical images. We employ a generative structure with hybrid conditions, combining clinical data and segmentation masks to guide the image synthesis process. Furthermore, we innovatively transformed the tabular clinical data into textual descriptions. This approach simplifies the handling of missing values and also enables us to leverage large pre-trained vision-language models that investigate the relations between independent clinical entries and comprehend general terms, such as gender and smoking status. Our approach differs from and presents a more challenging task than traditional medical report-guided synthesis due to the less visual correlation of our clinical information with the images. To overcome this, we introduce a text-visual embedding mechanism that strengthens the conditions, ensuring the network effectively utilizes the provided information. Our pipeline is generalizable to both GAN-based and diffusion models. Experiments on chest CT, particularly focusing on the smoking status, demonstrated a consistent intensity shift in the lungs which is in agreement with clinical observations, indicating the effectiveness of our method in capturing and visualizing the impact of specific attributes on medical image patterns.

However, there has been no investigation into whether contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating radicals into the prompts for Chinese language processing (CLP) tasks. We observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP by integrating sub-character information.</p></details> |  |

We propose \textbf{Arcana}, a multiModal language model, which introduces two crucial techniques. First, we present Multimodal LoRA (MM-LoRA), a module designed to enhance the decoder. Unlike traditional language-driven decoders, MM-LoRA consists of two parallel LoRAs -- one for vision and one for language -- each with its own parameters. This disentangled parameters design allows for more specialized learning in each modality and better integration of multimodal information. Second, we introduce the Query Ladder adapter (QLadder) to improve the visual encoder. QLadder employs a learnable ``\textit{ladder}'' structure to deeply aggregates the intermediate representations from the frozen pretrained visual encoder (e.g., CLIP image encoder). This enables the model to learn new and informative visual features, as well as remaining the powerful capabilities of the pretrained visual encoder. These techniques collectively enhance Arcana's visual perception power, enabling it to leverage improved visual information for more accurate and contextually relevant outputs across various multimodal scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our Arcana.

A similar ability is desirable for the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. While state-of-the-art models are rapidly closing the gap with human-level performance on diverse computer vision and NLP tasks separately, they struggle to solve tasks that require joint reasoning over visual and textual modalities. Inspired by GLUE (Wang et. al., 2018)- a multitask benchmark for natural language understanding, we propose VL-GLUE in this paper. VL-GLUE consists of over 100k samples spanned across seven different tasks, which at their core require visuo-linguistic reasoning. Moreover, our benchmark comprises of diverse image types (from synthetically rendered figures, and day-to-day scenes to charts and complex diagrams) and includes a broad variety of domain-specific text (from cooking, politics, and sports to high-school curricula), demonstrating the need for multi-modal understanding in the real-world. We show that this benchmark is quite challenging for existing large-scale vision-language models and encourage development of systems that possess robust visuo-linguistic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[H2OVL-Mississippi Vision Language Models Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13611v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smaller vision-language models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly important for privacy-focused, on-device applications due to their ability to run efficiently on consumer hardware for processing enterprise commercial documents and images. These models require strong language understanding and visual capabilities to enhance human-machine interaction. To address this need, we present H2OVL-Mississippi, a pair of small VLMs trained on 37 million image-text pairs using 240 hours of compute on 8 x H100 GPUs. H2OVL-Mississippi-0.8B is a tiny model with 0.8 billion parameters that specializes in text recognition, achieving state of the art performance on the Text Recognition portion of OCRBench and surpassing much larger models in this area. Additionally, we are releasing H2OVL-Mississippi-2B, a 2 billion parameter model for general use cases, exhibiting highly competitive metrics across various academic benchmarks. Both models build upon our prior work with H2O-Danube language models, extending their capabilities into the visual domain. We release them under the Apache 2.0 license, making VLMs accessible to everyone, democratizing document AI and visual LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in various multimodal tasks. Yet, they still struggle with geometry problems and are significantly limited by their inability to perform mathematical operations not seen during pre-training, such as calculating the cosine of an arbitrary angle, and by difficulties in correctly applying relevant geometry formulas. To overcome these challenges, we present GeoCoder, which leverages modular code-finetuning to generate and execute code using a predefined geometry function library. By executing the code, we achieve accurate and deterministic calculations, contrasting the stochastic nature of autoregressive token prediction, while the function library minimizes errors in formula usage. We also propose a multimodal retrieval-augmented variant of GeoCoder, named RAG-GeoCoder, which incorporates a non-parametric memory module for retrieving functions from the geometry library, thereby reducing reliance on parametric memory. Our modular code-finetuning approach enhances the geometric reasoning capabilities of VLMs, yielding an average improvement of over 16% across various question complexities on the GeomVerse dataset compared to other finetuning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MirrorCheck: Efficient Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09250v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks as various novel attack strategies are being proposed against these models. While existing defenses excel in unimodal contexts, they currently fall short in safeguarding VLMs against adversarial threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel, yet elegantly simple approach for detecting adversarial samples in VLMs. Our method leverages Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate images based on captions produced by target VLMs. Subsequently, we calculate the similarities of the embeddings of both input and generated images in the feature space to identify adversarial samples. Empirical evaluations conducted on different datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming baseline methods adapted from image classification domains. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to classification tasks, showcasing its adaptability and model-agnostic nature. Theoretical analyses and empirical findings also show the resilience of our approach against adaptive attacks, positioning it as an excellent defense mechanism for real-world deployment against adversarial threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Summary-Guided Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13321v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</p></details> |  |

The agent's primary task is identifying the screen coordinates of the UI element corresponding to the user's command. It demonstrates strong performance on Screenspot and OmniAct, while maintaining a compact size of 0.27B parameters and minimal latency. Relevant improvement comes from multi-task training and MLLM-based data augmentation. Manually annotated corpora are scarce, but we show that MLLM augmentation might produce better results. On Screenspot and OmniAct, our model outperforms both GUI-specific models (e.g., SeeClick) and MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V).</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The model is available at huggingface.co/Samsung/TinyClick</p></details> |
| **[OpenDAS: Open-Vocabulary Domain Adaptation for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20141v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced segmentation techniques by shifting from the traditional segmentation of a closed-set of predefined object classes to open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS), allowing users to segment novel classes and concepts unseen during training of the segmentation model. However, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: fully-supervised closed-set methods still outperform OVS methods on base classes, that is on classes on which they have been explicitly trained. This is due to the lack of pixel-aligned training masks for VLMs (which are trained on image-caption pairs), and the absence of domain-specific knowledge, such as autonomous driving. Therefore, we propose the task of open-vocabulary domain adaptation to infuse domain-specific knowledge into VLMs while preserving their open-vocabulary nature. By doing so, we achieve improved performance in base and novel classes. Existing VLM adaptation methods improve performance on base (training) queries, but fail to fully preserve the open-set capabilities of VLMs on novel queries. To address this shortcoming, we combine parameter-efficient prompt tuning with a triplet-loss-based training strategy that uses auxiliary negative queries. Notably, our approach is the only parameter-efficient method that consistently surpasses the original VLM on novel classes. Our adapted VLMs can seamlessly be integrated into existing OVS pipelines, e.g., improving OVSeg by +6.0% mIoU on ADE20K for open-vocabulary 2D segmentation, and OpenMask3D by +4.1% AP on ScanNet++ Offices for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation without other changes.</p></details> |  |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies. https://sites.google.com/corp/view/safe-robots</p></details> |  |

A primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues, and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable, leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views. To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

In this paper, we analyze demographic biases across five models and six datasets. We find that portrait datasets like UTKFace and CelebA are the best tools for bias detection, finding gaps in performance and fairness between LLaVa and CLIP models. However, scene based datasets like PATA, VLStereoSet fail to be useful benchmarks for bias due to their construction. As for pronoun based datasets like VisoGender, we receive mixed signals as only some subsets of the data are useful in providing insights. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a more difficult version of VisoGender to serve as a more rigorous evaluation. Based on these results, we call for more effective and carefully designed datasets to ensure VLMs are both fair and reliable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[RULE: Reliable Multimodal RAG for Factuality in Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05131v2)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has enhanced medical diagnosis. However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on medical VQA and report generation tasks across three datasets, achieving an average improvement of 47.4% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |
| **[Trust but Verify: Programmatic VLM Evaluation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13121v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect responses to visual queries. However, reliably quantifying the effect of such hallucinations in free-form responses to open-ended queries is challenging as it requires visually verifying each claim within the response. We propose Programmatic VLM Evaluation (PROVE), a new benchmarking paradigm for evaluating VLM responses to open-ended queries. To construct PROVE, we provide a large language model (LLM) with a high-fidelity scene-graph representation constructed from a hyper-detailed image caption, and prompt it to generate diverse question-answer (QA) pairs, as well as programs that can be executed over the scene graph object to verify each QA pair. We thus construct a benchmark of 10.5k challenging but visually grounded QA pairs. Next, to evaluate free-form model responses to queries in PROVE, we propose a programmatic evaluation strategy that measures both the helpfulness and truthfulness of a response within a unified scene graph-based framework. We benchmark the helpfulness-truthfulness trade-offs of a range of VLMs on PROVE, finding that very few are in-fact able to achieve a good balance between the two.

As all images need to be converted into image tokens to fit the input format of large language models (LLMs) along with natural language prompts, sequential visual representation is essential to the performance of LVLMs, and the information flow analysis approach can be an effective tool for determining interactions between these representations. In this paper, we propose integrating attention analysis with LLaVA-CAM, concretely, attention scores highlight relevant regions during forward propagation, while LLaVA-CAM captures gradient changes through backward propagation, revealing key image features. By exploring the information flow from the perspective of visual representation contribution, we observe that it tends to converge in shallow layers but diversify in deeper layers. To validate our analysis, we conduct comprehensive experiments with truncation strategies across various LVLMs for visual question answering and image captioning tasks, and experimental results not only verify our hypothesis but also reveal a consistent pattern of information flow convergence in the corresponding layers, and the information flow cliff layer will be different due to different contexts.

| **[Self-Comparison for Dataset-Level Membership Inference in Large (Vision-)Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13088v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in a wide range of natural language processing and vision-language tasks. Access to large web-scale datasets has been a key factor in their success. However, concerns have been raised about the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials and potential copyright infringement. Existing methods, such as sample-level Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and distribution-based dataset inference, distinguish member data (data used for training) and non-member data by leveraging the common observation that models tend to memorize and show greater confidence in member data. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges when applied to LLMs and VLMs, such as the requirement for ground-truth member data or non-member data that shares the same distribution as the test data. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset-level membership inference method based on Self-Comparison. We find that a member prefix followed by a non-member suffix (paraphrased from a member suffix) can further trigger the model's memorization on training data. Instead of directly comparing member and non-member data, we introduce paraphrasing to the second half of the sequence and evaluate how the likelihood changes before and after paraphrasing. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require access to ground-truth member data or non-member data in identical distribution, making it more practical. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms traditional MIA and dataset inference techniques across various datasets and models, including including public models, fine-tuned models, and API-based commercial models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13085v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Fairness in Large Vision-Language Models Across Diverse Demographic Attributes and Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17974v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate visual fairness in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for bias mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future bias reduction efforts.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we evaluate the ability of generative VLMs to understand lexical and semantic changes in text using the SugarCrepe++ dataset. We analyze the sensitivity of VLMs to lexical alterations in prompts without corresponding semantic changes. Our findings demonstrate that generative VLMs are highly sensitive to such alterations. Additionally, we show that this vulnerability affects the performance of techniques aimed at achieving consistency in their outputs.</p></details> |  |

However, such models are tricky to efficiently train and often struggle to generalize beyond their training scenarios, limiting adaptability to new environments, tasks, and concepts. In this work, we investigate the minimal data requirements and architectural adaptations necessary to achieve robust closed-loop performance with vision-based control policies under unseen text instructions and visual distribution shifts. To this end, we design datasets with various levels of data representation richness, refine feature extraction protocols by leveraging multi-modal foundation model encoders, and assess the suitability of different policy network heads. Our findings are synthesized in Flex (Fly-lexically), a framework that uses pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) as frozen patch-wise feature extractors, generating spatially aware embeddings that integrate semantic and visual information. These rich features form the basis for training highly robust downstream policies capable of generalizing across platforms, environments, and text-specified tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on quadrotor fly-to-target tasks, where agents trained via behavior cloning on a small simulated dataset successfully generalize to real-world scenes, handling diverse novel goals and command formulations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce BlabberSeg, an optimized Vision-Language Model built on CLIPSeg for on-board, real-time processing of aerial images by UAVs. BlabberSeg improves the efficiency of CLIPSeg by reusing prompt and model features, reducing computational overhead while achieving real-time open-vocabulary aerial segmentation. We validated BlabberSeg in a safe landing scenario using the Dynamic Open-Vocabulary Enhanced SafE-Landing with Intelligence (DOVESEI) framework, which uses visual servoing and open-vocabulary segmentation. BlabberSeg reduces computational costs significantly, with a speed increase of 927.41% (16.78 Hz) on a NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX (64GB) compared with the original CLIPSeg (1.81Hz), achieving real-time aerial segmentation with negligible loss in accuracy (2.1% as the ratio of the correctly segmented area with respect to CLIPSeg). BlabberSeg's source code is open and available online.</p></details> |  |

Limited by resource and application constrains, only sparsely-distributed transducer arrays can be applied, which necessitates advanced image reconstruction algorithms to overcome artifacts caused by using back-projection algorithm. However, high computing memory consumption of traditional iterative algorithms for large-scale 3D cases is practically unacceptable. Here, we propose a point cloud-based iterative algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein a 3D photoacoustic scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources. During the iterative reconstruction process, the properties of each Gaussian source, including peak intensities, standard deviations and means are stored in form of point cloud, then continuously optimized and adaptively undergoing destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction, thus manifesting the sliding ball adaptive growth effect. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality 3D large-scale PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely less memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Building on ProTeGi, MAPO uses positive natural language "gradients" and a momentum-based extension to refine prompts effectively. By tracking gradient history, MAPO avoids local minima and oscillations. It also utilizes beam search and an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for balanced candidate expansion and selection. Benchmark testing shows that MAPO achieves faster convergence time with fewer API calls and higher F1 scores than ProTeGi, proving it as a robust and scalable solution for automated prompt engineering in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Past research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However, much less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions included in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose SPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from prespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general scenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47 different types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a single optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for each individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations leads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature. Experiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize effectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study provides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM potential.</p></details> |  |

However, the recent advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) with tens to hundreds of billions of parameters makes the naive application of traditional FL methods to LLMs impractical due to high computational and communication costs. Furthermore, end users of LLMs often lack access to full architectures and weights of the models, making it impossible for participants to fine-tune these models directly. This paper introduces a novel FL scheme for LLMs, named LanFL, which is purely prompt-based and treats the underlying LLMs as black boxes. We have developed a differentially private synthetic sample generation mechanism to facilitate knowledge sharing among participants, along with a prompt optimization scheme that enables learning from synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LanFL successfully facilitates learning among participants while preserving the privacy of local datasets across various tasks.</p></details> |  |

While open-source models, hosted locally on the user's machine, alleviate some concerns, models that users can host locally are often less capable than proprietary frontier models. Toward preserving user privacy while retaining the best quality, we propose Privacy-Conscious Delegation, a novel task for chaining API-based and local models. We utilize recent public collections of user-LLM interactions to construct a natural benchmark called PUPA, which contains personally identifiable information (PII). To study potential approaches, we devise PAPILLON, a multi-stage LLM pipeline that uses prompt optimization to address a simpler version of our task. Our best pipeline maintains high response quality for 85.5% of user queries while restricting privacy leakage to only 7.5%. We still leave a large margin to the generation quality of proprietary LLMs for future work. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/siyan-sylvia-li/PAPILLON.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability to news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first self-tuning prompting framework for news recommendation, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex news recommendation tasks. This framework incorporates a news recommender and a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process to enhance recommendations through automatic prompt engineering. Extensive experimental results with 400 users show that RecPrompt can achieve an improvement of 3.36% in AUC, 10.49% in MRR, 9.64% in nDCG@5, and 6.20% in nDCG@10 compared to deep neural models. Additionally, we introduce TopicScore, a novel metric to assess explainability by evaluating LLM's ability to summarize topics of interest for users. The results show LLM's effectiveness in accurately identifying topics of interest and delivering comprehensive topic-based explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama. These attacks are multimodal, and we show variants in the text-only and image domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://imprompter.ai code: https://github.com/Reapor-Yurnero/imprompter v2 changelog: add new results to Table 3, correct several typos</p></details> |
| **[IPO: Interpretable Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15397v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for thae creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v4)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fairer Preferences Elicit Improved Human-Aligned Large Language Model Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11370v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities as cost-effective and reference-free evaluators for assessing language generation quality. In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce "Survival of the Safest" (SoS), an innovative multi-objective prompt optimization framework that enhances both performance and security in LLMs simultaneously. SoS utilizes an interleaved multi-objective evolution strategy, integrating semantic, feedback, and crossover mutations to effectively traverse the prompt landscape. Differing from the computationally demanding Pareto front methods, SoS provides a scalable solution that expedites optimization in complex, high-dimensional discrete search spaces while keeping computational demands low. Our approach accommodates flexible weighting of objectives and generates a pool of optimized candidates, empowering users to select prompts that optimally meet their specific performance and security needs. Experimental evaluations across diverse benchmark datasets affirm SoS's efficacy in delivering high performance and notably enhancing safety and security compared to single-objective methods. This advancement marks a significant stride towards the deployment of LLM systems that are both high-performing and secure across varied industrial applications</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

When dealing with complex issues, prompt engineers tend to distill multiple patterns from examples and inject relevant solutions to optimize the prompts, achieving satisfying results. However, existing automatic prompt optimization techniques are only limited to producing single flow instructions, struggling with handling diverse patterns. In this paper, we present AMPO, an automatic prompt optimization method that can iteratively develop a multi-branched prompt using failure cases as feedback. Our goal is to explore a novel way of structuring prompts with multi-branches to better handle multiple patterns in complex tasks, for which we introduce three modules: Pattern Recognition, Branch Adjustment, and Branch Pruning. In experiments across five tasks, AMPO consistently achieves the best results. Additionally, our approach demonstrates significant optimization efficiency due to our adoption of a minimal search strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

While existing prompt optimization methods improve prompt effectiveness, they often lead to prompt drifting, where newly generated prompts can adversely impact previously successful cases while addressing failures. Furthermore, these methods tend to rely heavily on LLMs' intrinsic capabilities for prompt optimization tasks. In this paper, we introduce StraGo (Strategic-Guided Optimization), a novel approach designed to mitigate prompt drifting by leveraging insights from both successful and failed cases to identify critical factors for achieving optimization objectives. StraGo employs a how-to-do methodology, integrating in-context learning to formulate specific, actionable strategies that provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for prompt optimization. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of tasks, including reasoning, natural language understanding, domain-specific knowledge, and industrial applications, demonstrate StraGo's superior performance. It establishes a new state-of-the-art in prompt optimization, showcasing its ability to deliver stable and effective prompt improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for producing high-quality generations. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that can encourage the emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes the generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across various types of T2I models, demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

While contemporary frontier LLMs are capable enough to power reasonably good Language agents, the closed-API model makes it hard to improve in cases they perform sub-optimally. To address this, recent works have explored ways to improve their performance using techniques like self-reflection and prompt optimization. Unfortunately, techniques like self-reflection can be used only in an online setup, while contemporary prompt optimization techniques are designed and tested to work on simple tasks. To this end, we introduce MetaReflection, a novel offline reinforcement learning technique that enhances the performance of Language Agents by augmenting a semantic memory based on experiential learnings from past trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaReflection by evaluating across multiple domains, including complex logical reasoning, biomedical semantic similarity, open world question answering, and vulnerability threat detection, in Infrastructure-as-Code, spanning different agent designs. MetaReflection boosts Language agents' performance by 4% to 16.82% over the raw GPT-4 baseline and performs on par with existing state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques while requiring fewer LLM calls.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our experimental code at: https://aka.ms/metareflection-code</p></details> |

However, these approaches are suboptimal for generative tasks, which require more nuanced guidance beyond a single numeric metric to improve the prompt and optimize multiple aspects of the generated text. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-aspect Critique-Suggestion-guided automatic Prompt Optimization (CriSPO) approach. CriSPO introduces a critique-suggestion module as its core component. This module spontaneously discovers aspects, and compares generated and reference texts across these aspects, providing specific suggestions for prompt modification. These clear critiques and actionable suggestions guide a receptive optimizer module to make more substantial changes, exploring a broader and more effective search space. To further improve CriSPO with multi-metric optimization, we introduce an Automatic Suffix Tuning (AST) extension to enhance the performance of task prompts across multiple metrics. We evaluate CriSPO on 4 state-of-the-art LLMs across 4 summarization and 5 QA datasets. Extensive experiments show 3-4\% ROUGE score improvement on summarization and substantial improvement of various metrics on QA.</p></details> |  |

Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel algorithm for optimizing LM programs. MIPRO outperforms baseline optimizers on five of seven diverse multi-stage LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 13% accuracy.

LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

Through a feedback-driven critique and synthesis process, PromptWizard achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation, iteratively refining both prompt instructions and in-context examples to generate human-readable, task-specific prompts. This guided approach systematically improves prompt quality, resulting in superior performance across 45 tasks. PromptWizard excels even with limited training data, smaller LLMs, and various LLM architectures. Additionally, our cost analysis reveals a substantial reduction in API calls, token usage, and overall cost, demonstrating PromptWizard's efficiency, scalability, and advantages over existing prompt optimization strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

SGCode integrates recent prompt-optimization approaches with LLMs in a unified system accessible through front-end and back-end APIs, enabling users to 1) generate secure code, which is free of vulnerabilities, 2) review and share security analysis, and 3) easily switch from one prompt optimization approach to another, while providing insights on model and system performance. We populated SGCode on an AWS server with PromSec, an approach that optimizes prompts by combining an LLM and security tools with a lightweight generative adversarial graph neural network to detect and fix security vulnerabilities in the generated code. Extensive experiments show that SGCode is practical as a public tool to gain insights into the trade-offs between model utility, secure code generation, and system cost. SGCode has only a marginal cost compared with prompting LLMs. SGCode is available at: https://sgcode.codes/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Contrastive Prompts: Automated Optimization and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15199v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs evolve, significant effort is spent on manually crafting prompts. While existing prompt optimization methods automate this process, they rely solely on learning from incorrect samples, leading to a sub-optimal performance. Additionally, an unexplored challenge in the literature is prompts effective for prior models may not perform well on newer versions or different languages. We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages. LCP offers a systematic approach to prompt engineering, reducing manual effort in deploying LLMs across varied contexts.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to assist them in their work poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structural design, incurring high learning costs and it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts, especially for non-AI experts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a structural prompt design framework. Furthermore, we introduce Minstrel, a multi-generative agent system with reflection to automate the generation of structural prompts. Experiments and the case study illustrate that structural prompts generated by Minstrel or written manually significantly enhance the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the ease of use of structural prompts through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.16929</p></details> |

However, they often introduce security vulnerabilities due to training on insecure open-source data. This highlights the need for ensuring secure and functional code generation. This paper introduces PromSec, an algorithm for prom optimization for secure and functioning code generation using LLMs. In PromSec, we combine 1) code vulnerability clearing using a generative adversarial graph neural network, dubbed as gGAN, to fix and reduce security vulnerabilities in generated codes and 2) code generation using an LLM into an interactive loop, such that the outcome of the gGAN drives the LLM with enhanced prompts to generate secure codes while preserving their functionality. Introducing a new contrastive learning approach in gGAN, we formulate code-clearing and generation as a dual-objective optimization problem, enabling PromSec to notably reduce the number of LLM inferences. PromSec offers a cost-effective and practical solution for generating secure, functional code. Extensive experiments conducted on Python and Java code datasets confirm that PromSec effectively enhances code security while upholding its intended functionality. Our experiments show that while a state-of-the-art approach fails to address all code vulnerabilities, PromSec effectively resolves them. Moreover, PromSec achieves more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in operation time, number of LLM queries, and security analysis costs. Furthermore, prompts optimized with PromSec for a certain LLM are transferable to other LLMs across programming languages and generalizable to unseen vulnerabilities in training. This study is a step in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs for secure and functional code generation, supporting their integration into real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, CCS 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

| **[What You Say = What You Want? Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Human-Free Automated Prompting for Vision-Language Anomaly Detection: Prompt Optimization with Meta-guiding Prompt Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v4)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Robot Failure Recovery Using Vision-Language Models With Optimized Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03966v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robot autonomy struggles to operate beyond the assumed Operational Design Domain (ODD), the specific set of conditions and environments in which the system is designed to function, while the real-world is rife with uncertainties that may lead to failures. Automating recovery remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods often rely on human intervention to manually address failures or require exhaustive enumeration of failure cases and the design of specific recovery policies for each scenario, both of which are labor-intensive. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which demonstrate remarkable common-sense generalization and reasoning capabilities, have broader, potentially unbounded ODDs. However, limitations in spatial reasoning continue to be a common challenge for many VLMs when applied to robot control and motion-level error recovery. In this paper, we investigate how optimizing visual and text prompts can enhance the spatial reasoning of VLMs, enabling them to function effectively as black-box controllers for both motion-level position correction and task-level recovery from unknown failures. Specifically, the optimizations include identifying key visual elements in visual prompts, highlighting these elements in text prompts for querying, and decomposing the reasoning process for failure detection and control generation. In experiments, prompt optimizations significantly outperform pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models in correcting motion-level position errors and improve accuracy by 65.78% compared to VLMs with unoptimized prompts. Additionally, for task-level failures, optimized prompts enhanced the success rate by 5.8%, 5.8%, and 7.5% in VLMs' abilities to detect failures, analyze issues, and generate recovery plans, respectively, across a wide range of unknown errors in Lego assembly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think Twice Before Recognizing: Large Multimodal Models for General Fine-grained Traffic Sign Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01534v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new strategy called think twice before recognizing to improve fine-grained traffic sign recognition (TSR). Fine-grained TSR in the wild is difficult due to the complex road conditions, and existing approaches particularly struggle with cross-country TSR when data is lacking. Our strategy achieves effective fine-grained TSR by stimulating the multiple-thinking capability of large multimodal models (LMM). We introduce context, characteristic, and differential descriptions to design multiple thinking processes for the LMM. The context descriptions with center coordinate prompt optimization help the LMM to locate the target traffic sign in the original road images containing multiple traffic signs and filter irrelevant answers through the proposed prior traffic sign hypothesis. The characteristic description is based on few-shot in-context learning of template traffic signs, which decreases the cross-domain difference and enhances the fine-grained recognition capability of the LMM. The differential descriptions of similar traffic signs optimize the multimodal thinking capability of the LMM. The proposed method is independent of training data and requires only simple and uniform instructions. We conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and two real-world datasets from different countries, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art TSR results on all five datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiverseDialogue: A Methodology for Designing Chatbots with Human-Like Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00262v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), which simulate human users, are frequently employed to evaluate chatbots in applications such as tutoring and customer service. Effective evaluation necessitates a high degree of human-like diversity within these simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that conversations generated by GPT-4o mini, when used as simulated human participants, systematically differ from those between actual humans across multiple linguistic features. These features include topic variation, lexical attributes, and both the average behavior and diversity (variance) of the language used. To address these discrepancies, we propose an approach that automatically generates prompts for user simulations by incorporating features derived from real human interactions, such as age, gender, emotional tone, and the topics discussed. We assess our approach using differential language analysis combined with deep linguistic inquiry. Our method of prompt optimization, tailored to target specific linguistic features, shows significant improvements. Specifically, it enhances the human-likeness of LLM chatbot conversations, increasing their linguistic diversity. On average, we observe a 54 percent reduction in the error of average features between human and LLM-generated conversations. This method of constructing chatbot sets with human-like diversity holds great potential for enhancing the evaluation process of user-facing bots.</p></details> |  |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |

Existing multimodal fake news detection (MFND) methods can be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are overly dependent on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SuXinqi/DAAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in QA is often undermined by the vagueness of user questions. To address this issue, we introduce single-round instance-level prompt optimization, referred to as question rewriter. By enhancing the intelligibility of human questions for black-box LLMs, our question rewriter improves the quality of generated answers. The rewriter is optimized using direct preference optimization based on feedback collected from automatic criteria for evaluating generated answers; therefore, its training does not require costly human annotations. The experiments across multiple black-box LLMs and long-form question answering (LFQA) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method. This paper provides a practical framework for training question rewriters and sets a precedent for future explorations in prompt optimization within LFQA tasks.

However, most existing prompt optimization methods only focus on the task-level performance, overlooking the importance of query-preferred prompts, which leads to suboptimal performances. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on frequent interactions with LLMs to obtain feedback for guiding the optimization process, incurring substantial redundant interaction costs. In this paper, we introduce Query-dependent Prompt Optimization (QPO), which leverages multi-loop offline reinforcement learning to iteratively fine-tune a small pretrained language model to generate optimal prompts tailored to the input queries, thus significantly improving the prompting effect on the large target LLM. We derive insights from offline prompting demonstration data, which already exists in large quantities as a by-product of benchmarking diverse prompts on open-sourced tasks, thereby circumventing the expenses of online interactions. Furthermore, we continuously augment the offline dataset with the generated prompts in each loop, as the prompts from the fine-tuned model are supposed to outperform the source prompts in the original dataset. These iterative loops bootstrap the model towards generating optimal prompts. Experiments on various LLM scales and diverse NLP and math tasks demonstrate the efficacy and cost-efficiency of our method in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, when migrating to newer, smaller, or weaker models (possibly due to latency or cost gains), prompts need to be updated to re-optimize the task performance. We propose Concept Distillation (CD), an automatic prompt optimization technique for enhancing weaker models on complex tasks. CD involves: (1) collecting mistakes made by weak models with a base prompt (initialization), (2) using a strong model to generate reasons for these mistakes and create rules/concepts for weak models (induction), and (3) filtering these rules based on validation set performance and integrating them into the base prompt (deduction/verification). We evaluated CD on NL2Code and mathematical reasoning tasks, observing significant performance boosts for small and weaker language models. Notably, Mistral-7B's accuracy on Multi-Arith increased by 20%, and Phi-3-mini-3.8B's accuracy on HumanEval rose by 34%. Compared to other automated methods, CD offers an effective, cost-efficient strategy for improving weak models' performance on complex tasks and enables seamless workload migration across different language models without compromising performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

Despite the growing interest in optimizing prompts with few-shot examples, existing methods for prompt optimization are often resource-intensive or perform inadequately. In this work, we propose PrOmpting with Episodic Memory (POEM), a novel prompt optimization technique that is simple, efficient, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. We approach prompt optimization as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) challenge, using episodic memory to archive combinations of input data, permutations of few-shot examples, and the rewards observed during training. In the testing phase, we optimize the sequence of examples for each test query by selecting the sequence that yields the highest total rewards from the top-k most similar training examples in the episodic memory. Our results show that POEM outperforms recent techniques like TEMPERA and RLPrompt by over 5.3% in various text classification tasks. Furthermore, our approach adapts well to broader language understanding tasks, consistently outperforming conventional heuristic methods for ordering examples.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space.

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. As a preliminary exploration, this research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes four different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), human-in-the-Loop LLM (HiLL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient, cost-effective, and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has approached this objective by embedding prompts into language models (LMs). Common methodologies include integrating prompts at the input layer or introducing learnable variables at each transformer layer. Nonetheless, each strategy exhibits inherent limitations. Prompts integrated at the input layer risk underutilization, with their impact potentially diminishing across successive transformer layers. Conversely, the addition of learnable variables to each layer can complicate the training process and increase inference latency. To tackle the issues mentioned above, this paper proposes Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), a plug-and-play architecture designed for zero-shot DST. DualLoRA incorporates two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) components, targeting both dialogue context processing and prompt optimization, to ensure the comprehensive influence of prompts throughout the transformer model layers. This is achieved without incurring additional inference latency, showcasing an efficient integration into existing architectures. Through rigorous evaluation on the MultiWOZ and SGD datasets, DualLoRA demonstrates notable improvements across multiple domains, outperforming traditional baseline methods in zero-shot settings.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPR 2024</p></details> |

One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |

| **[LAPT: Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning for OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08966v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for model reliability, as it identifies samples from unknown classes and reduces errors due to unexpected inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

We worked with the domain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and effective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a human-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset collection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By enhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool for HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02319v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many modern LLM applications, such as retrieval augmented generation, prompts have become programs themselves. In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |

In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[POS: A Prompts Optimization Suite for Augmenting Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00949v3)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper targets to enhance the diffusion-based text-to-video generation by improving the two input prompts, including the noise and the text. Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Prompt Optimizer of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Abstract Concept Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11589v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of text-to-image diffusion models has opened the door of generative AI, enabling the translation of textual descriptions into visually compelling images with remarkable quality. However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |

While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

| **[Harnessing Multi-Role Capabilities of Large Language Models for Open-Domain Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05217v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has emerged as a pivotal research spotlight in information systems. Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |
