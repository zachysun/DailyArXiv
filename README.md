| **[Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08578v3)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.08578v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public health decision-making. This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[TESSERA: Precomputed FAIR Global Pixel Embeddings for Earth Representation and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380v5)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.20380v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Petabytes of satellite Earth Observation (EO) data are freely available and can address critical global challenges. However, EO data quality is poor due to clouds and variable lighting conditions. To address this, practitioners typically use compositing, but this critically removes the temporal phenological signal. Moreover, supervised machine learning to map composited pixels to task-specific classes requires accurately labelled data that are rarely available. We present TESSERA, a pixel-oriented foundation model for EO time series that creates 128-dimensional latent embeddings requiring only a few labels for task-specific training to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse complex tasks. TESSERA uses two encoders that combine optical data with synthetic aperture radar backscatter coefficients at 10m resolution, creating embeddings fused with a multilayer perceptron to generate annual global embedding maps. TESSERA closely matches or outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models across five diverse downstream tasks. It is unprecedented in ease of use, scale, and accuracy: no other open foundation model provides precomputed outputs with global, annual coverage at 10m resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTS-DMAE: Dual-Masked Autoencoder for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16078v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.16078v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDM 2025</p></details> |

We propose an asymmetric fusion strategy starting from a primary modality and integrating secondary modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific information. Validated on a dataset of 239 patients with echocardiographic time series and tabular records, our model outperforms existing methods, achieving an AUC over 90%. This improvement marks a crucial benchmark for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Accepted at MIDL 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13246v3)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.13246v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |

| **[SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15827v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15827v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v5)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.17662v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ThermalGuardian: Temperature-Aware Testing of Automotive Deep Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15815v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15815v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Channel-Imposed Fusion: A Simple yet Effective Method for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00337v2)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.00337v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Temporal Dependencies within the Target for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04777v3)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.04777v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in LTSF research, we identify a performance bottleneck in existing LTSF methods caused by the inadequate modeling of Temporal Dependencies within the Target (TDT). To address this issue, we propose a novel and generic temporal modeling framework, Temporal Dependency Alignment (TDAlign), that equips existing LTSF methods with TDT learning capabilities. TDAlign introduces two key innovations: 1) a loss function that aligns the change values between adjacent time steps in the predictions with those in the target, ensuring consistency with variation patterns, and 2) an adaptive loss balancing strategy that seamlessly integrates the new loss function with existing LTSF methods without introducing additional learnable parameters. As a plug-and-play framework, TDAlign enhances existing methods with minimal computational overhead, featuring only linear time complexity and constant space complexity relative to the prediction length. Extensive experiments on six strong LTSF baselines across seven real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TDAlign. On average, TDAlign reduces baseline prediction errors by \textbf{1.47\%} to \textbf{9.19\%} and change value errors by \textbf{4.57\%} to \textbf{15.78\%}, highlighting its substantial performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

The work used feature-rich synthetic dataset experiments in Docker, which acted like production environments that processed 100 to 500 records per batch and 6 to 12 requests per batch in parallel. Efforts have been concentrated in the areas of better query plans, cached execution plans, parallel processing, and resource management. The experimental results show that OpenMLDB can support approximately 12,500 QPS with less than 1 ms latency, outperforming SparkSQL and ClickHouse by a factor of 23 and PostgreSQL and MySQL by 3.57 times. This study assessed the impact of optimization and showed that query plan optimization accounted for 35% of the performance gains, caching for 25%, and parallel processing for 20%. These results illustrate OpenMLDB's capability for time-sensitive ML use cases, such as fraud detection, personalized recommendation, and time series forecasting. The system's modular optimization framework, which combines batch and stream processing without interference, contributes to its significant performance gain over traditional database systems, particularly in applications that require real-time feature computation and serving. This study contributes to the understanding and design of high-performance SQL+ML systems and highlights the need for specialized SQL optimization for ML workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[DPANet: Dual Pyramid Attention Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14868v2)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.14868v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is hampered by the challenge of modeling complex dependencies that span multiple temporal scales and frequency resolutions. Existing methods, including Transformer and MLP-based models, often struggle to capture these intertwined characteristics in a unified and structured manner. We propose the Dual Pyramid Attention Network (DPANet), a novel architecture that explicitly decouples and concurrently models temporal multi-scale dynamics and spectral multi-resolution periodicities. DPANet constructs two parallel pyramids: a Temporal Pyramid built on progressive downsampling, and a Frequency Pyramid built on band-pass filtering. The core of our model is the Cross-Pyramid Fusion Block, which facilitates deep, interactive information exchange between corresponding pyramid levels via cross-attention. This fusion proceeds in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enabling global context to guide local representation learning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DPANet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior models. Code is available at https://github.com/hit636/DPANet.</p></details> |  |

We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Positional Encoding in Transformer-Based Time Series Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12370v2)** | 2025-09-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.12370v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in transformer-based models have greatly improved time series analysis, providing robust solutions for tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. A crucial element of these models is positional encoding, which allows transformers to capture the intrinsic sequential nature of time series data. This survey systematically examines existing techniques for positional encoding in transformer-based time series models. We investigate a variety of methods, including fixed, learnable, relative, and hybrid approaches, and evaluate their effectiveness in different time series classification tasks. Our findings indicate that data characteristics like sequence length, signal complexity, and dimensionality significantly influence method effectiveness. Advanced positional encoding methods exhibit performance gains in terms of prediction accuracy, however, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity. Furthermore, we outline key challenges and suggest potential research directions to enhance positional encoding strategies. By delivering a comprehensive overview and quantitative benchmarking, this survey intends to assist researchers and practitioners in selecting and designing effective positional encoding methods for transformer-based time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349v2)** | 2025-09-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.11349v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent time-series foundation models exhibit strong abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context, without knowledge of the underlying physics. Here, we show that foundation models often forecast through a simple parroting strategy, and when they are not parroting they exhibit some shared failure modes such as converging to the mean. As a result, a naive context parroting model that copies directly from the context scores higher than leading time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, including low-dimensional chaos, turbulence, coupled oscillators, and electrocardiograms -- and at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains recent works showing that large language models can often be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the underlying chaotic attractor, providing insight into previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. By revealing the performance gaps and failure modes of current time-series foundation models, context parroting can guide the design of future foundation models and help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New experiments on SciML tasks and other improvements</p></details> |

This paper introduces SPH-Net (Stock Price Prediction Hybrid Neural Network), an innovative deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy of time series forecasting in financial markets. The proposed architecture employs a novel co-attention mechanism that initially processes temporal patterns through a Vision Transformer, followed by refined feature extraction via an attention mechanism, thereby capturing both global and local dependencies in market data. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments on eight diverse stock datasets: AMD, Ebay, Facebook, FirstService Corp, Tesla, Google, Mondi ADR, and Matador Resources. Each dataset is standardized using six fundamental market indicators: Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, representing a complete set of features for comprehensive market analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that SPH-Net consistently outperforms existing stock prediction models across all evaluation metrics. The model's superior performance stems from its ability to effectively capture complex temporal patterns while maintaining robustness against market noise. By significantly improving prediction accuracy in financial time series analysis, SPH-Net provides valuable decision-support capabilities for investors and financial analysts, potentially enabling more informed investment strategies and risk assessment in volatile market conditions.</p></details> |  |

Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that (i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns while remaining robust under weak periodicity.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of health agents to fulfill the diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices and common personal health records, and provide personalized health recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate, personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10 benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible to everyone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor updates to the manuscript (V2)</p></details> |

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several forceful tool use experiments.</p></details> |  |

It replaces deep architectures with simple frequency-specialized linear experts, trained on resampled data across multiple frequency regimes. A lightweight spectral gating mechanism dynamically selects relevant experts, enabling efficient, accurate forecasting.

Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM. Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to 92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%, respectively, demonstrating the practical benefits of clustering when TMs are used for network optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICMLA 2025</p></details> |

Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in 11 out of 12 metric--dataset combinations, consistently outperforming baselines. Unlike conventional deep learning models that output buy-or-sell signals without interpretable justification, our approach enables transparent decision-making by revealing the underlying pattern structures that drive predictive outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted at ACM CIKM 2025 conference</p></details> |

In multivariate time series data, an anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally) independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics, and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components are trained jointly in a latent space using a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to learn meaningful feature representations to separate normal and anomaly samples.</p></details> |  |

Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates) provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically, we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.</p></details> |  |

We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 algorithm.

Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025 (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |

This temporal variability severely impairs the generalization of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Existing frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions of short- and long-term dependencies, making them susceptible to spurious correlations that degrade generalization. To address these limitations, we propose DeCoP, a Dependency Controlled Pre-training framework that explicitly models dynamic, multi-scale dependencies by simulating evolving inter-patch dependencies. At the input level, DeCoP introduces Instance-wise Patch Normalization (IPN) to mitigate distributional shifts while preserving the unique characteristics of each patch, creating a robust foundation for representation learning. At the latent level, a hierarchical Dependency Controlled Learning (DCL) strategy explicitly models inter-patch dependencies across multiple temporal scales, with an Instance-level Contrastive Module (ICM) enhances global generalization by learning instance-discriminative representations from time-invariant positive pairs. DeCoP achieves state-of-the-art results on ten datasets with lower computing resources, improving MSE by 3% on ETTh1 over PatchTST using only 37% of the FLOPs.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is particularly problematic for time series analysis, where signals exhibit complex, non-stationary dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We introduce Dynamic Wavelet Positional Encoding (DyWPE), a novel signal-aware framework that generates positional embeddings directly from input time series using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Comprehensive experiments in ten diverse time series datasets demonstrate that DyWPE consistently outperforms eight existing state-of-the-art positional encoding methods, achieving average relative improvements of 9.1\% compared to baseline sinusoidal absolute position encoding in biomedical signals, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Fourier neural networks (FNNs) attempt to address this by embedding Fourier series components, yet many real-world signals are almost-periodic with non-commensurate frequencies, posing additional challenges. Building on prior work showing that ARIMA outperforms large language models (LLMs) for forecasting, we extend the comparison to neural predictors and find ARIMA still superior. We therefore propose the Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (AR-KAN), which integrates a pre-trained AR module for temporal memory with a KAN for nonlinear representation. The AR module preserves essential temporal features while reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that AR-KAN matches ARIMA on almost-periodic functions and achieves the best results on $72\%$ of Rdatasets series, with a clear advantage on data with periodic structure. These results highlight AR-KAN as a robust and effective framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Yet recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) forecasters seldom adopt these representation approaches because they have shown little performance advantage. We challenge this view and demonstrate that explicit representation alignment can supply critical information that bridges the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that learns auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeds them back to any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arises primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. We also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of TimeAlign in increasing the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets. As it is architecture-agnostic and incurs negligible overhead, TimeAlign can serve as a general alignment module for modern deep learning time-series forecasting systems. The code is available at https://github.com/TROUBADOUR000/TimeAlign.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</p></details> |  |

Yet, little is known about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs) as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

We address this by reframing jamming mitigation as dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal graph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal deviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment is represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked satellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth, elevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM (HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a short history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly correction. We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer profiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each exercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per scenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series baselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm (GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and 4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode datasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10), outperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN. A split study shows superior data efficiency: with only 10\% training data our approach remains well ahead of baselines (20 cm vs. 36-42 cm).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

At the same time, the existing transmission grid is often already congested, and urgently needed reinforcements are frequently delayed due to several constraints. To address these challenges, adjusting the grid topology based on congestion patterns is considered a non-costly remedy to guarantee efficient power transmission. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a grid topology optimization model combining optimal transmission switching and busbar splitting for AC and hybrid AC/DC grids. The methodology incorporates RES forecast uncertainty through a scenario-based stochastic optimization approach, using real offshore wind data and K-means clustering to generate representative forecast error scenarios. The proposed model includes several formulations to be compared with a plain optimal power flow (OPF) model: hourly optimizing the topology, one topology for 24 hours, or a limited number of switching actions over a day. The grid topology optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Problem, optimized based on the day-ahead (D-1) RES forecast and validated for AC-feasibility via an AC-OPF formulation. Based on the generation setpoints of the feasibility check, a redispatch simulation based on the measured (D) RES realization is then computed. The methodology is tested on an AC 30-bus test case and a hybrid AC/DC 50-bus test case, for a 24-hours (30-bus) and a 14-days (both test cases) time series. The results highlight the economic benefits brought by grid topology optimization for congested test cases with high penetration of RES. In addition, the results demonstrate that accounting for RES uncertainty with at least 6 to 8 scenarios leads to lower or comparable total costs to deterministic day-ahead forecasts, even when limiting the frequency of topological actions.</p></details> |  |

Their success demonstrates that large-scale pretraining across diverse domains can acquire the inductive bias to generalize from temporal patterns in a brief history. However, most TSFMs are unable to leverage covariates -- future-available exogenous variables critical for accurate forecasting in many applications -- due to their domain-specific nature and the lack of associated inductive bias. We propose TFMAdapter, a lightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate information without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on the limited history provided during a single model call, learning a non-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts. However, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the history, requiring too many calls to the TSFM. To enable training on the full historical context while limiting TSFM invocations, TFMAdapter uses a two-stage method: (1) generating pseudo-forecasts with a simple regression model, and (2) training a Gaussian Process regressor to refine predictions using both pseudo- and TSFM forecasts alongside covariates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFMAdapter consistently outperforms both foundation models and supervised baselines, achieving a 24-27\% improvement over base foundation models with minimal data and computational overhead. Our results highlight the potential of lightweight adapters to bridge the gap between generic foundation models and domain-specific forecasting needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CIKM 2025</p></details> |

With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work, we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55 in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model provided a more precise detection of causal interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility, strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal discovery in time-series data.</p></details> |  |

This success has motivated increasing efforts to explore foundation models for addressing time series modeling challenges. Although some tutorials and surveys were published in the early stages of this field, the rapid pace of recent developments necessitates a more comprehensive and in-depth synthesis to cover the latest advances. Our survey aims to fill this gap by introducing a modality-aware, challenge-oriented perspective, which reveals how foundation models pre-trained on different modalities face distinct hurdles when adapted to time series tasks. Building on this perspective, we propose a taxonomy of existing works organized by pre-training modality (time series, language, and vision), analyze modality-specific challenges and categorize corresponding solutions, discussing their advantages and limitations.

Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses fully supervised learning in scenarios with limited data and few subjects, and matches its performance in regimes with many subjects. Furthermore, our results underline the relevance of frequency information for sleep stage scoring, while also demonstrating that deep neural networks utilize information beyond frequencies to enhance sleep staging performance, which is consistent with previous research.

The goal is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such as glucose, changes over time and how these changes may reflect the progression of chronic diseases such as diabetes. We introduce a probabilistic model based on a Gaussian mixture that captures the evolution of a continuous-time stochastic process. Our approach combines a nonparametric estimate of the distribution, obtained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) that governs the temporal evolution of the mixture weights. The model is highly interpretable, detects subtle distribution shifts, and remains computationally efficient. We illustrate the broad utility of our approach in a 26-week clinical trial that treats all continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time series as the primary outcome. This method enables rigorous longitudinal comparisons between the treatment and control arms and yields characterizations that conventional summary-based clinical trials analytical methods typically do not capture.</p></details> |  |

There are also visible breakpoints indicating that the linear trend is not universally applicable and that the growing security debt may be stabilizing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SecITC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatiotemporal graph neural process for reconstruction, extrapolation, and classification of cardiac trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12953v1)** | 2025-09-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.12953v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.</p></details> |  |

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeCluster with PCA is Equivalent to Subspace Identification of Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12895v1)** | 2025-09-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.12895v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification (block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying trends in corrupted data.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, work originally done in 2022/2023 and was awarded as one of the Regeneron Science Talent Search Finalists in 2022</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Representations of Time Series Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12650v1)** | 2025-09-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.12650v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and foundation model-based methods.</p></details> | 10 pages,8 figures |

These are extensively used also in operating systems and their kernels, including the Linux kernel. The paper fills a gap in existing knowledge by empirically examining the longitudinal evolution of assertion use in the Linux kernel. According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth release series. At the same time, the use of softer assertion variants has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce warnings. With these time series results, the paper contributes to the existing but limited empirical knowledge base about operating system kernels and their long-term evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Testing Software and Systems (ICTSS 2025), Limassol, Springer, pp. 3-15</p></details> |

A cross-modal deep metric learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify different time series features. The inner product of principal component direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection speed, and strong robustness.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion models have shown to be effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Paper has been accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes, while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns, while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a single unified network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196v1)** | 2025-09-15 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.12196v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080v1)** | 2025-09-15 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.12080v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |

Current methods track fetal motion by predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings.

Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at the 39th conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

The approach employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20 train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams provided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE, further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic forecasting. Beyond rainfall, the proposed WST framework offers a scalable methodology for forecasting complex environmental time series, with direct implications for flood risk management, water resources planning, and climate adaptation strategies in data-sparse and climate-sensitive regions.</p></details> |  |

However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  |

It is well known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance. However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically, it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir structure and the periodicity of the dataset.</p></details> |  |

This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Second, there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack, as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted, starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications, and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional A/B testing remains constrained by its dependence on the large-scale and live traffic of human participants, and the long time of waiting for the testing result. Through formative interviews with six experienced industry practitioners, we identified critical bottlenecks in current A/B testing workflows. In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents Amazon.com, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale. Our findings suggest AgentA/B can emulate human-like behavior patterns.</p></details> |  |

But what about evaluating and iterating the usability testing study design itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM Agent) research inspired us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and iterating their study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users and to interactively test the target website. The system also provides a Result Viewer Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative (e.g., agents' post-study surveys) and quantitative data (e.g., agents' interaction logs), or even interview agents directly. Through a heuristic evaluation with 16 UX researchers, participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing benchmarks lack comprehensiveness and are challenging to scale and adapt across different cultural contexts, because their frameworks often lack guidance from well-established cultural theories and tend to rely on expert-driven manual annotations. To address these issues, we propose CultureScope, the most comprehensive evaluation framework to date for assessing cultural understanding in LLMs. Inspired by the cultural iceberg theory, we design a novel dimensional schema for cultural knowledge classification, comprising 3 layers and 140 dimensions, which guides the automated construction of culture-specific knowledge bases and corresponding evaluation datasets for any given languages and cultures. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively evaluate cultural understanding. They also reveal that existing large language models lack comprehensive cultural competence, and merely incorporating multilingual data does not necessarily enhance cultural understanding.

A critical component of these systems is the Tool Invocation Prompt (TIP), which defines tool interaction protocols and guides LLMs to ensure the security and correctness of tool usage. Despite its importance, TIP security has been largely overlooked. This work investigates TIP-related security risks, revealing that major LLM-based systems like Cursor, Claude Code, and others are vulnerable to attacks such as remote code execution (RCE) and denial of service (DoS). Through a systematic TIP exploitation workflow (TEW), we demonstrate external tool behavior hijacking via manipulated tool invocations.

However, a comparison of various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking. While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations, label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

By supporting reconfiguration at the functional unit level, CGRAs efficiently adapt to varying computational patterns and optimize resource utilization. However, designing CGRAs is highly challenging due to the vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and the time-consuming nature of manual design. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to automate this process. In this work, we propose MACO -- an open-source multi-agent LLM-based framework for Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design of CGRAs. The framework employs LLM reasoning to generate CGRAs across four stages: HW/SW co-design, Design error correction, Best design selection, and Evaluation & Feedback. Furthermore, MACO iteratively optimizes the generated CGRAs, leveraging agent reasoning and feedback to achieve higher PPA (that is, power, performance, and area) design points for a given domain. In addition, we introduce an LLM self-learning mechanism that employs LLM-driven decision making to select the optimal CGRA to accelerate the design process. We evaluate the framework with state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and manual CGRA design, in terms of performance, power consumption, and area. Experimental results show that MACO efficiently generates high-quality CGRA architectures, significantly reducing manual design effort and demonstrating the potential of our framework for real-world CGRA design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to certain confidentiality requirements, this article needs to be withdrawn</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps: they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1) Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025, spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2) Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3) Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30 state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress with multiple golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These results highlight the performance gap between open-source models and top students, the strong reasoning abilities of closed-source models, and the remaining room for improvement. HiPhO, a human-aligned Olympiad benchmark for multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO with a public leaderboard at https://phyarena.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector, SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in the out-of-domain setting.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |

Standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture semantic correctness, and current LLM-based evaluators often reduce nuanced aspects of answer quality into a single undifferentiated score. We introduce DeCE, a decomposed LLM evaluation framework that separates precision (factual accuracy and relevance) and recall (coverage of required concepts), using instance-specific criteria automatically extracted from gold answer requirements. DeCE is model-agnostic and domain-general, requiring no predefined taxonomies or handcrafted rubrics. We instantiate DeCE to evaluate different LLMs on a real-world legal QA task involving multi-jurisdictional reasoning and citation grounding. DeCE achieves substantially stronger correlation with expert judgments ($r=0.78$), compared to traditional metrics ($r=0.12$), pointwise LLM scoring ($r=0.35$), and modern multidimensional evaluators ($r=0.48$). It also reveals interpretable trade-offs: generalist models favor recall, while specialized models favor precision. Importantly, only 11.95% of LLM-generated criteria required expert revision, underscoring DeCE's scalability. DeCE offers an interpretable and actionable LLM evaluation framework in expert domains.</p></details> |  |

We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.</p></details> |  |

Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.</p></details> |  |

These errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL) and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions. First, we study how each methods performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as: Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon, Adel Daoud, Connor T.

This study introduces a framework to evaluate sycophantic behavior in ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Pro across AMPS (mathematics) and MedQuad (medical advice) datasets. Sycophantic behavior was observed in 58.19% of cases, with Gemini exhibiting the highest rate (62.47%) and ChatGPT the lowest (56.71%). Progressive sycophancy, leading to correct answers, occurred in 43.52% of cases, while regressive sycophancy, leading to incorrect answers, was observed in 14.66%. Preemptive rebuttals demonstrated significantly higher sycophancy rates than in-context rebuttals (61.75% vs. 56.52%, $Z=5.87$, $p<0.001$), particularly in computational tasks, where regressive sycophancy increased significantly (preemptive: 8.13%, in-context: 3.54%, $p<0.001$). Simple rebuttals maximized progressive sycophancy ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$), while citation-based rebuttals exhibited the highest regressive rates ($Z=6.59$, $p<0.001$). Sycophantic behavior showed high persistence (78.5%, 95% CI: [77.2%, 79.8%]) regardless of context or model. These findings emphasize the risks and opportunities of deploying LLMs in structured and dynamic domains, offering insights into prompt programming and model optimization for safer AI applications.</p></details> | AIES 2025 |

A key characteristic of these contexts is that activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover, despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision agriculture scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, their high autonomy and opaque reasoning processes pose significant challenges for traditional software observability methods. To address this, we introduce the concept of cognitive observability - the ability to recover and inspect the implicit reasoning behind agent decisions. We present Watson, a general-purpose framework for observing the reasoning processes of fast-thinking LLM agents without altering their behavior. Watson retroactively infers reasoning traces using prompt attribution techniques. We evaluate Watson in both manual debugging and automated correction scenarios across the MMLU benchmark and the AutoCodeRover and OpenHands agents on the SWE-bench-lite dataset. In both static and dynamic settings, Watson surfaces actionable reasoning insights and supports targeted interventions, demonstrating its practical utility for improving transparency and reliability in Agentware systems.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining. Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs without altering their original architectures or introducing significant computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture contextualized information even without attending to future tokens. Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared to best-performing methods.</p></details> |  |

While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

However, existing meta-evaluation benchmarks are static, outdated, and lacking in multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to fully capture subtle weaknesses in evaluation. We introduce MEDAL, an automated multi-agent framework for curating more representative and diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues, conditioned on varied seed contexts. Then, a strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is used for a multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. Using MEDAL, we uncover that state-of-the-art judges fail to reliably detect nuanced issues such as lack of empathy, commonsense, or relevance.</p></details> | October ARR |

In this work, we investigate cognitive biases as black-box adversarial strategies, drawing parallels between their effects on LLMs and human purchasing behavior. Through extensive evaluation across models of varying scale, we find that certain biases, such as social proof, consistently boost product recommendation rate and ranking, while others, like scarcity and exclusivity, surprisingly reduce visibility. Our results demonstrate that cognitive biases are deeply embedded in state-of-the-art LLMs, leading to highly unpredictable behavior in product recommendations and posing significant challenges for effective mitigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Thus, companies continuously build large-scale GPU clusters, and launch training jobs that span over thousands of computing nodes. However, LLM pre-training presents unique challenges due to its complex communication patterns, where GPUs exchange data in sparse yet high-volume bursts within specific groups. Inefficient resource scheduling exacerbates bandwidth contention, leading to suboptimal training performance. This paper presents Arnold, a scheduling system summarizing our experience to effectively align LLM communication patterns with data center topology at scale. An in-depth characteristic study is performed to identify the impact of physical network topology to LLM pre-training jobs. Based on the insights, we develop a scheduling algorithm to effectively align communication patterns with the physical network topology in modern data centers. Through simulation experiments, we show the effectiveness of our algorithm in reducing the maximum spread of communication groups by up to $1.67$x. In production training, our scheduling system improves the end-to-end performance by $10.6\%$ when training with more than $9600$ GPUs, a significant improvement for our training pipeline.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

A principal obstacle is that most models output a single score without any accompanying measure of confidence or explanation. We address this gap with conformal prediction, a distribution-free wrapper that equips any classifier with set-valued outputs and formal coverage guarantees. Two open-source large language models (Llama-3 8B and Qwen-2.5 3B) are fine-tuned on three diverse corpora (ASAP, TOEFL11, Cambridge-FCE) and calibrated at a 90 percent risk level. Reliability is assessed with UAcc, an uncertainty-aware accuracy that rewards models for being both correct and concise. To our knowledge, this is the first work to combine conformal prediction and UAcc for essay scoring. The calibrated models consistently meet the coverage target while keeping prediction sets compact, indicating that open-source, mid-sized LLMs can already support teacher-in-the-loop AES; we discuss scaling and broader user studies as future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference).

To support this analysis, we introduce a multilingual QA dataset MultiOCR-QA, comprising 50K question-answer pairs across three languages, English, French, and German. The dataset is curated from OCR-ed historical documents, which include different levels and types of OCR noise. We then evaluate how different state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) perform under different error conditions, focusing on three major OCR error types.

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels, which enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under continuous improvement</p></details> |

However, their application to machine translation (MT) remains underexplored due to the lack of systematic methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating, and deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla preference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically generating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for fine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model benchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling architectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures fine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our MT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level and sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs without additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in hypothesis ensembling. Our work provides valuable insights into the role of reward models in MT research.

Evaluating Non-Linear Reasoning via Argumentation Theory Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15739v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15739v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at linear reasoning tasks but remain underexplored on non-linear structures such as those found in natural debates, which are best expressed as argument graphs. We evaluate whether LLMs can approximate structured reasoning from Computational Argumentation Theory (CAT). Specifically, we use Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) semantics, which assigns acceptability scores to arguments based on their attack and support relations. Given only dialogue-formatted debates from two NoDE datasets, models are prompted to rank arguments without access to the underlying graph. We test several LLMs under advanced instruction strategies, including Chain-of-Thought and In-Context Learning. While models show moderate alignment with QuAD rankings, performance degrades with longer inputs or disrupted discourse flow. Advanced prompting helps mitigate these effects by reducing biases related to argument length and position. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLMs in modeling formal argumentation semantics and motivate future work on graph-aware reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods treat all item tokens equally, simply pursuing likelihood maximization during both optimization and decoding. This overlooks crucial token-level differences in decisiveness-many tokens contribute little to item discrimination yet can dominate optimization or decoding. To quantify token decisiveness, we propose a novel perspective that models item generation as a decision process, measuring token decisiveness by the Information Gain (IG) each token provides in reducing uncertainty about the generated item. Our empirical analysis reveals that most tokens have low IG but often correspond to high logits, disproportionately influencing training loss and decoding, which may impair model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce an Information Gain-based Decisiveness-aware Token handling (IGD) strategy that integrates token decisiveness into both tuning and decoding. Specifically, IGD downweights low-IG tokens during tuning and rebalances decoding to emphasize tokens with high IG. In this way, IGD moves beyond pure likelihood maximization, effectively prioritizing high-decisiveness tokens. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with two LLM backbones demonstrate that IGD consistently improves recommendation accuracy, achieving significant gains on widely used ranking metrics compared to strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs in the SOC: An Empirical Study of Human-AI Collaboration in Security Operations Centres](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18947v2)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.18947v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Security Operations Centres (SOCs) presents a transformative, yet still evolving, opportunity to reduce analyst workload through human-AI collaboration. However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[CARD: A Cache-Assisted Parallel Speculative Decoding Framework via Query-and-Correct Paradigm for Accelerating LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04462v2)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.04462v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding (SD), where a draft model provides multiple candidate tokens for the target model to verify in parallel, has demonstrated significant potential for accelerating LLM inference. Yet, existing SD approaches adhere to a strict draft-then-verify paradigm, enforcing a sequential process that hampers performance and constrains the draft model's capacity. Moreover, rejecting a token in the candidate sequence invalidates all subsequent tokens, leading to wasted computation during drafting. To overcome these limitations, we propose a cache-assisted parallel speculative decoding framework called CARD, which employs a novel query-and-correct paradigm. Our approach decouples drafting from verification: the draft model populates a shared cache with candidate tokens, while the target model concurrently refines the draft's trajectory. This enables inference at near-draft-speed, effectively leveraging the draft model's efficiency without additional fine-tuning. Experimental results show that CARD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 4.83x acceleration over vanilla autoregressive decoding, with no fine-tuning required for either models.</p></details> |  |

Results show that model scale is the primary driver of performance: larger LLMs achieve strong zero-shot results, while few-shot prompting yields only marginal improvements. In contrast, terminology-aware cues and embedding-based example retrieval consistently improve domain-specific translation. These findings underscore both the promise and the current limitations of multilingual LLMs for medical En-Vi MT.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work is under peer review</p></details> |

However, conventional supervised fine-tuning approaches for specializing LLMs in ranking tasks often lead to significant degradation of the models' general-purpose abilities. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper presents a novel methodology that strategically combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques with an innovative two-stage training pipeline consisting of Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Ranking Preference Optimization (SFT-RPO). The Chain-of-Thought prompting component encourages models to explicitly articulate their reasoning process during ranking decisions, creating a transparent pathway from query-document analysis to final ranking scores while maintaining analytical capabilities throughout fine-tuning. Extensive experimental evaluations on the TREC Deep Learning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, including RankZephyr, showing consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics such as normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). Most significantly, comprehensive assessments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark reveal that our method successfully maintains robust performance across diverse reasoning tasks, providing strong empirical evidence for effective retention of general-purpose capabilities through strategic fine-tuning while achieving specialized performance improvements in text reranking.</p></details> |  |

Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres. By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an average of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing detection method.

However, writing these high-performance ML libraries is challenging because it requires expert knowledge of ML algorithms and the ASPL. Large language models (LLMs), on the other hand, have shown general coding capabilities. However, challenges remain when using LLMs for generating ML libraries using ASPLs because 1) this task is complicated even for experienced human programmers and 2) there are limited code examples because of the esoteric and evolving nature of ASPLs. Therefore, LLMs need complex reasoning with limited data in order to complete this task. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive self-improvement agentic system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we construct a benchmark of a typical ML library and generate ASPL code with both open and closed-source LLMs on this benchmark. Our results show improvements of up to $3.9\times$ over a baseline single LLM.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979v2)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.14979v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages.

Existing methods for enhancing cross-lingual transfer remain constrained by parallel resources, suffering from limited linguistic and domain coverage. We propose Cross-lingual In-context Pre-training (CrossIC-PT), a simple and scalable approach that enhances cross-lingual transfer by leveraging semantically related bilingual texts via simple next-word prediction. We construct CrossIC-PT samples by interleaving semantic-related bilingual Wikipedia documents into a single context window. To access window size constraints, we implement a systematic segmentation policy to split long bilingual document pairs into chunks while adjusting the sliding window mechanism to preserve contextual coherence. We further extend data availability through a semantic retrieval framework to construct CrossIC-PT samples from web-crawled corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that CrossIC-PT improves multilingual performance on three models (Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-1.5B) across six target languages, yielding performance gains of 3.79%, 3.99%, and 1.95%, respectively, with additional improvements after data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the BISAC book classification system to provide a comprehensive hierarchical topic organization, and then employs a debate mechanism with multiple LLMs to generate diverse, high-quality topics within this structure. For each topic, we use lightweight BM25 retrieval to obtain relevant documents and concatenate them into 128K-token training samples. Experiments on HELMET and Ruler benchmarks demonstrate that LiteLong achieves competitive long-context performance and can seamlessly integrate with other long-dependency enhancement methods. LiteLong makes high-quality long-context data synthesis more accessible by reducing both computational and data engineering costs, facilitating further research in long-context language training.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, achieving human-level multi-perspective understanding and judgment remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Roundtable Essay Scoring (RES), a multi-agent evaluation framework designed to perform precise and human-aligned scoring under a zero-shot setting. RES constructs evaluator agents based on LLMs, each tailored to a specific prompt and topic context. Each agent independently generates a trait-based rubric and conducts a multi-perspective evaluation. Then, by simulating a roundtable-style discussion, RES consolidates individual evaluations through a dialectical reasoning process to produce a final holistic score that more closely aligns with human evaluation. By enabling collaboration and consensus among agents with diverse evaluation perspectives, RES outperforms prior zero-shot AES approaches. Experiments on the ASAP dataset using ChatGPT and Claude show that RES achieves up to a 34.86% improvement in average QWK over straightforward prompting (Vanilla) methods.</p></details> |  |

Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility.

Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.</p></details> |  |

Previous works often assume uniform query sizes. Heterogeneous query sizes introduce a combinatorial structure for cache selection, making the cache replacement process more computationally and statistically challenging. We treat optimal cache selection as a knapsack problem and employ an accumulation-based strategy to effectively balance computational overhead and cache updates. In theoretical analysis, we prove that the regret of our algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{MNT})$ bound, improving the coefficient of $\sqrt{MN}$ compared to the $O(MN\sqrt{T})$ result in Berkeley, where $N$ is the total number of queries and $M$ is the cache size. Additionally, we also provide a problem-dependent bound, which was absent in previous works. The experiment rely on real-world data show that our algorithm reduces the total cost by approximately 12\%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets are primarily designed for traditional machine learning methods and are inadequate for LLM-based methods, in terms of corpus selection and overall dataset design logic. Moreover, the prevalent fixed and relatively coarse-grained entity categorization in existing datasets fails to adequately assess the superior generalization and contextual understanding capabilities of LLM-based methods, thereby hindering a comprehensive demonstration of their broad application prospects. To address these limitations, we propose DynamicNER, the first NER dataset designed for LLM-based methods with dynamic categorization, introducing various entity types and entity type lists for the same entity in different context, leveraging the generalization of LLM-based NER better.

Generative large language models trained to align with human goals have achieved high zero-shot performance across a wide variety of tasks. As of yet, it is unclear how well these models perform on biomedical relation extraction (RE). To address this knowledge gap, we explore patterns in the performance of OpenAI LLMs across a diverse sampling of RE tasks. Methods: We use OpenAI GPT-4-turbo and OpenAI's reasoning models o1 and GPT-OSS to conduct end-to-end RE experiments on seven datasets. We use the JSON generation capabilities of GPT models to generate structured output in two ways: (1) by defining an explicit schema describing the structure of relations, and (2) using a setting that infers the structure from the prompt language. Results: Our work is the first to study and compare the performance of the GPT-4, o1 and GPT-OSS for the end-to-end zero-shot biomedical RE task across a broad array of datasets. We found the zero-shot performances to be proximal to that of fine-tuned methods. The limitations of this approach are that it performs poorly on instances containing many relations and errs on the boundaries of textual mentions.

Biber's multidimensional analysis (MDA) is applied to a sample of human-written texts and AI-created texts generated to be their counterparts to find the dimensions of variation in which LLMs differ most significantly and most systematically from humans. As textual material, a new LLM-generated corpus AI-Brown is used, which is comparable to BE-21 (a Brown family corpus representing contemporary British English). Since all languages except English are underrepresented in the training data of frontier LLMs, similar analysis is replicated on Czech using AI-Koditex corpus and Czech multidimensional model. Examined were 16 frontier models in various settings and prompts, with emphasis placed on the difference between base models and instruction-tuned models. Based on this, a benchmark is created through which models can be compared with each other and ranked in interpretable dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data and scripts: https://osf.io/hs7xt/.

The standard training procedure for CBMs is to predefine a candidate set of human-interpretable concepts, extract their values from the training data, and identify a sparse subset as inputs to a transparent prediction model. However, such approaches are often hampered by the tradeoff between exploring a sufficiently large set of concepts versus controlling the cost of obtaining concept extractions, resulting in a large interpretability-accuracy tradeoff. This work investigates a novel approach that sidesteps these challenges: BC-LLM iteratively searches over a potentially infinite set of concepts within a Bayesian framework, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as both a concept extraction mechanism and prior. Even though LLMs can be miscalibrated and hallucinate, we prove that BC-LLM can provide rigorous statistical inference and uncertainty quantification. Across image, text, and tabular datasets, BC-LLM outperforms interpretable baselines and even black-box models in certain settings, converges more rapidly towards relevant concepts, and is more robust to out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2 bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline, with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability), a novel method analyzing internal representational stability in LLMs. CCPS applies targeted adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, extracts features reflecting the model's response to these perturbations, and uses a lightweight classifier to predict answer correctness. CCPS was evaluated on LLMs from 8B to 32B parameters (covering Llama, Qwen, and Mistral architectures) using MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our results show that CCPS significantly outperforms current approaches. Across four LLMs and three MMLU variants, CCPS reduces Expected Calibration Error by approximately 55% and Brier score by 21%, while increasing accuracy by 5 percentage points, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve by 4 percentage points, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve by 6 percentage points, all relative to the strongest prior method. CCPS delivers an efficient, broadly applicable, and more accurate solution for estimating LLM confidence, thereby improving their trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |

The widespread availability of LLMs, coupled with their varying strengths and out-of-the-box usability, has profoundly advanced the field of LLM Ensemble. This paper presents the first systematic review of recent developments in LLM Ensemble. First, we introduce our taxonomy of LLM Ensemble and discuss several related research problems. Then, we provide a more in-depth classification of the methods under the broad categories of "ensemble-before-inference, ensemble-during-inference, ensemble-after-inference'', and review all relevant methods.

We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Many studies found preferences for left-leaning positions in LLMs, but downstream effects on tasks like fact-checking remain underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate political bias through exchanging words with euphemisms or dysphemisms in German claims. We construct minimal pairs of factually equivalent claims that differ in political connotation, to assess the consistency of LLMs in classifying them as true or false. We evaluate six LLMs and find that, more than political leaning, the presence of judgmental words significantly influences truthfulness assessment. While a few models show tendencies of political bias, this is not mitigated by explicitly calling for objectivism in prompts.</p></details> |  |

Despite these potential benefits, the integrated XR-LLM pipeline makes XR applications vulnerable to new forms of attacks. In this paper, we analyze LLM-Integated XR systems in the literature and in practice and categorize them along different dimensions from a systems perspective. Building on this categorization, we identify a common threat model and demonstrate a series of proof-of-concept attacks on multiple XR platforms that employ various LLM models (Meta Quest 3, Meta Ray-Ban, Android, and Microsoft HoloLens 2 running Llama and GPT models). Although these platforms each implement LLM integration differently, they share vulnerabilities where an attacker can modify the public context surrounding a legitimate LLM query, resulting in erroneous visual or auditory feedback to users, thus compromising their safety or privacy, sowing confusion, or other harmful effects. To defend against these threats, we discuss mitigation strategies and best practices for developers, including an initial defense prototype, and call on the community to develop new protection mechanisms to mitigate these risks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Current safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but they experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment depth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prefilling and refusal direction manipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework that overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically rebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by probabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths during fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against prefilling and refusal direction attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen jailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source LLM families and six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success rates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |

We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs reproduce the biases observed in human decision-making. We adapt a resume-style audit to scientific publishing, developing a multi-role LLM simulation (editor/reviewer) that evaluates a representative set of high-quality manuscripts across the physical, biological, and social sciences under randomized author identities (institutional prestige, gender, race). The audit reveals a strong and consistent institutional-prestige bias: identical papers attributed to low-prestige affiliations face a significantly higher risk of rejection, despite only modest differences in LLM-assessed quality. To probe mechanisms, we generate synthetic CVs for the same author profiles; these encode large prestige-linked disparities and an inverted prestige-tenure gradient relative to national benchmarks. The results suggest that both domain norms and prestige-linked priors embedded in training data shape paper-level outcomes once identity is visible, converting affiliation into a decisive status cue.</p></details> |  |

TextMine integrates document chunking, domain-aware prompting, triple extraction, and both reference-based and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. We also create the first HMA ontology and a curated dataset of real-world demining reports. Experiments show ontology-aligned prompts boost extraction accuracy by 44.2%, cut hallucinations by 22.5%, and improve format conformance by 20.9% over baselines. While validated on Cambodian reports, TextMine can adapt to global demining efforts or other domains, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.</p></details> |  |

LIR-ASR applies a "Listening-Imagining-Refining" strategy, generating phonetic variants and refining them in context. A heuristic optimization with finite state machine (FSM) is introduced to prevent the correction process from being trapped in local optima and rule-based constraints help maintain semantic fidelity. Experiments on both English and Chinese ASR outputs show that LIR-ASR achieves average reductions in CER/WER of up to 1.5 percentage points compared to baselines, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains in transcription.</p></details> |  |

However, there is no consensus on how to tokenize the space following the colon, often overlooked as a trivial choice. In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements. Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise.

From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically. Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such as text comprehension and information extraction (IE). This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of 10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks. This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation) improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts, contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, training proxy judge models using evaluation data generated by powerful teacher models introduces a critical yet previously overlooked issue: teacher preference bias, where the proxy judge model learns a biased preference for responses from the teacher model. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel setting that incorporates an additional assistant model, which is not biased toward the teacher model's responses, to complement the training data. Building on this setup, we introduce AGDe-Judge, a three-stage framework designed to debias from both the labels and feedbacks in the training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGDe-Judge effectively reduces teacher preference bias while maintaining strong performance across six evaluation benchmarks.

Increasingly, these dialogues are synthetically generated by using powerful large language models (LLMs), especially in domains where obtaining authentic human data is challenging. One such domain is human resources (HR). In this context, we compare two LLM-based dialogue generation methods for producing HR job interviews, and assess which method generates higher-quality dialogues, i.e., those more difficult to distinguish from genuine human discourse. The first method uses a single prompt to generate the complete interview dialogue. The second method uses two agents that converse with each other. To evaluate dialogue quality under each method, we ask a judge LLM to determine whether AI was used for interview generation, using pairwise interview comparisons. We empirically find that, at the expense of a sixfold increase in token count, interviews generated with the dual-prompt method achieve a win rate 2 to 10 times higher than those generated with the single-prompt method. This difference remains consistent regardless of whether GPT-4o or Llama 3.3 70B is used for either interview generation or quality judging.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

Drawing on the Argumentative Theory of Reasoning, we argue that confirmation bias, often seen as detrimental, can be harnessed as a resource when paired with critical evaluation. We propose a three-step process in which individuals first generate ideas independently, then use LLMs to refine and articulate them, and finally engage with LLMs as epistemic provocateurs to anticipate group critique. This framing positions LLMs as tools for scaffolding disagreement, helping individuals prepare for more productive group discussions.</p></details> |  |

Although previous studies have utilized large language models (LLMs) to simulate interactive dynamic learning environments for students, these interactions remain limited to conversational exchanges, lacking insights and adaptations to the learners' individualized learning and cognitive states. As a result, students' interest in discussions with AI learning companions is low, and they struggle to gain inspiration from such interactions. To address this challenge, we propose OnlineMate, a multi-agent learning companion system driven by LLMs that integrates the Theory of Mind (ToM). OnlineMate is capable of simulating peer-like agent roles, adapting to learners' cognitive states during collaborative discussions, and inferring their psychological states, such as misunderstandings, confusion, or motivation. By incorporating Theory of Mind capabilities, the system can dynamically adjust its interaction strategies to support the development of higher-order thinking and cognition. Experimental results in simulated learning scenarios demonstrate that OnlineMate effectively fosters deep learning and discussions while enhancing cognitive engagement in online educational settings.</p></details> |  |

A key operation is substructure search, which identifies all JSON objects containing a query pattern. This task underpins applications such as drug discovery (querying compounds for functional groups), prompt engineering (extracting prompts with schema fragments), and geospatial analytics (finding entities with nested attributes). However, existing methods are inefficient: traversal requires exhaustive tree matching, succinct JSON representations save space but do not accelerate search, and XML-based approaches incur conversion overhead and semantic mismatches. We present jXBW, a compressed index for efficient substructure search over JSONL. jXBW introduces three innovations: (i) a merged tree representation that consolidates repeated structures, (ii) a succinct tree index based on the eXtended Burrows--Wheeler Transform (XBW), and (iii) a three-phase algorithm for substructure search. These enable query-dependent complexity, where cost depends on query characteristics rather than dataset size, while retaining succinct space. This resolves a key bottleneck in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems requiring structure-aware retrieval. Experiments on seven real datasets, including PubChem (1M compounds) and OSM geospatial data (6.6M objects), achieve up to 4,700$\times$ speedup over tree-based methods and over $6\times 10^6$ speedup relative to XML-based approaches. jXBW makes JSONL substructure search practical for the first time, opening opportunities for large-scale LLM-based analytics.</p></details> |  |

While Masader (Alyafeai et al.,2021) laid the groundwork for extracting a wide range of metadata attributes from Arabic NLP datasets' scholarly articles, it relies heavily on manual annotation. In this paper, we present MOLE, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata attributes from scientific papers covering datasets of languages other than Arabic. Our schema-driven methodology processes entire documents across multiple input formats and incorporates robust validation mechanisms for consistent output. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the research progress on this task. Through systematic analysis of context length, few-shot learning, and web browsing integration, we demonstrate that modern LLMs show promising results in automating this task, highlighting the need for further future work improvements to ensure consistent and reliable performance.

To prevent improper responses, safety mechanisms, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are implemented in them. In this work, we bypass these safety measures for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek by making them impersonate complex personas with personality characteristics that are not aligned with a truthful assistant. First, we create elaborate biographies of these personas, which we then use in a new session with the same chatbots. Our conversations then follow a role-play style to elicit prohibited responses. Using personas, we show that prohibited responses are provided, making it possible to obtain unauthorized, illegal, or harmful information when querying ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek. We show that these chatbots are vulnerable to this attack by getting dangerous information for 40 out of 40 illicit questions in GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-1.5-flash, 39 out of 40 in GPT-4o-mini, 38 out of 40 in GPT-3.5-turbo, and 2 out of 2 cases in Gemini-2.5-flash and DeepSeek V3.

We present Nazonazo, a cost-effective and extensible benchmark built from Japanese children's riddles to test insight-based reasoning. Items are short (mostly one sentence), require no specialized domain knowledge, and can be generated at scale, enabling rapid refresh of blind sets when leakage is suspected. We evaluate 38 frontier models and 126 adults on 120 riddles. No model except for GPT-5 is comparable to human performance, which achieves a 52.9% mean accuracy. Model comparison on extended 201 items shows that reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning peers, while model size shows no reliable association with accuracy. Beyond aggregate accuracy, an informal candidate-tracking analysis of thought logs reveals many cases of verification failure: models often produce the correct solution among intermediate candidates yet fail to select it as the final answer, which we illustrate with representative examples observed in multiple models. Nazonazo thus offers a cost-effective, scalable, and easily renewable benchmark format that addresses the current evaluation crisis while also suggesting a recurrent meta-cognitive weakness, providing clear targets for future control and calibration methods.</p></details> |  |

However, it suffers from a coordination and scalability bottleneck as the number of agents increases. To address these issues, we propose the LLM-empowered expert demonstrations framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (LEED). LEED consists of two components: a demonstration generation (DG) module and a policy optimization (PO) module. Specifically, the DG module leverages large language models to generate instructions for interacting with the environment, thereby producing high-quality demonstrations. The PO module adopts a decentralized training paradigm, where each agent utilizes the generated demonstrations to construct an expert policy loss, which is then integrated with its own policy loss. This enables each agent to effectively personalize and optimize its local policy based on both expert knowledge and individual experience. Experimental results show that LEED achieves superior sample efficiency, time efficiency, and robust scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing assertion generation methods primarily rely on information either from the design specification, or register-transfer level (RTL) code. The former methods are typically limited to generating assertions for the top-level design. As the top-level design is composed of different modules without module-level specifications, they are unable to generate deep assertions that target the internal functionality of modules. The latter methods often rely on a golden RTL model, which is difficult to obtain. To address the above limitations, this paper presents a novel large language model (LLM)-aided verification framework named DeepAssert. DeepAssert is capable of analyzing the invocation relationships between modules and extracting independent specifications for each module with its I/O port information. These extracted specifications are subsequently used to guide LLMs to automatically generate fine-grained deep assertions for these modules. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepAssert significantly outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality deep assertions for modules. Furthermore, when integrated with these methods, DeepAssert can enhance the overall quality of the assertions generated. This allows for a more comprehensive and effective verification process.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

To address these limitations, we propose a ``Reveal-and-Release'' method to unlearn with self-generated data, where we prompt the model to reveal what it knows using optimized instructions. To fully utilize the self-generated forget data, we propose an iterative unlearning framework, where we make incremental adjustments to the model's weight space with parameter-efficient modules trained on the forget data.

This arises when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors misaligned with the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HITL) methods can mitigate this issue, they also introduce biases, leading to inconsistent and subjective feedback that complicates learning. To address these challenges, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. Using LLMs as direct feedback providers eliminates the need for surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often inherit biases from training data. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human feedback. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with Average Episodic Reward dropping by nearly 94% compared to unbiased approaches. In contrast, LLM-based methods sustain performance at a similar level to unbiased feedback, even in challenging edge-case scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

A widely held "cascading failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought (ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware correction mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

While previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized, adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned human-AI interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 MainConference</p></details> |

Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

Personal style is often subtle and implicit, making it difficult to specify through prompts yet essential for user-aligned generation. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' ability to mimic personal writing styles via in-context learning from a small number of user-authored samples. We introduce an ensemble of complementary metrics-including authorship attribution, authorship verification, style matching, and AI detection-to robustly assess style imitation. Our evaluation spans over 40000 generations per model across domains such as news, email, forums, and blogs, covering writing samples from more than 400 real-world authors. Results show that while LLMs can approximate user styles in structured formats like news and email, they struggle with nuanced, informal writing in blogs and forums. Further analysis on various prompting strategies such as number of demonstrations reveal key limitations in effective personalization. Our findings highlight a fundamental gap in personalized LLM adaptation and the need for improved techniques to support implicit, style-consistent generation.

However, these methods overlook the model's inherent knowledge distribution, introducing noise, redundancy, and irrelevant data, leading to a mismatch between the selected data and the model's learning task, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage model-centric data selection framework, Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection (3DS), which aligns data with the model's knowledge distribution for optimized adaptation. In Stage1, we apply Prompt-Driven Data Selection via Explicit Alignment, where the the model filters irrelevant or redundant data based on its internal knowledge. In Stage2, we perform Decomposed Difficulty Data Selection, where data selection is guided by our defined difficulty decomposition, using three metrics: Instruction Understanding, Response Confidence, and Response Correctness. Additionally, an attention-based importance weighting mechanism captures token importance for more accurate difficulty calibration. This two-stage approach ensures the selected data is not only aligned with the model's knowledge and preferences but also appropriately challenging for the model to learn, leading to more effective and targeted domain adaptation. In the case study of the medical domain, our extensive experiments on real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3DS over exisiting methods in accuracy by over 5.29%.

To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding. Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision. Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

While the "personification" enhances human experiences of interactivity and adaptability of LLMs, it gives rise to critical concerns about content safety, particularly regarding bias, sentiment and toxicity of LLM generation. This study explores how assigning different personality traits to LLMs affects the toxicity and biases of their outputs. Leveraging the widely accepted HEXACO personality framework developed in social psychology, we design experimentally sound prompts to test three LLMs' performance on three toxic and bias benchmarks. The findings demonstrate the sensitivity of all three models to HEXACO personality traits and, more importantly, a consistent variation in the biases, negative sentiment and toxicity of their output. In particular, adjusting the levels of several personality traits can effectively reduce bias and toxicity in model performance, similar to humans' correlations between personality traits and toxic behaviors. The findings highlight the additional need to examine content safety besides the efficiency of training or fine-tuning methods for LLM personification. They also suggest a potential for the adjustment of personalities to be a simple and low-cost method to conduct controlled text generation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a systematic investigation into these comprehension failures. Our work yields three key insights: (1) the step-by-step principle, effective for calculation, can be migrated to the reading process to enhance comprehension; (2) increasing the proportion of question-related tokens (e.g., via repetition) succeeds by refocusing attention, a mechanism that can be explicitly controlled; and (3) backward dependencies represent a core bottleneck for decoder-only models that persists even with strong methods like Chain-of-Thought. Based on these findings, we introduce the Step-by-Step Reading (SSR) family of prompts. This multi-stage approach culminates in SSR++, a method specifically engineered to deepen model comprehension by guiding it to parse questions with finer granularity, focus attention on critical tokens, and resolve backward dependencies through iterative re-contextualization. SSR++ sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple reasoning benchmarks, and our analysis confirms it works by directly mitigating semantic misunderstanding. These results demonstrate that guiding how a model reads is a powerful and efficient method for improving its reasoning ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Done ...</summary><p>Done in November 2024</p></details> |

Our paper fills this significant gap by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile estimation that not only can produce estimates, but also can coordinate, communicate and discuss with human developers and other agents to reach a consensus. Evaluation results on a real-life dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across all evaluation metrics in the majority of the cases. Our human study with software development practitioners also demonstrates an overwhelmingly positive experience in collaborating with our agents in agile effort estimation.</p></details> | Submitted to ASE'25 |
| **[Estimating Semantic Alphabet Size for LLM Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14478v1)** | 2025-09-17 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.14478v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many black-box techniques for quantifying the uncertainty of large language models (LLMs) rely on repeated LLM sampling, which can be computationally expensive. Therefore, practical applicability demands reliable estimation from few samples. Semantic entropy (SE) is a popular sample-based uncertainty estimator with a discrete formulation attractive for the black-box setting. Recent extensions of semantic entropy exhibit improved LLM hallucination detection, but do so with less interpretable methods that admit additional hyperparameters. For this reason, we revisit the canonical discrete semantic entropy estimator, finding that it underestimates the "true" semantic entropy, as expected from theory. We propose a modified semantic alphabet size estimator, and illustrate that using it to adjust discrete semantic entropy for sample coverage results in more accurate semantic entropy estimation in our setting of interest. Furthermore, our proposed alphabet size estimator flags incorrect LLM responses as well or better than recent top-performing approaches, with the added benefit of remaining highly interpretable.</p></details> |  |

With the recent rise of generative large language models (LLMs), there has been a corresponding rise in the number of papers that apply LLMs to de-identification. Although these approaches often report near-perfect results, significant challenges concerning reproducibility and utility of the research papers persist. This paper identifies three key limitations in the current literature: inconsistent reporting metrics hindering direct comparisons, the inadequacy of traditional classification metrics in capturing errors which LLMs may be more prone to (i.e., altering clinically relevant information), and lack of manual validation of automated metrics which aim to quantify these errors. To address these issues, we first present a survey of LLM-based de-identification research, highlighting the heterogeneity in reporting standards. Second, we evaluated a diverse set of models to quantify the extent of inappropriate removal of clinical information. Next, we conduct a manual validation of an existing evaluation metric to measure the removal of clinical information, employing clinical experts to assess their efficacy. We highlight poor performance and describe the inherent limitations of such metrics in identifying clinically significant changes. Lastly, we propose a novel methodology for the detection of clinically relevant information removal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.</p></details> |  |

But humans have access to a broad and embodied context, which is key in detecting and resolving linguistic ambiguities, even in isolated text spans. A foundational case of semantic ambiguity is found in the task of coreference resolution: how is a pronoun related to an earlier person mention? This capability is implicit in nearly every downstream task, and the presence of ambiguity at this level can alter performance significantly. We show that LLMs can achieve good performance with minimal prompting in both coreference disambiguation and the detection of ambiguity in coreference, however, they cannot do both at the same time. We present the CORRECT-DETECT trade-off: though models have both capabilities and deploy them implicitly, successful performance balancing these two abilities remains elusive.</p></details> |  |

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</p></details> | <details><summary>Selec...</summary><p>Selected at NeurIPS'25 (poster)</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Free Adversarial Purification with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13336v2)** | 2025-09-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13336v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial training and adversarial purification are two widely used defense strategies for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial training requires costly retraining, while adversarial purification often suffers from low efficiency. More critically, existing defenses are primarily designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against recently introduced unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient defense framework that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our approach is motivated by the observation that adversarial examples typically lie near the decision boundary and are highly sensitive to pixel-level perturbations. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing, a preprocessing technique that mitigates adversarial noise by reducing the magnitude of pixel-level perturbations. In addition, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly restore high-quality images from adversarially degraded ones. Unlike image synthesis methods that generate entirely new images, adversarial super-resolution focuses on image restoration, making it more suitable for purification. Importantly, both techniques require no additional training and are computationally efficient since they do not rely on gradient computations. To further improve robustness across diverse datasets, we introduce a contrastive learning-based adversarial deblurring fine-tuning method. By incorporating adversarial priors during fine-tuning on the target dataset, this method enhances purification effectiveness without the need to retrain diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension. Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

RAM++ integrates high-level semantic understanding with low-level texture generation to achieve content-oriented robust restoration. It addresses the limitations of existing degradation-oriented methods in extreme scenarios (e.g., degradations strongly coupled with image structures). RAM++ also mitigates common challenges such as unbalanced performance across tasks, overfitting to seen degradations, and weak generalization to unseen ones through three key designs: 1) Adaptive Semantic-Aware Mask (AdaSAM): a pretraining strategy that applies pixel-level masks to semantically rich and textured regions. This design enables the network to learn both generative priors and image content priors from various degradations. 2) Mask Attribute Conductance (MAC): a selective fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the layers with higher contributions to bridge the integrity gap between masked pretraining and full-image fine-tuning while retaining learned priors. 3) Robust Feature Regularization (RFR): a strategy that leverages DINOv2's semantically consistent and degradation-invariant representations, together with efficient feature fusion, to achieve faithful and semantically coherent restoration. With these designs, RAM++ achieves robust, well-balanced, and state-of-the-art performance across seen, unseen, extreme, and mixed degradations. Our code and model will be released at https://github.com/DragonisCV/RAM</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

However, these datasets often differ significantly in resolution, style, and domain characteristics, leading to substantial domain gaps that hinder the development and fair evaluation of unified models. Furthermore, the lack of a large-scale, real-world all-in-one weather restoration dataset remains a critical bottleneck in advancing this field. To address these limitations, we present a real-world all-in-one adverse weather image restoration benchmark dataset, which contains image pairs captured under various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and haze, as well as diverse outdoor scenes and illumination settings. The resulting dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of task-specific, task-general, and all-in-one restoration methods on our dataset. Our dataset offers a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical all-in-one image restoration in real-world scenarios.

Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints. To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints.

Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics.

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09388v2)** | 2025-08-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2308.09388v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques.

While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.</p></details> |  |

However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion. Experiments on shadow removal tasks demonstrate that these methods can effectively improve image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to make major changes and re-upload</p></details> |

Although some methods combining traditional optimization algorithms with DNNs have been proposed, they all have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a three-granularity memory layer and contrast learning named MemoryNet, specifically, dividing the samples into positive, negative, and actual three samples for contrastive learning, where the memory layer is able to preserve the deep features of the image and the contrastive learning converges the learned features to balance. Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

The early face restoration methods mainly use statistical priors and degradation models, which are difficult to meet the requirements of real-world applications in practice. In recent years, face restoration has witnessed great progress after stepping into the deep learning era. However, there are few works to systematically study the deep learning based face restoration methods. Thus, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in deep learning techniques for face restoration. Specifically, we first summarize different problem formulations and analyze the characteristics of face images. Second, we discuss the challenges of face restoration. With regard to these challenges, we present a comprehensive review of recent FR methods, including prior-based methods and deep-learning methods. Then, we explore developed techniques in the task of FR covering network architectures, loss functions, and benchmark datasets. We also conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation on representative methods. Finally, we discuss the future directions including network designs, metrics, benchmark datasets, applications, etc. We also provide an open source repository for all the discussed methods, which is available at https://github.com/TaoWangzj/Awesome-Face-Restoration.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |

However, most existing methods are obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score. Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image restoration tasks.

Despite great advances in image restoration and enhancement in recent years, such systematic defects often cannot be restored by current state-of-the-art software features as available e.g. in Adobe Photoshop, but would require the incorporation of defect-aware priors into the underlying machine learning techniques. However, there are no publicly available datasets of autochromes with defect annotations. In this paper, we address these limitations and present the first approach that allows the automatic removal of greening color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. For this purpose, we introduce an approach for accurately simulating respective defects and use the respectively obtained synthesized data with its ground truth defect annotations to train a generative AI model with a carefully designed loss function that accounts for color imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our approach allows for the efficient and effective restoration of the considered defects, thereby overcoming limitations of alternative techniques that struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require significant manual effort.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing, integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions, and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in restored image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready, update Fig.4</p></details> |

However, license plate areas in dash cam images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework, MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR (RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments, MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms significantly contribute to these improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Computer Vision and Image Understanding (CVIU), 2025</p></details> |

This study presents the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs), including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models, particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training, inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment. This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.</p></details> |  |

Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Underwater monitoring platforms rely on mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, current explainable IQA methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding, detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework. This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing GPT-4o.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM) module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation. Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be available after the article is accepted.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; https://github.com/cszn/ConverseNet</p></details> |

Current image restoration methods struggle to handle complex degradation while maintaining efficiency. This paper introduces a novel image restoration architecture that combines multi-dimensional dynamic attention and self-attention within a U-Net framework. To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  |

This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  |

The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

However, existing methods often rely on implicitly learned priors, which may entangle feature representations and hinder performance in complex or unseen scenarios. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has strong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a powerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose HOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for degradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware Self-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial dependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG descriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates channel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under diverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance structural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight.

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

However, they face several critical challenges: removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle Similarity: A Perceptually-guided Cross-Reference Metric for Artifact Detection in 3D Scene Reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17489v3)** | 2025-07-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.17489v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern reconstruction techniques can effectively model complex 3D scenes from sparse 2D views. However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.</p></details> |  |

Especially Transformer-based models, particularly those leveraging window-based self-attention, have become a dominant force in image restoration. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by the rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to two critical limitations: insufficient feature interaction across window boundaries and content-agnostic receptive fields that cannot adapt to diverse image structures. Existing methods often rely on heuristic patterns to mitigate these issues, rather than addressing the root cause. In this paper, we propose the Deformable Sliding Window Transformer (DSwinIR), a new foundational backbone architecture that systematically overcomes these limitations. At the heart of DSwinIR is the proposed novel Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention. This mechanism introduces two fundamental innovations. First, it replaces the rigid partitioning with a token-centric sliding window paradigm, ensuring seamless cross-window information flow and effectively eliminating boundary artifacts. Second, it incorporates a content-aware deformable sampling strategy, which allows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and dynamically shape its receptive fields to focus on the most informative image regions. This synthesis endows the model with both strong locality-aware inductive biases and powerful, adaptive long-range modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments show that DSwinIR sets a new state-of-the-art across a wide spectrum of image restoration tasks. For instance, in all-in-one restoration, our DSwinIR surpasses the most recent backbone GridFormer by over 0.53 dB on the three-task benchmark and a remarkable 0.86 dB on the five-task benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks, DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3figures, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.</p></details> |  |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods focus on any one particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3) a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Under Review |

Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance, and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models. Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration, primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.</p></details> |  |

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain, effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.

When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\) and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |

Image restoration has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet). Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.</p></details> |  |

To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution.

Although unsupervised part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors. By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover, several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios.

Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality.

Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB.

| **[Towards a Universal Image Degradation Model via Content-Degradation Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12860v2)** | 2025-07-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.12860v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects. Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code is released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-HSIR: A Multi-Prompt Framework for Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09131v2)** | 2025-07-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.09131v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) often suffer from diverse and unknown degradations during imaging, leading to severe spectral and spatial distortions. Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |

Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions: fixed discussion, corrected spelling</p></details> |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our refractive module simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free (incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance using three image restoration models.

These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios. Moreover, PAG significantly improves the baseline performance in various downstream tasks where existing guidances such as CG or CFG cannot be fully utilized, including ControlNet with empty prompts and image restoration such as inpainting and deblurring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://ku-cvlab.github.io/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance.

Building upon these achievements, diffusion models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning, these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM), a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, and compressed sensing. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively accelerate existing methods while maintaining original performance.</p></details> |  |

While T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors. Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some parts of the thesis require further improvement</p></details> |

However, the degenerate PPP method exhibits weak convergence in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and lacks accelerated variants. To address these issues, we propose a Halpern-type PPP (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence and acceleration properties of Halpern's iteration method. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for image restoration by combining HPPP with denoiser priors such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) prior, which can be viewed as an accelerated PnP method.

However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

Our model generates realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments. Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs, facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad (RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks. Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD = 0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV research.

This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.</p></details> |  |

Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.</p></details> |  |

PRISM offers a technical advancement over current methods by incorporating a powerful measurement-conditioned diffusion model into a theoretically principled posterior sampling scheme. Experiments on blind image deblurring validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superior performance of PRISM over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and blur kernel recovery.</p></details> |  |

Our approach addresses two major challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective self-supervised solution for real-world denoising.

Current diffusion models can address the problem of correcting the timing of imprecisely timed poses, but we find that no good solution exists for leveraging the diffusion prior to enhance a sparse set of blocking poses with additional pose detail. We overcome this challenge using a simple inference-time trick. At certain diffusion steps, we blend the outputs of an unconditioned diffusion model with input blocking pose constraints using per-blocking-pose tolerance weights, and pass this result in as the input condition to an pre-existing motion retiming model. We find this approach works significantly better than existing approaches that attempt to add detail by blending model outputs or via expressing blocking pose constraints as guidance. The result is the first diffusion model that can robustly convert blocking-level poses into plausible detailed character animations.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

Existing generative audio models are largely limited to mono or stereo formats and cannot capture the full 3D localization cues available in first-order Ambisonics (FOA). Recent FOA models extend text-to-audio generation but remain restricted to static sources. In this work, we introduce SonicMotion, the first end-to-end latent diffusion framework capable of generating FOA audio with explicit control over moving sound sources. SonicMotion is implemented in two variations: 1) a descriptive model conditioned on natural language prompts, and 2) a parametric model conditioned on both text and spatial trajectory parameters for higher precision. To support training and evaluation, we construct a new dataset of over one million simulated FOA caption pairs that include both static and dynamic sources with annotated azimuth, elevation, and motion attributes. Experiments show that SonicMotion achieves state-of-the-art semantic alignment and perceptual quality comparable to leading text-to-audio systems, while uniquely attaining low spatial localization error.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods often rely on regression, feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation. The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates. These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance across a variety of real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |

In its basic version, it only requires knowledge of the gradient of the log-density, also called the score function. However, in deep learning, it is often easier to learn the so-called "noisy-data score function", i.e. the gradient of the log-density of noisy data, more precisely when Gaussian noise is added to the data. Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the Langevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin algorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding first-order terms. Unlike diffusion models, our algorithm only needs to know the noisy score function for one single noise level. We further propose a simple special case which has an interesting intuitive interpretation of iteratively adding noise the data and then attempting to remove half of that noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version published at TMLR</p></details> |

Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DAGM GCPR 2025</p></details> |

Prior methods combining autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts, which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine, jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule (PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity (scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and multi-objective molecular generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark. Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.</p></details> |  |

Among these, egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception - enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication, under review</p></details> |

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10$\times$ acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, list commonly-used modeling methods, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training, inference, quantization. We also discuss the trustworthy issues and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains and etc.. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Relative papers are collected in https://github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-Discrete-Diffusion-LLM_MLLM</p></details> |  |

In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks.</p></details> |  |

In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the "purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging generative models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques with a lower GPU memory consumption.

We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Diffusion model, phase retrieval, inline-holography, inverse problem</p></details> |

However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments.

Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.</p></details> |  |

Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations. We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 page.

To address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity. These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.</p></details> |  |

However, we observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior. While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models (LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning, allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions, without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.</p></details> |  |

Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model} and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}. Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, most multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, while their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early to reduce the likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and model-centric approaches. We also emphasise deeper integration across multiple levels of multimodality and multidisciplinary collaboration to significantly broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response, self-driving car design, and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability, and finance. By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal impact.</p></details> |  |

SEE&TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP> tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the <ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The growing population of L2 English speakers has intensified the demand for reliable SLA, a critical component of Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL). Existing efforts often rely on cascaded pipelines, which are prone to error propagation, or end-to-end models that often operate on a short audio window, which might miss discourse-level evidence. This paper introduces a novel multimodal foundation model approach that performs session-level evaluation in a single pass. Our approach couples multi-target learning with a frozen, Whisper ASR model-based speech prior for acoustic-aware calibration, allowing for jointly learning holistic and trait-level objectives of SLA without resorting to handcrafted features. By coherently processing the entire response session of an L2 speaker, the model excels at predicting holistic oral proficiency.

| **[DistillMatch: Leveraging Knowledge Distillation from Vision Foundation Model for Multimodal Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16017v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.16017v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis. However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets, existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities, including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations. Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation. Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions.

| **[Optimizing Product Deduplication in E-Commerce with Multimodal Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15858v1)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15858v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the platform and increasing costs. Traditional keyword-based search methodologies falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss. Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding 200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of 0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, existing benchmarks often lack fine-grained subject coverage, neglect the step-by-step reasoning process, and are predominantly English-centric, failing to systematically evaluate the role of visual information. Therefore, we introduce \textbf {Multi-Physics} for Chinese physics reasoning, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 5 difficulty levels, featuring 1,412 image-associated, multiple-choice questions spanning 11 high-school physics subjects. We employ a dual evaluation framework to evaluate 20 different MLLMs, analyzing both final answer accuracy and the step-by-step integrity of their chain-of-thought. Furthermore, we systematically study the impact of difficulty level and visual information by comparing the model performance before and after changing the input mode. Our work provides not only a fine-grained resource for the community but also offers a robust methodology for dissecting the multimodal reasoning process of state-of-the-art MLLMs, and our dataset and code have been open-sourced: https://github.com/luozhongze/Multi-Physics.</p></details> |  |

However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Upon ...</summary><p>Upon further review, we identified that our dataset requires optimization to ensure research reliability and accuracy.

In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 48pages |

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) present new opportunities for APA, but their effectiveness in fine-grained assessment remains uncertain. This work investigates fine-tuning LMMs for APA using the Speechocean762 dataset and a private corpus. Fine-tuning significantly outperforms zero-shot settings and achieves competitive results on single-granularity tasks compared to public and commercial systems. The model performs well at word and sentence levels, while phoneme-level assessment remains challenging. We also observe that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) reaches 0.9, whereas Spearman's rank Correlation Coefficient (SCC) remains around 0.6, suggesting that SCC better reflects ordinal consistency. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LMMs for APA and point to future work on fine-grained modeling and rank-aware evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |

Unlike autoregressive (AR) models, dLLMs and dMLLMs adopt a multi-token, parallel decoding paradigm using full attention and a denoising-based generation strategy. This paradigm naturally enables parallel generation, fine-grained output control, and dynamic perception. These capabilities are previously difficult to achieve with AR models. A growing number of industrial-scale proprietary d(M)LLMs, as well as a large number of open-source academic d(M)LLMs, have demonstrated performance comparable to their autoregressive counterparts, while achieving up to 10$\times$ acceleration in inference speed. These developments position discrete diffusion models as a promising alternative to intelligence based on the traditional autoregressive approach. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the research in the dLLM and dMLLM domains. We trace the historical development of dLLMs and dMLLMs, formalize the underlying mathematical frameworks, list commonly-used modeling methods, and categorize representative models. We further analyze key techniques for training, inference, quantization. We also discuss the trustworthy issues and summarize emerging applications across language, vision-language, and biological domains and etc.. We conclude by discussing future directions for research and deployment. Relative papers are collected in https://github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-Discrete-Diffusion-LLM_MLLM</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models. Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of large language models and vision-language models in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation, which reduces early-stage query ambiguity by warm-starting the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, and hindsight trajectory augmentation, which enables counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This need arises from the widespread influence and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV (VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in combating misinformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Change Detection of Roads and Bridges: A Fine-grained Dataset and Multimodal Frequency-driven Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13212v3)** | 2025-09-19 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.13212v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection of road and bridge changes is crucial for urban planning and transportation management, yet presents unique challenges for general change detection (CD). Key difficulties arise from maintaining the continuity of roads and bridges as linear structures and disambiguating visually similar land covers (e.g., road construction vs. bare land). Existing spatial-domain models struggle with these issues, further hindered by the lack of specialized, semantically rich datasets. To fill these gaps, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset. As the first benchmark to systematically target semantic change detection of roads and bridges, RB-SCD offers comprehensive fine-grained annotations for 11 semantic change categories. This enables a detailed analysis of traffic infrastructure evolution. Building on this, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). MFDCD integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain through two key components: (1) the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC), which leverages wavelet transform to decompose visual features, enabling it to robustly model the continuity of linear transitions; and (2) the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF), which encodes semantic priors into frequency-domain graphs and applies filter banks to align them with visual features, resolving semantic ambiguities. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MFDCD on RB-SCD and three public CD datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/DaGuangDaGuang/RB-SCD.</p></details> |  |

Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the harmlessness of four leading MLLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus) when exposed to adversarial prompts across text-only and multimodal formats. A team of 26 red teamers generated 726 prompts targeting three harm categories: illegal activity, disinformation, and unethical behaviour. These prompts were submitted to each model, and 17 annotators rated 2,904 model outputs for harmfulness using a 5-point scale. Results show significant differences in vulnerability across models and modalities. Pixtral 12B exhibited the highest rate of harmful responses (~62%), while Claude Sonnet 3.5 was the most resistant (~10%). Contrary to expectations, text-only prompts were slightly more effective at bypassing safety mechanisms than multimodal ones. Statistical analysis confirmed that both model type and input modality were significant predictors of harmfulness. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust, multimodal safety benchmarks as MLLMs are deployed more widely.</p></details> |  |

While prior work has primarily focused on textual or visual-textual sarcasm, comprehensive audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs for sarcasm detection on English (MUStARD++) and Chinese (MCSD 1.0) in zero-shot, few-shot, and LoRA fine-tuning settings. In addition to direct classification, we explore models as feature encoders, integrating their representations through a collaborative gating fusion module. Experimental results show that audio-based models achieve the strongest unimodal performance, while text-audio and audio-vision combinations outperform unimodal and trimodal models. Furthermore, MLLMs such as Qwen-Omni show competitive zero-shot and fine-tuned performance. Our findings highlight the potential of MLLMs for cross-lingual, audio-visual-textual sarcasm understanding.</p></details> |  |

With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> |  |

We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC), but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC). We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA may underperform.

A Comparative Study of Multimodal, Caption-Based, and Hybrid Retrieval Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15211v1)** | 2025-09-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15211v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slide decks, serving as digital reports that bridge the gap between presentation slides and written documents, are a prevalent medium for conveying information in both academic and corporate settings. Their multimodal nature, combining text, images, and charts, presents challenges for retrieval-augmented generation systems, where the quality of retrieval directly impacts downstream performance. Traditional approaches to slide retrieval often involve separate indexing of modalities, which can increase complexity and lose contextual information. This paper investigates various methodologies for effective slide retrieval, including visual late-interaction embedding models like ColPali, the use of visual rerankers, and hybrid retrieval techniques that combine dense retrieval with BM25, further enhanced by textual rerankers and fusion methods like Reciprocal Rank Fusion. A novel Vision-Language Models-based captioning pipeline is also evaluated, demonstrating significantly reduced embedding storage requirements compared to visual late-interaction techniques, alongside comparable retrieval performance. Our analysis extends to the practical aspects of these methods, evaluating their runtime performance and storage demands alongside retrieval efficacy, thus offering practical guidance for the selection and development of efficient and robust slide retrieval systems for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178v1)** | 2025-09-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.15178v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.</p></details> |  |

Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical artificial intelligence (AI) models are trained on highly prevalent data patterns, which reinforces biases and fails to capture the breadth of clinical expertise. Inspired by the recent advances in Mixture of Experts (MoE), we propose a Mixture of Multicenter Experts (MoME) framework to address AI bias in the medical domain without requiring data sharing across institutions. MoME integrates specialized expertise from diverse clinical strategies to enhance model generalizability and adaptability across medical centers. We validate this framework using a multimodal target volume delineation model for prostate cancer radiotherapy. With few-shot training that combines imaging and clinical notes from each center, the model outperformed baselines, particularly in settings with high inter-center variability or limited data availability. Furthermore, MoME enables model customization to local clinical preferences without cross-institutional data exchange, making it especially suitable for resource-constrained settings while promoting broadly generalizable medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, 1 supplementary material</p></details> |

Although combining audio and visual signals improves recognition, it is still difficult to align them over time and to reduce the effect of noise across modalities. Existing methods often treat audio and visual streams separately, fusing features later with contrastive or mutual information objectives. Recent advances explore multimodal graph learning, but most fail to distinguish between intra- and inter-modal temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose Temporally Heterogeneous Graph-based Contrastive Learning (THGCL). Our framework constructs a temporal graph for each event, where audio and video segments form nodes and their temporal links form edges. We introduce Gaussian processes for intra-modal smoothness, Hawkes processes for inter-modal decay, and contrastive learning to capture fine-grained relationships. Experiments on AudioSet show that THGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

This has motivated the development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level dataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums. Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in missing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre classification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more informative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several multimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across domains. We provide the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/hcai-mms/Music4All-A-A, the dataset is linked in the repository and provided open-source under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 tables, IEEE International Conference on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing (IEEE CBMI)</p></details> |

In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in MLLMs have primarily focused on improving performance through high-quality datasets, novel architectures, and optimized training strategies. However, in this paper, we identify a previously overlooked issue, language prior conflict, a mismatch between the inherent language priors of large language models (LLMs) and the language priors in training datasets. This conflict leads to suboptimal vision-language alignment, as MLLMs are prone to adapting to the language style of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel training method called Decoupled Proxy Alignment (DPA). DPA introduces two key innovations: (1) the use of a proxy LLM during pretraining to decouple the vision-language alignment process from language prior interference, and (2) dynamic loss adjustment based on visual relevance to strengthen optimization signals for visually relevant tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA significantly mitigates the language prior conflict, achieving superior alignment performance across diverse datasets, model families, and scales. Our method not only improves the effectiveness of MLLM training but also shows exceptional generalization capabilities, making it a robust approach for vision-language alignment.

Yet, most creative writing tools remain text-centric, limiting how authors plan and translate ideas. We present Vistoria, a system for synchronized text-image co-editing in fictional story writing that treats visuals and text as coequal narrative materials. A formative Wizard-of-Oz co-design study with 10 story writers revealed how sketches, images, and annotations serve as essential instruments for ideation and organization. Drawing on theories of Instrumental Interaction and Structural Mapping, Vistoria introduces multimodal operations-lasso, collage, filters, and perspective shifts that enable seamless narrative exploration across modalities. A controlled study with 12 participants shows that co-editing enhances expressiveness, immersion, and collaboration, enabling writers to explore divergent directions, embrace serendipitous randomness, and trace evolving storylines. While multimodality increased cognitive demand, participants reported stronger senses of authorship and agency. These findings demonstrate how multimodal co-editing expands creative potential by balancing abstraction and concreteness in narrative development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Change the format of the first page</p></details> |

For instance, speech conveys a vibe or tone not fully captured by text alone. While multimodal LLMs focus on generating text responses from diverse inputs, less attention has been paid to generating natural and engaging speech. We propose a human-like agent that generates speech responses based on conversation mood and responsive style information. To achieve this, we build a novel MultiSensory Conversation dataset focused on speech to enable agents to generate natural speech. We then propose a multimodal LLM-based model for generating text responses and voice descriptions, which are used to generate speech covering paralinguistic information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing both visual and audio modalities in conversation to generate engaging speech.

To solve this issue, we introduce two principal contributions. First, MMED, to our knowledge, is the first dataset capturing the spontaneous vocal cues that co-occur with MEs in ecologically valid, high-stakes interactions. Second, the Asymmetric Multimodal Fusion Network (AMF-Net) is a novel method that effectively fuses a global visual summary with a dynamic audio sequence via an asymmetric cross-attention framework. Rigorous Leave-One-Subject-Out Cross-Validation (LOSO-CV) experiments validate our approach, providing conclusive evidence that audio offers critical, disambiguating information for ME analysis. Collectively, the MMED dataset and our AMF-Net method provide valuable resources and a validated analytical approach for micro-expression recognition.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 24 figures and 10 tables; Update related work and fix typos</p></details> |

However, most prior multimodal approaches assume all modalities are available at inference, leading to significant accuracy drops, or even failure, when inputs are missing. To address this, we introduce KARMMA, a multimodal Knowledge distillation approach for egocentric Action Recognition robust to Missing ModAlities that requires no modality alignment across all samples during training or inference. KARMMA distills knowledge from a multimodal teacher into a multimodal student that benefits from all available modalities while remaining robust to missing ones, making it suitable for diverse multimodal scenarios without retraining. Our student uses approximately 50% fewer computational resources than our teacher, resulting in a lightweight and fast model.

Generating these programs from nonparametric data such as point clouds and meshes remains a crucial yet challenging task, typically requiring extensive manual intervention. Current deep generative models aimed at automating CAD generation are significantly limited by imbalanced and insufficiently large datasets, particularly those lacking representation for complex CAD programs. To address this, we introduce GenCAD-3D, a multimodal generative framework utilizing contrastive learning for aligning latent embeddings between CAD and geometric encoders, combined with latent diffusion models for CAD sequence generation and retrieval. Additionally, we present SynthBal, a synthetic data augmentation strategy specifically designed to balance and expand datasets, notably enhancing representation of complex CAD geometries. Our experiments show that SynthBal significantly boosts reconstruction accuracy, reduces the generation of invalid CAD models, and markedly improves performance on high-complexity geometries, surpassing existing benchmarks.

Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed, multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification, text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead, hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times, with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5 Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over advertising data.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The M-PACE framework uses a "mother-child" AI model system to automate and unify compliance checks for ads, reducing costs while maintaining high accuracy</p></details> |

The model is designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks. For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical translation.

We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents.

Beyond whole-body coordination and balance, a central difficulty lies in understanding human instructions and translating them into coherent sequences of embodied actions. Recent advances in foundation models provide transferable multimodal representations and reasoning capabilities, yet existing efforts remain largely restricted to either locomotion or manipulation in isolation, with limited applicability to humanoid settings. In this paper, we propose Humanoid-COA, the first humanoid agent framework that integrates foundation model reasoning with an Embodied Chain-of-Action (CoA) mechanism for zero-shot loco-manipulation. Within the perception--reasoning--action paradigm, our key contribution lies in the reasoning stage, where the proposed CoA mechanism decomposes high-level human instructions into structured sequences of locomotion and manipulation primitives through affordance analysis, spatial inference, and whole-body action reasoning. Extensive experiments on two humanoid robots, Unitree H1-2 and G1, in both an open test area and an apartment environment, demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms prior baselines across manipulation, locomotion, and loco-manipulation tasks, achieving robust generalization to long-horizon and unstructured scenarios.

This underscores critical limitations in current models' integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor understanding.

This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at CORL 2025.

However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.</p></details> | 13 pages,12 figures |

Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional approaches that process these signals separately or rely on fixed encodings, our technique fuses them into structured image representations that enable CNNs to capture temporal and cross signal dependencies more effectively. This image based transformation not only improves interpretability but also serves as a robust form of data augmentation. To further enhance generalization and model robustness, we systematically reorganize the fused signals into multiple formats, combining them in a multi stage training pipeline. This approach significantly boosts classification performance. While demonstrated here in the context of stress detection, the proposed method is broadly applicable to any domain involving multimodal physiological signals, paving the way for more accurate, personalized, and real time health monitoring through wearable technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages 7 images 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key bottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with binary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents demonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state already matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose State-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive the current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and act accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR can improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\%. Further evaluations on three public benchmarks show that StaR also enhances general task performance. Finally, evaluations on a dynamic environment highlight the potential of StaR for real-world applications.

Exposing the Multimodal-to-Unimodal Bottleneck in Hate Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13608v1)** | 2025-09-17 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.13608v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become integral to daily digital life, understanding their safety architectures is a critical problem for AI Alignment. This paper presents a systematic analysis of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, a globally deployed model, on the difficult task of multimodal hate speech detection. Using the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset, we conduct a multi-phase investigation on 500 samples to probe the model's reasoning and failure modes. Our central finding is the experimental identification of a "Unimodal Bottleneck," an architectural flaw where the model's advanced multimodal reasoning is systematically preempted by context-blind safety filters. A quantitative validation of 144 content policy refusals reveals that these overrides are triggered in equal measure by unimodal visual 50% and textual 50% content. We further demonstrate that this safety system is brittle, blocking not only high-risk imagery but also benign, common meme formats, leading to predictable false positives. These findings expose a fundamental tension between capability and safety in state-of-the-art LMMs, highlighting the need for more integrated, context-aware alignment strategies to ensure AI systems can be deployed both safely and effectively.</p></details> |  |

Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional manual and computer-assisted systems are limited in real-time accessibility and articulatory motion feedback, constraining their practical utility. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly through their ability to integrate multimodal data for adaptive assessment and therapeutic feedback. Nevertheless, challenges including insufficient acquisition and fusion of articulatory information, inadequate parsing of articulatory organ motion trajectories, and the scarcity of high-quality domain-specific datasets hinder the application of MLLMs in speech therapy. To address these limitations, we propose an MLLM-based speech rehabilitation assistance system that synergistically leverages ultrasound tongue imaging and speech signals to deliver precise, interactive articulatory feedback. We construct a high-quality domain-specific dataset comprising UTI-speech dialogue pairs. This dataset facilitates fine-tuning to enhance the model's clinical adaptability. Building on this dataset, our methods achieves spatiotemporal fusion training strategy of ultrasound videos and speech signals, enabling fine-grained articulatory impairment analysis and ultimately generating actionable feedback.</p></details> |  |

ByDeWay uses a novel prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal data is commonly heterogeneous across diverse clients, where each client possesses only a subset of all modalities, renders conventional analysis results and optimization methods in unimodal federated learning inapplicable. In addition, fixed latency demand and limited communication bandwidth pose significant challenges for deploying MFL in wireless scenarios. To optimize the wireless MFL performance on modal heterogeneity, this paper proposes a joint client scheduling and bandwidth allocation (JCSBA) algorithm based on a decision-level fusion architecture with adding a unimodal loss function. Specifically, with the decision results, the unimodal loss functions are added to both the training objective and local update loss functions to accelerate multimodal convergence and improve unimodal performance. To characterize MFL performance, we derive a closed-form upper bound related to client and modality scheduling and minimize the derived bound under the latency, energy, and bandwidth constraints through JCSBA. Experimental results on multimodal datasets demonstrate that the JCSBA algorithm improves the multimodal accuracy and the unimodal accuracy by 4.06% and 2.73%, respectively, compared to conventional algorithms.</p></details> |  |

HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data.

While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together, these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables; appendix 16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A novel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is also designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning process with human safety values.

While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Instead of conventional multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights. Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning.

Diagnosing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques directly from carotid 3D MRI images is relatively challenging for both radiologists and conventional 3D vision networks. In clinical practice, radiologists assess patient conditions using a multimodal approach that incorporates various imaging modalities and domain-specific expertise, paving the way for the creation of multimodal diagnostic networks. In this paper, we have developed an effective strategy to leverage radiologists' domain knowledge to automate the diagnosis of carotid plaque vulnerability through Variation inference and Multimodal knowledge Distillation (VMD). This method excels in harnessing cross-modality prior knowledge from limited image annotations and radiology reports within training data, thereby enhancing the diagnostic network's accuracy for unannotated 3D MRI images. We conducted in-depth experiments on the dataset collected in-house and verified the effectiveness of the VMD strategy we proposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Public Personas: A Multimodal Study of U.S. Legislators' Cross-Platform Social Media Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10720v2)** | 2025-09-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2509.10720v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cross-platform social media analyses primarily focus on the textual features of posts, often lacking multimodal analysis due to past technical limitations. This study addresses this gap by examining how U.S. legislators in the 118th Congress strategically use social media platforms to adapt their public personas by emphasizing different topics and stances. Leveraging the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for fine-grained text and image analysis, we examine 540 legislators personal website and social media, including Facebook, X (Twitter), TikTok. We find that legislators tailor their topics and stances to project distinct public personas on different platforms. Democrats tend to prioritize TikTok, which has a younger user base, while Republicans are more likely to express stronger stances on established platforms such as Facebook and X (Twitter), which offer broader audience reach. Topic analysis reveals alignment with constituents' key concerns, while stances and polarization vary by platform and topic. Large-scale image analysis shows Republicans employing more formal visuals to project authority, whereas Democrats favor campaign-oriented imagery. These findings highlight the potential interplay between platform features, audience demographics, and partisan goals in shaping political communication. By providing insights into multimodal strategies, this study contributes to understanding the role of social media in modern political discourse and communications.</p></details> |  |

However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.</p></details> |  |

We describe how the original SAMU-XLSR method has been updated by selecting a stronger teacher text model and a better initial speech encoder. The source code for training and using SENSE models has been integrated into the SpeechBrain toolkit, and the first SENSE model we trained has been publicly released. We report experimental results on multilingual and multimodal semantic tasks, where our SENSE model achieves highly competitive performance. Finally, this study offers new insights into how semantics are captured in such semantically aligned speech encoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ASRU 2025</p></details> |

Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing MMKGC approaches primarily extend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require creating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and inefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for real-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated competitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their focus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal information. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models with cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their applicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform relevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual sequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the model with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while achieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with minimal hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, enzyme turnover rates remain scarce across most organisms due to the high cost and complexity of experimental measurements. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal framework for predicting the enzyme turnover rate by integrating enzyme sequences, substrate structures, and environmental factors. Our model combines a pre-trained language model and a convolutional neural network to extract features from protein sequences, while a graph neural network captures informative representations from substrate molecules. An attention mechanism is incorporated to enhance interactions between enzyme and substrate representations. Furthermore, we leverage symbolic regression via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to explicitly learn mathematical formulas that govern the enzyme turnover rate, enabling interpretable and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This work provides a robust tool for studying enzyme kinetics and holds promise for applications in enzyme engineering, biotechnology, and industrial biocatalysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL adopts native-resolution Vision Transformers, which enables it to process images at their original variable resolutions. This design avoids the degradation caused by fixed-resolution tiling while preserving fine-grained details and global layouts, which is crucial for visually dense content such as complex charts and diagrams. To ensure the smooth training of MindVL on Ascend NPUs, we develop Mindspeed-MLLM, a distributed multimodal training framework tailored for Ascend NPUs. To maintain training accuracy, we implement equivalent replacements for certain operators. MindVL undergoes a three-phase training process, namely the warm-up phase, multitask training phase, and supervised instruction tuning phase, to gradually enhance its capabilities. This process starts with basic visual and multimodal pre-training, followed by large-scale multiask trainging and instruction tuning. We also adopt multimodal data packaging and hybrid parallelism techniques, which significantly improve end-to-end training speed. To further boost model performance, we specifically introduce test-time resolution search and model weight averaging. Notably, despite using about 1/10 of the training data required by Qwen2.5-VL, MindVL achieves performance on par with Qwen2.5-VL in evaluations of general multimodal understanding and document/table comprehension. Beyond overall scores, MindVL also delivers leading performance in OCR assessments.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we pioneered enhancing MLLMs with spinal keypoint prompting and compiled an AIS knowledge base for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), respectively. Results showed varying effectiveness of visual prompting across different architectures, while RAG substantially improved models' performances on the knowledge assessment task.

However, their predictions may reflect subtle biases influenced by demographic factors such as gender, age, and education. In this work, we propose AesBiasBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs along two complementary dimensions: (1) stereotype bias, quantified by measuring variations in aesthetic evaluations across demographic groups; and (2) alignment between model outputs and genuine human aesthetic preferences. Our benchmark covers three subtasks (Aesthetic Perception, Assessment, Empathy) and introduces structured metrics (IFD, NRD, AAS) to assess both bias and alignment. We evaluate 19 MLLMs, including proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL-2.5, Qwen2.5-VL). Results indicate that smaller models exhibit stronger stereotype biases, whereas larger models align more closely with human preferences. Incorporating identity information often exacerbates bias, particularly in emotional judgments. These findings underscore the importance of identity-aware evaluation frameworks in subjective vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 37 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to extract modality-invariant features when faced with large nonlinear radiometric differences, such as those between SAR and optical images. To address these challenges, we propose OSDM-MReg, a novel multimodal image registration framework that bridges the modality gap through image-to-image translation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step unaligned target-guided conditional diffusion model (UTGOS-CDM) to translate source and target images into a unified representation domain. Unlike traditional conditional DDPM that require hundreds of iterative steps for inference, our model incorporates a novel inverse translation objective during training to enable direct prediction of the translated image in a single step at test time, significantly accelerating the registration process. After translation, we design a multimodal multiscale registration network (MM-Reg) that extracts and fuses both unimodal and translated multimodal images using the proposed multimodal fusion strategy, enhancing the robustness and precision of alignment across scales and modalities. Extensive experiments on the OSdataset demonstrate that OSDM-MReg achieves superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version updates our previous submission.

It has recently attracted surging academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.</p></details> | Updated version |

Recent research has discovered emergent theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). LLMs can reason about people's mental states by solving various text-based ToM tasks that ask questions about the actors' ToM (e.g., human belief, desire, intention). However, human reasoning in the wild is often grounded in dynamic scenes across time. Thus, we consider videos a new medium for examining spatio-temporal ToM reasoning ability. Specifically, we ask explicit probing questions about videos with abundant social and emotional reasoning content. We develop a pipeline for multimodal LLM for ToM reasoning using video and text. We also enable explicit ToM reasoning by retrieving key frames for answering a ToM question, which reveals how multimodal LLMs reason about ToM.</p></details> |  |

A reconstruction objective aligns topic-based representations with the document embedding, encouraging semantic consistency across modalities. Unlike existing approaches, CEMTM can process multiple images per document without repeated encoding and maintains interpretability through explicit word-topic and document-topic distributions. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show that CEMTM consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines, achieving a remarkable average LLM score of 2.61. Further analysis shows its effectiveness in downstream few-shot retrieval and its ability to capture visually grounded semantics in complex domains such as scientific articles.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In current unstructured disassembly scenarios, the dynamic nature of the environment severely limits the robustness of robotic perception, posing a significant barrier to autonomous disassembly in industrial applications. This paper proposes a continual learning framework based on Neuro-Symbolic task and motion planning (TAMP) to enhance the adaptability of embodied intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates a multimodal perception cross-validation mechanism into a bidirectional reasoning flow: the forward working flow dynamically refines and optimizes action strategies, while the backward learning flow autonomously collects effective data from historical task executions to facilitate continual system learning, enabling self-optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the task success rate in dynamic disassembly scenarios from 81.68% to 100%, while reducing the average number of perception misjudgments from 3.389 to 1.128.

However, the high incidence of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality, leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function, which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals.

While traditional continual learning methods focusing on unimodal tasks have achieved notable success, the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models has brought increasing attention to Multimodal Continual Learning tasks involving multiple modalities, such as vision and language. In this setting, models are expected to not only mitigate catastrophic forgetting but also handle the challenges posed by cross-modal interactions and coordination. To facilitate research in this direction, we introduce MCITlib, a comprehensive and constantly evolving code library for continual instruction tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models. In MCITlib, we have currently implemented 8 representative algorithms for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning and systematically evaluated them on 2 carefully selected benchmarks. MCITlib will be continuously updated to reflect advances in the Multimodal Continual Learning field. The codebase is released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/MCITlib.</p></details> | Preprint |

While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |

The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints.

However, current approaches remain limited to textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate. Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players' identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players. To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like social reasoning across multimodal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2025</p></details> |

| **[PhotIQA: A photoacoustic image data set with image quality ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03478v1)** | 2025-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.03478v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |

No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v4)** | 2025-03-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19097v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, as well as in the development stage of machine learning algorithms that operate on medical images. The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20086v1)** | 2025-02-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.20086v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidance-base Diffusion Models for Improving Photoacoustic Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06354v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06354v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873v2)** | 2024-12-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.14873v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.03663v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing.

Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition.

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
