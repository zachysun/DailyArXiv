| **[Innovative LSGTime Model for Crime Spatiotemporal Prediction Based on MindSpore Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20136v3)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.20136v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the acceleration of urbanization, the spatiotemporal characteristics of criminal activities have become increasingly complex. Accurate prediction of crime distribution is crucial for optimizing the allocation of police resources and preventing crime. This paper proposes LGSTime, a crime spatiotemporal prediction model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and the Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism. LSTM and GRU capture long-term dependencies in crime time series, such as seasonality and periodicity, through their unique gating mechanisms. The Multi-head Sparse Self-attention mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on both temporal and spatial features of criminal events simultaneously through parallel processing and sparsification techniques, significantly improving computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. The integrated model leverages the strengths of each technique to better handle complex spatiotemporal data. Experimental findings demonstrate that the model attains optimal performance across four real - world crime datasets. In comparison to the CNN model, it exhibits performance enhancements of 2.8\%, 1.9\%, and 1.4\% in the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics respectively. These results offer a valuable reference for tackling the challenges in crime prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-Dependent Perturbation Effects in Evaluating Time Series Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17022v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.17022v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning models become increasingly prevalent in time series applications, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are essential for understanding their predictions. Within XAI, feature attribution methods aim to identify which input features contribute the most to a model's prediction, with their evaluation typically relying on perturbation-based metrics. Through systematic empirical analysis across multiple datasets, model architectures, and perturbation strategies, we reveal previously overlooked class-dependent effects in these metrics: they show varying effectiveness across classes, achieving strong results for some while remaining less sensitive to others. In particular, we find that the most effective perturbation strategies often demonstrate the most pronounced class differences. Our analysis suggests that these effects arise from the learned biases of classifiers, indicating that perturbation-based evaluation may reflect specific model behaviors rather than intrinsic attribution quality. We propose an evaluation framework with a class-aware penalty term to help assess and account for these effects in evaluating feature attributions, offering particular value for class-imbalanced datasets. Although our analysis focuses on time series classification, these class-dependent effects likely extend to other structured data domains where perturbation-based evaluation is common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI-2025)</p></details> |
| **[SVInvNet: A Densely Connected Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Seismic Velocity Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08194v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2312.08194v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a deep learning-based approach to seismic velocity inversion problem, focusing on both noisy and noiseless training datasets of varying sizes. Our Seismic Velocity Inversion Network (SVInvNet) introduces a novel architecture that contains a multi-connection encoder-decoder structure enhanced with dense blocks. This design is specifically tuned to effectively process time series data, which is essential for addressing the challenges of non-linear seismic velocity inversion. For training and testing, we created diverse seismic velocity models, including multi-layered, faulty, and salt dome categories. We also investigated how different kinds of ambient noise, both coherent and stochastic, and the size of the training dataset affect learning outcomes. SVInvNet is trained on datasets ranging from 750 to 6,000 samples and is tested using a large benchmark dataset of 12,000 samples. Despite its fewer parameters compared to the baseline model, SVInvNet achieves superior performance with this dataset. The performance of SVInvNet was further evaluated using the OpenFWI dataset and Marmousi-derived velocity models. The comparative analysis clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint of the accepted manuscript to appear in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[ResNLS: An Improved Model for Stock Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01020v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2312.01020v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock prices forecasting has always been a challenging task. Although many research projects try to address the problem, few of them pay attention to the varying degrees of dependencies between stock prices. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid model that improves the prediction of stock prices by emphasizing the dependencies between adjacent stock prices. The proposed model, ResNLS, is mainly composed of two neural architectures, ResNet and LSTM. ResNet serves as a feature extractor to identify dependencies between stock prices, while LSTM analyzes the initial time series data with the combination of dependencies, which are considered as residuals. Our experiment reveals that when the closing price data for the previous 5 consecutive trading days is used as input, the performance of the model (ResNLS-5) is optimal compared to those with other inputs. Furthermore, ResNLS-5 demonstrates at least a 20% improvement over current state-of-the-art baselines. To verify whether ResNLS-5 can help clients effectively avoid risks and earn profits in the stock market, we construct a quantitative trading framework for back testing. The result shows that the trading strategy based on ResNLS-5 predictions can successfully mitigate losses during declining stock prices and generate profits in periods of rising stock prices. The relevant code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computational Intelligence 2023</p></details> |
| **[Did ChatGPT or Copilot use alter the style of internet news headlines? A time series regression analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23811v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23811v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that we find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Forecasting via Topological Information Supervised Framework with Efficient Topological Feature Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23757v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23757v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful features from complex data structures, driving significant advancements in fields such as neuroscience, biology, machine learning, and financial modeling. Despite its success, the integration of TDA with time-series prediction remains underexplored due to three primary challenges: the limited utilization of temporal dependencies within topological features, computational bottlenecks associated with persistent homology, and the deterministic nature of TDA pipelines restricting generalized feature learning. This study addresses these challenges by proposing the Topological Information Supervised (TIS) Prediction framework, which leverages neural networks and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to generate synthetic topological features, preserving their distribution while significantly reducing computational time. We propose a novel training strategy that integrates topological consistency loss to improve the predictive accuracy of deep learning models. Specifically, we introduce two state-of-the-art models, TIS-BiGRU and TIS-Informer, designed to capture short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, respectively. Comparative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of TIS models over conventional predictors, validating the effectiveness of integrating topological information. This work not only advances TDA-based time-series prediction but also opens new avenues for utilizing topological features in deep learning architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experiments are incomplete</p></details> |
| **[On Creating a Causally Grounded Usable Rating Method for Assessing the Robustness of Foundation Models Supporting Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12226v2)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.12226v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have improved time series forecasting in various sectors, such as finance, but their vulnerability to input disturbances can hinder their adoption by stakeholders, such as investors and analysts. To address this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the robustness of Foundational Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input perturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem, a well-studied problem with easily accessible public data, evaluating six state-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning three industries. The ratings proposed by our framework effectively assess the robustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and deployment. Within the scope of our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS exhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions and, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series forecasting task exhibit better robustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS pre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirmed that our ratings reduced the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205v1)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.24205v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Aware Attention-LSTM for PM$_{2.5}$ Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24043v1)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.24043v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the accuracy and robustness of PM$_{2.5}$ concentration forecasting, this paper introduces FALNet, a Frequency-Aware LSTM Network that integrates frequency-domain decomposition, temporal modeling, and attention-based refinement. The model first applies STL and FFT to extract trend, seasonal, and denoised residual components, effectively filtering out high-frequency noise. The filtered residuals are then fed into a stacked LSTM to capture long-term dependencies, followed by a multi-head attention mechanism that dynamically focuses on key time steps. Experiments conducted on real-world urban air quality datasets demonstrate that FALNet consistently outperforms conventional models across standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$. The model shows strong adaptability in capturing sharp fluctuations during pollution peaks and non-stationary conditions. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of FALNet for real-time air pollution prediction, environmental risk assessment, and decision-making support.</p></details> |  |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v1)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.24007v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covariates play an indispensable role in practical time series forecasting, offering rich context from the past and sometimes extending into the future. However, their availability varies depending on the scenario, and situations often involve multiple target variables simultaneously. Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSEAttention is All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23749v5)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.23749v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with referencing, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v5)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2207.05442v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the existence, uniqueness and stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incremental capacity-based multi-feature fusion model for predicting state-of-health of lithium-ion batteries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23858v1)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23858v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lithium-ion batteries have become an indispensable part of human industrial production and daily life. For the safe use, management and maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is an important indicator so that the SOH estimation is of significant practical value. In order to accurately predict SOH, this paper proposes a fusion prediction model which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, bi-directional long-short time memory network (BiLSTM) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. In the proposed prediction model, indirect health indicators (HIs), which characterize battery degradation, are obtained with the help of incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and is fed into BiLSTM to extract time-series features, whose parameters are optimized by employing PSO algorithm. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the PSO-BiLSTM model. The study based on lithium-ion battery data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) shows that the PSO-BiLSTM-AdaBoost model has higher accuracy, better robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17523v3)** | 2025-03-31 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2303.17523v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Feedfoward Neural Networks are Almost All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23621v1)** | 2025-03-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23621v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data are everywhere -- from finance to healthcare -- and each domain brings its own unique complexities and structures. While advanced models like Transformers and graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in time series forecasting, largely due to their success in tasks like language modeling, their added complexity is not always necessary. In our work, we show that simple feedforward neural networks (SFNNs) can achieve performance on par with, or even exceeding, these state-of-the-art models, while being simpler, smaller, faster, and more robust. Our analysis indicates that, in many cases, univariate SFNNs are sufficient, implying that modeling interactions between multiple series may offer only marginal benefits. Even when inter-series relationships are strong, a basic multivariate SFNN still delivers competitive results. We also examine some key design choices and offer guidelines on making informed decisions. Additionally, we critique existing benchmarking practices and propose an improved evaluation protocol. Although SFNNs may not be optimal for every situation (hence the ``almost'' in our title) they serve as a strong baseline that future time series forecasting methods should always be compared against.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-based Bayesian Inference from Privacy Protected Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12781v4)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2310.12781v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many modern statistical analysis and machine learning applications require training models on sensitive user data. Under a formal definition of privacy protection, differentially private algorithms inject calibrated noise into the confidential data or during the data analysis process to produce privacy-protected datasets or queries. However, restricting access to only privatized data during statistical analysis makes it computationally challenging to make valid statistical inferences. In this work, we propose simulation-based inference methods from privacy-protected datasets. In addition to sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation, we adopt neural conditional density estimators as a flexible family of distributions to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters given the observed private query results. We illustrate our methods on discrete time-series data under an infectious disease model and with ordinary linear regression models. Illustrating the privacy-utility trade-off, our experiments and analysis demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of designing valid statistical inference procedures to correct for biases introduced by the privacy-protection mechanisms.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Ethereum Price Prediction Employing Large Language Models for Short-term and Few-shot Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23190v1)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23190v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptocurrencies have transformed financial markets with their innovative blockchain technology and volatile price movements, presenting both challenges and opportunities for predictive analytics. Ethereum, being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant market fluctuations, making its price prediction an attractive yet complex problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting Ethereum prices for short-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios. The main challenge in training models for time series analysis is the lack of data. We address this by leveraging a novel approach that adapts existing pre-trained LLMs on natural language or images from billions of tokens to the unique characteristics of Ethereum price time series data. Through thorough experimentation and comparison with traditional and contemporary models, our results demonstrate that selectively freezing certain layers of pre-trained LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This approach consistently surpasses benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our research not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge on LLMs but also provides practical insights in the cryptocurrency prediction domain. The adaptability of pre-trained LLMs to handle the nature of Ethereum prices suggests a promising direction for future research, potentially including the integration of sentiment analysis to further refine forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a novel multimodal Transformer based framework for predicting the 3 days and 5 days planetary Kp index by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including satellite measurements, solar images, and KP time series. A key innovation is the incorporation of the Wasserstein distance into the transformer and the loss function to align the probability distributions across modalities. Comparative experiments with the NOAA model demonstrate performance, accurately capturing both the quiet and storm phases of geomagnetic activity. This study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with traditional models for improved real time forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This has led to the rapid development of a central aspect of "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations" (AIOps), focusing on detecting anomalies in vast amounts of multivariate time series data generated by service entities. In this paper, we begin by introducing a unifying framework for benchmarking unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods, and highlight the problem of shifts in normal behaviors that can occur in practical AIOps scenarios. To tackle anomaly detection under domain shift, we then cast the problem in the framework of domain generalization and propose a novel approach, Domain-Invariant VAE for Anomaly Detection (DIVAD), to learn domain-invariant representations for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our evaluation results using the Exathlon benchmark show that the two main DIVAD variants significantly outperform the best unsupervised AD method in maximum performance, with 20% and 15% improvements in maximum peak F1-scores, respectively. Evaluation using the Application Server Dataset further demonstrates the broader applicability of our domain generalization methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, "the best of two worlds", from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at AAAI 2025 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

However, applying counterfactual methods to time series models remains challenging due to temporal dependencies, high dimensionality, and the lack of an intuitive human-interpretable representation. We introduce MASCOTS, a method that leverages the Bag-of-Receptive-Fields representation alongside symbolic transformations inspired by Symbolic Aggregate Approximation. By operating in a symbolic feature space, it enhances interpretability while preserving fidelity to the original data and model. Unlike existing approaches that either depend on model structure or autoencoder-based sampling, MASCOTS directly generates meaningful and diverse counterfactual observations in a model-agnostic manner, operating on both univariate and multivariate data. We evaluate MASCOTS on univariate and multivariate benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable validity, proximity, and plausibility to state-of-the-art methods, while significantly improving interpretability and sparsity. Its symbolic nature allows for explanations that can be expressed visually, in natural language, or through semantic representations, making counterfactual reasoning more accessible and actionable.</p></details> |  |

Graph models allow us to capture the hidden dependencies of the multivariate time-series when the graphs are constructed in a similar dynamic manner. Previous dynamic graph models require a pre-defined and/or static graph structure, which is unknown in most cases, or they only capture the spatial relations between the features. Furthermore in healthcare, the interpretability of the model is an essential requirement to build trust with clinicians. In addition to previously proposed attention mechanisms, there has not been an interpretable dynamic graph framework for data from multivariate electronic health records (EHRs). Here, we propose DynaGraph, an end-to-end interpretable contrastive graph model that learns the dynamics of multivariate time-series EHRs as part of optimisation. We validate our model in four real-world clinical datasets, ranging from primary care to secondary care settings with broad demographics, in challenging settings where tasks are imbalanced and multi-labelled. Compared to state-of-the-art models, DynaGraph achieves significant improvements in balanced accuracy and sensitivity over the nearest complex competitors in time-series or dynamic graph modelling across three ICU and one primary care datasets. Through a pseudo-attention approach to graph construction, our model also indicates the importance of clinical covariates over time, providing means for clinical validation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional unsupervised clustering methods often fail to capture the complex nature of time series data. Recent deep learning-based clustering approaches, while effective, struggle with insufficient representation learning and the integration of clustering objectives. To address these issues, we propose a fuzzy cluster-aware contrastive clustering framework (FCACC) that jointly optimizes representation learning and clustering. Our approach introduces a novel three-view data augmentation strategy to enhance feature extraction by leveraging various characteristics of time series data. Additionally, we propose a cluster-aware hard negative sample generation mechanism that dynamically constructs high-quality negative samples using clustering structure information, thereby improving the model's discriminative ability. By leveraging fuzzy clustering, FCACC dynamically generates cluster structures to guide the contrastive learning process, resulting in more accurate clustering. Extensive experiments on 40 benchmark datasets show that FCACC outperforms the selected baseline methods (eight in total), providing an effective solution for unsupervised time series learning.</p></details> |  |

A total of 15 keywords across five categories (English symptoms, Filipino symptoms, face wearing, quarantine, and new normal) were examined using both 15-day and 30-day rolling windows from March 2020 to March 2021. The methodology involved constructing network graphs using distance correlation coefficients at varying thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8) and analyzing the time-series data of network density and clustering coefficients. Results revealed three key findings: (1) an inverse relationship between the threshold values and network metrics, indicating that higher thresholds provide more meaningful keyword relationships; (2) exceptionally high network connectivity during the initial pandemic months followed by gradual decline; and (3) distinct patterns in keyword relationships, transitioning from policy-focused searches to more symptom-specific queries as the pandemic temporally progressed. The 30-day window analysis showed more stable, but less search activities compared to the 15-day windows, suggesting stronger correlations in immediate search behaviors. These insights are helpful for health communication because it emphasizes the need of a strategic and conscientious information dissemination from the government or the private sector based on the networked search behavior (e.g. prioritizing to inform select symptoms rather than an overview of what the coronavirus is).</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print conference submission to ICMHI 2025 (see website here: https://www.icmhi.org/index.html), which it has been accepted.

We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.

However, an analysis reveals certain unfaithfulness issues, including high sensitivity to random seeds and minute input noise perturbations. Recognizing these challenges, we embark on a quest to define the concept of \textbf{\underline{F}aithful \underline{T}ime\underline{S}ieve \underline{(FTS)}}, a model that consistently delivers reliable and robust predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed at identifying and rectifying unfaithfulness in TimeSieve. Our framework is designed to enhance the model's stability and resilience, ensuring that its outputs are less susceptible to the aforementioned factors. Experimentation validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating improved faithfulness in the model's behavior. Looking forward, we plan to expand our experimental scope to further validate and optimize our algorithm, ensuring comprehensive faithfulness across a wide range of scenarios. Ultimately, we aspire to make this framework can be applied to enhance the faithfulness of not just TimeSieve but also other state-of-the-art temporal methods, thereby contributing to the reliability and robustness of temporal modeling as a whole.</p></details> |  |

The method combines Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to extract low-dimensional temporal features from multi-way electricity usage data, with a Genetic Algorithm that optimizes the hyperparameters of time series models applied to the latent annual factors. We model the dataset as a third-order tensor spanning electric utilities, industrial sectors, and years, and apply canonical polyadic decomposition under non-negativity constraints. The annual component is forecasted using autoregressive models, with hyperparameter tuning guided by the prediction error or reconstruction accuracy on a validation set. Comparative experiments using real-world electricity data from Japan demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower mean squared error than baseline approaches without tensor decomposition or evolutionary optimization. Moreover, we find that reducing the model's degrees of freedom via tensor decomposition improves generalization performance, and that initialization sensitivity in NTF can be mitigated through multiple runs or ensemble strategies. These findings suggest that the proposed framework offers an interpretable, flexible, and scalable approach to long-term electricity demand prediction and can be extended to other structured time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

By 2030, urban farming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and vertical farming, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2024 to 2030, according to market reports. This growth is fueled by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, sustainable innovations such as smart growing systems, and the rising interest in green interior design. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates computer vision, machine learning (ML), and environmental sensing for the automated monitoring of plant health and growth. Unlike previous approaches, this framework combines RGB imagery, plant phenotyping data, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, to predict plant water stress in a controlled growth environment. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras to extract phenotypic features, such as RGB, plant area, height, and width while employing the Lag-Llama time series model to analyze and predict water stress. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RGB, size ratios, and environmental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with the Fine-tuned model achieving the lowest errors (MSE = 0.420777, MAE = 0.595428) and reduced uncertainty. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data and intelligent systems to automate plant care, optimize resource consumption, and align indoor gardening with sustainable building management practices, paving the way for resilient, green urban spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3ce)</p></details> |

Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency (relationships within a variable over time) and the inter-variable dependency (relationships between multiple variables) existing in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD. First, we explore the significant potential of graph representation for time-series data and and its contributions to facilitating anomaly detection. Then, we review state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques, mostly leveraging deep learning architectures, in the context of time series. For each method, we discuss its strengths, limitations, and the specific applications where it excels. Finally, we address both the technical and application challenges currently facing the field, and suggest potential future directions for advancing research and improving practical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The model generates probabilistic forecasts using Monte Carlo sampling and also enables the quantification of uncertainty in predictions. While capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies across multiple regions, ProFnet offers a scalable and unified solution for large datasets. Applications to Japan's mortality rates demonstrate superior performance. This approach enhances predictive accuracy and provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a valuable tool for forecasting complex high-dimensional functional data and HDFTS.</p></details> |  |

They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.</p></details> | 30 pages, 23 figures |

However, most existing research focuses on task assignment at the current moment, overlooking the fluctuating demand and supply between tasks and workers over time. To address this issue, we introduce an adaptive task assignment problem, which aims to maximize the number of assigned tasks by dynamically adjusting task assignments in response to changing demand and supply. We develop a spatial crowdsourcing framework, namely demand-based adaptive task assignment with dynamic worker availability windows, which consists of two components including task demand prediction and task assignment. In the first component, we construct a graph adjacency matrix representing the demand dependency relationships in different regions and employ a multivariate time series learning approach to predict future task demands. In the task assignment component, we adjust tasks to workers based on these predictions, worker availability windows, and the current task assignments, where each worker has an availability window that indicates the time periods they are available for task assignments. To reduce the search space of task assignments and be efficient, we propose a worker dependency separation approach based on graph partition and a task value function with reinforcement learning. Experiments on real data demonstrate that our proposals are both effective and efficient.</p></details> |  |

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a mainstream approach for addressing forecasting uncertainties, with Conformal Prediction (CP) gaining attention due to its model-agnostic nature and statistical guarantees. However, most variants of CP are designed for single-step predictions and face challenges in multi-step scenarios, such as reliance on real-time data and limited scalability. This highlights the need for CP methods specifically tailored to multi-step forecasting. We propose the Dual-Splitting Conformal Prediction (DSCP) method, a novel CP approach designed to capture inherent dependencies within time-series data for multi-step forecasting. Experimental results on real-world datasets from four different domains demonstrate that the proposed DSCP significantly outperforms existing CP variants in terms of the Winkler Score, achieving a performance improvement of up to 23.59% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose an \emph{Adaptive State-Space Mamba} (\textbf{ASSM}) framework for real-time sensor data anomaly detection. While state-space models have been previously employed for image processing applications (e.g., style transfer \cite{wang2024stylemamba}), our approach leverages the core idea of sequential hidden states to tackle a significantly different domain: detecting anomalies on streaming sensor data. In particular, we introduce an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically modulates the hidden state update based on contextual and learned statistical cues. This design ensures that our model remains computationally efficient and scalable, even under rapid data arrival rates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic sensor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance compared to existing baselines. Our approach is easily extensible to other time-series tasks that demand rapid and reliable detection capabilities.</p></details> |  |

While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose AdapTS to answer this question. AdapTS is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. AdapTS consists of two parts: a) the AdapTS-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the AdapTS-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the AdapTS-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of AdapTS in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using AdapTS improves performance.

Unfortunately, privacy risks in FL persist, as servers can potentially reconstruct clients' training data through gradient inversion attacks (GIA). Although GIA is demonstrated for image classification tasks, little is known about time series regression tasks. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive empirical study on inverting TS data across 4 TSF models and 4 datasets, identifying the unique challenges of reconstructing both observations and targets of TS data. We then propose TS-Inverse, a novel GIA that improves the inversion of TS data by (i) learning a gradient inversion model that outputs quantile predictions, (ii) a unique loss function that incorporates periodicity and trend regularization, and (iii) regularization according to the quantile predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate a remarkable performance of TS-Inverse, achieving at least a 2x-10x improvement in terms of the sMAPE metric over existing GIA methods on TS data.

| **[Agent-Based Analysis of the Impact of Near Real-Time Data and Smart Balancing on the Frequency Stability of Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20665v1)** | 2025-03-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.20665v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single imbalance pricing provides an incentive to balance responsible parties (BRPs) to intentionally introduce power schedule deviations in order to reduce the control area imbalance and receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. This is called smart balancing or passive balancing and is actively encouraged in, e.g., the Netherlands and Belgium through the publication of near real-time (NRT) data on the control area imbalance by the transmission system operator. It is known that under certain conditions, smart balancing can deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This paper examines how the publication of different types of NRT data affects smart balancing and the frequency stability. A Monte-Carlo simulation of a dynamic multi-agent model is performed to analyse the effects of smart balancing with different parameters for the agents and the environment, using historical time series of the power imbalance of the German control block as a basis. It is found that smart balancing can significantly reduce the amount and cost of frequency restoration reserve activation, but leads to a general increase of the frequency variability. Depending on the type of NRT data and agent parameters, the frequency stability margins are also reduced. The negative effects on the frequency stability are stronger when NRT data is published using large bins and with long delays.</p></details> |  |

However, the traffic security becomes the key threatening public safety issue in an emergency rescue system due to the increasing vulnerability of UAVs to cyber attacks in environments with high heterogeneities. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel anomaly traffic detection architecture for UAV networks based on the software-defined networking (SDN) framework and blockchain technology. Specifically, SDN separates the control and data plane to enhance the network manageability and security. Meanwhile, the blockchain provides decentralized identity authentication and data security records. Beisdes, a complete security architecture requires an effective mechanism to detect the time-series based abnormal traffic. Thus, an integrated algorithm combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer (CNN+Transformer) for anomaly traffic detection is developed, which is called CTranATD. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed CTranATD algorithm is effective and outperforms the individual CNN, Transformer, and LSTM algorithms for detecting anomaly traffic.</p></details> |  |

However, in this paper, by performing permutation tests that disrupt temporal information on the UCR time series classification archive, the most widely used benchmark for time series classification, we identify a significant proportion of datasets where temporal information has little to no impact on classification. Many of these datasets are tabular in nature or rely mainly on tabular features, leading to potentially biased evaluations of time series classifiers focused on temporal information. To address this, we propose UCR Augmented, a benchmark based on the UCR time series classification archive designed to evaluate classifiers' ability to extract and utilize temporal information. Testing classifiers from seven categories on this benchmark revealed notable shifts in performance rankings. Some previously overlooked approaches perform well, while others see their performance decline significantly when temporal information is crucial. UCR Augmented provides a more robust framework for assessing time series classifiers, ensuring fairer evaluations.

TikTok's For You feed exemplifies extreme algorithm-driven curation, tailoring the stream of video content almost exclusively based on users' explicit and implicit interactions with the platform. Despite growing attention, the dynamics of content amplification on TikTok remain largely unquantified. How quickly, and to what extent, does TikTok's algorithm amplify content aligned with users' interests? To address these questions, we conduct a sock-puppet audit, deploying bots with different interests to engage with TikTok's "For You" feed. Our findings reveal that content aligned with the bots' interests undergoes strong amplification, with rapid reinforcement typically occurring within the first 200 videos watched. While amplification is consistently observed across all interests, its intensity varies by interest, indicating the emergence of topic-specific biases. Time series analyses and Markov models uncover distinct phases of recommendation dynamics, including persistent content reinforcement and a gradual decline in content diversity over time. Although TikTok's algorithm preserves some content diversity, we find a strong negative correlation between amplification and exploration: as the amplification of interest-aligned content increases, engagement with unseen hashtags declines. These findings contribute to discussions on socio-algorithmic feedback loops in the digital age and the trade-offs between personalization and content diversity.</p></details> | 34 pages |

Modern management systems increasingly rely on analyzing this data, highlighting the importance of effcient processing techniques. State-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) approaches for TS analysis and forecasting are becoming prevalent. This paper briefly describes and compiles suitable algorithms for TS regression task. We compare these algorithms against each other and the classic ARIMA method using diverse datasets: complete data, data with outliers, and data with missing values. The focus is on forecasting accuracy, particularly for long-term predictions. This research aids in selecting the most appropriate algorithm based on forecasting needs and data characteristics.</p></details> |  |

This approach addresses a crucial challenge: how can models utilize physics or mathematical principles to enhance predictions when dealing with sparse, noisy, or incomplete data? Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) put this idea into practice by incorporating physical equations, such as Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), as soft constraints. This guidance helps the networks find solutions that align with established laws. Recently, researchers have expanded this framework to include Bayesian NNs (BNNs), which allow for uncertainty quantification while still adhering to physical principles. But what happens when the governing equations of a system are not known? In this work, we introduce methods to automatically extract PDEs from historical data. We then integrate these learned equations into three different modeling approaches: PINNs, Bayesian-PINNs (B-PINNs), and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR). To assess these frameworks, we evaluate them on a real-world Multivariate Time Series (MTS) dataset. We compare their effectiveness in forecasting future states under different scenarios: with and without PDE constraints and accuracy considerations. This research aims to bridge the gap between data-driven discovery and physics-guided learning, providing valuable insights for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often experience overfitting due to data redundancy in rolling forecasting settings, limiting their generalization ability particularly evident in longer sequences with highly similar adjacent data. In this work, we introduce CLMFormer, a novel framework that mitigates redundancy through curriculum learning and a memory-driven decoder. Specifically, we progressively introduce Bernoulli noise to the training samples, which effectively breaks the high similarity between adjacent data points. This curriculum-driven noise introduction aids the memory-driven decoder by supplying more diverse and representative training data, enhancing the decoder's ability to model seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data. To further enhance forecasting accuracy, we introduce a memory-driven decoder. This component enables the model to capture seasonal tendencies and dependencies in the time-series data and leverages temporal relationships to facilitate the forecasting process. Extensive experiments on six real-world LTSF benchmarks show that CLMFormer consistently improves Transformer-based models by up to 30%, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-horizon forecasting.</p></details> | ACM TIST |

Many perturbations induce compensatory cellular responses, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect effects on gene regulation. Modeling how gene regulatory functions shape the temporal dynamics of these responses is key to improving our understanding of biological perturbations. Dynamical models based on differential equations offer a principled way to capture transcriptional dynamics, but their application to single-cell data has been hindered by computational constraints, stochasticity, sparsity, and noise. Existing methods either rely on low-dimensional representations or make strong simplifying assumptions, limiting their ability to model transcriptional dynamics at scale. We introduce a Functional and Learnable model of Cell dynamicS, FLeCS, that incorporates gene network structure into coupled differential equations to model gene regulatory functions. Given (pseudo)time-series single-cell data, FLeCS accurately infers cell dynamics at scale, provides improved functional insights into transcriptional mechanisms perturbed by gene knockouts, both in myeloid differentiation and K562 Perturb-seq experiments, and simulates single-cell trajectories of A549 cells following small-molecule perturbations.</p></details> | 42 pages, 10 figures |

For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | 46 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Towards Reliable Time Series Forecasting under Future Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Novelty Rejection Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19656v1)** | 2025-03-25 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19656v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world time series forecasting, uncertainty and lack of reliable evaluation pose significant challenges. Notably, forecasting errors often arise from underfitting in-distribution data and failing to handle out-of-distribution inputs. To enhance model reliability, we introduce a dual rejection mechanism combining ambiguity and novelty rejection. Ambiguity rejection, using prediction error variance, allows the model to abstain under low confidence, assessed through historical error variance analysis without future ground truth. Novelty rejection, employing Variational Autoencoders and Mahalanobis distance, detects deviations from training data. This dual approach improves forecasting reliability in dynamic environments by reducing errors and adapting to data changes, advancing reliability in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |

Imperceptibility is crucial, as adversarial examples detected by the human vision system (HVS) can render attacks ineffective. Many existing methods fail to produce high-quality imperceptible examples, often generating perturbations with more perceptible low-frequency components, like square waves, and global perturbations that reduce stealthiness. This paper aims to improve the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on TSC models by addressing frequency components and time series locality. We propose the Shapelet-based Frequency-domain Attack (SFAttack), which uses local perturbations focused on time series shapelets to enhance discriminative information and stealthiness. Additionally, we introduce a low-frequency constraint to confine perturbations to high-frequency components, enhancing imperceptibility.</p></details> |  |

However, current public datasets have limitations in reflecting the distribution shift nature of real-world scenarios, characterized by continuously evolving infrastructures, varying temporal distributions, and long temporal gaps due to sensor downtimes or changes in traffic patterns. These limitations inevitably restrict the practical applicability of existing traffic forecasting datasets. To bridge this gap, we present XXLTraffic, largest available public traffic dataset with the longest timespan collected from Los Angeles, USA, and New South Wales, Australia, curated to support research in extremely long forecasting beyond test adaptation. Our benchmark includes both typical time-series forecasting settings with hourly and daily aggregated data and novel configurations that introduce gaps and down-sample the training size to better simulate practical constraints. We anticipate the new XXLTraffic will provide a fresh perspective for the time-series and traffic forecasting communities. It would also offer a robust platform for developing and evaluating models designed to tackle the extremely long forecasting problems beyond test adaptation. Our dataset supplements existing spatio-temporal data resources and leads to new research directions in this domain.</p></details> |  |

Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/). Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled). Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format. Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |

For example, while "addressing parents by name" is commonplace in the West, it is rare in most Asian cultures. Adherence or violation of such norms often dictates the tenor of conversations. Humans are able to navigate social situations requiring cultural awareness quite adeptly. However, it is a hard task for NLP models. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a "Cultural Context Schema" for conversations. It comprises (1) conversational information such as emotions, dialogue acts, etc., and (2) cultural information such as social norms, violations, etc. We generate ~110k social norm and violation descriptions for ~23k conversations from Chinese culture using LLMs. We refine them using automated verification strategies which are evaluated against culturally aware human judgements. We organize these descriptions into meaningful structures we call "Norm Concepts", using an interactive human-in-loop framework. We ground the norm concepts and the descriptions in conversations using symbolic annotation. Finally, we use the obtained dataset for downstream tasks such as emotion, sentiment, and dialogue act detection. We show that it significantly improves the empirical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral at NAACL 2025 Main conference. Albuquerque, USA.

To this end, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.</p></details> |  |

Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as several models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.

RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust and Parameter-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621v4)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.06621v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact.

While existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT employs sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction, along with consensus-guided decision-making strategies to optimize both correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

By replacing the core-layer electrical packet switches by optical circuit switches, \emph{LumosCore} could achieves $2\times$ increase in bandwidth or $8\times$ increase in network size. We offer the detailed design of \emph{LumosCore} at both deployment stage and running stage. At deployment stage, we propose Interleaved Wiring, which is compatible with all possible logical topologies. At running stage, we design polynomial-time algorithms for GPU placement, logical topology generating and OCS reconfiguration to minimize network contention and reduce impact to scheduled jobs. We evaluate \emph{LumosCore} using both testbed experiments and large-scale simulation. Compared to traditional hybrid optical/electrical architectures, \emph{LumosCore} increases the end-to-end training throughput by up to 39.5\% on a 128-node testbed.

In practical scenarios like recommendations, as users increasingly seek personalized experiences, it becomes crucial to incorporate user interaction history into the context of LLMs to enhance personalization. However, from a practical utility perspective, user interactions' extensive length and noise present challenges when used directly as text prompts. A promising solution is to compress and distill interactions into compact embeddings, serving as soft prompts to assist LLMs in generating personalized responses. Although this approach brings efficiency, a critical concern emerges: Can user embeddings adequately capture valuable information and prompt LLMs? To address this concern, we propose \name, a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of user embeddings in prompting LLMs for personalization. We establish a fair and standardized evaluation process, encompassing pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. To thoroughly evaluate user embeddings, we design three dimensions of tasks: sequence understanding, action prediction, and interest perception. These evaluation tasks cover the industry's demands in traditional recommendation tasks, such as improving prediction accuracy, and its aspirations for LLM-based methods, such as accurately understanding user interests and enhancing the user experience. We conduct extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art methods for modeling user embeddings. Additionally, we reveal the scaling laws of leveraging user embeddings to prompt LLMs. The benchmark is available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code.

Unfortunately, modern applications codebases exhibit highly variant behavior across different inputs, creating challenges for conventional profiling approaches that rely on a single representative execution instance. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Phaedrus}, a new \textit{compiler-assisted deep learning framework} designed to predict dynamic program behaviors across varied execution instances, specifically focusing on dynamic function call prediction.Such predicted call sequences are then used for producing optimized code pertinent to a given input. Traditional profile-guided optimization methods struggle with the input-dependent variability of modern applications, where profiling on different inputs yields divergent application behaviors. To address this, Phaedrus proposes two new approaches: \textit{Application Behavior Synthesis}, a profile-less approach where Large Language Models (LLMs) directly infer dynamic functions based on source code \& static compiler analysis, bypassing the need for traditional profiling, and \textit{Application Profile Generalization}, which uses generative models trained on compressed and augmented \textit{Whole Program Path} (WPP) based function profiles to predict application behavior under unseen inputs. Our experiments show that \textit{Phaedrus} can achieve upto $10^7X$ reduction in WPP function profile sizes, can predict most frequently executed functions that cover upto 85-99\% of the execution time, along with an average of 13.68\% (upto 65\%) reduction in application binary size, and an average of 2.8\% performance improvement over the traditional profile-guided optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown that incorporating advanced planning algorithms, e.g., tree search, is advantageous over reactive planning for web agents. However, unlike simulated sandbox environments, real-world environments such as the web are rife with irreversible actions. This undermines the feasibility of backtracking, a cornerstone of (tree) search. Overly relying on test-time search also hurts efficiency. We advocate model-based planning for web agents that employs a world model to simulate and deliberate over the outcome of each candidate action before committing to one. We systematically explore this paradigm by (1) Proposing a model-based planning framework, WebDreamer, which employs LLMs to serve as both world models and value functions; (2) Training specialized LLMs as world models with a scalable data synthesis pipeline. Empirical results demonstrate that WebDreamer achieves substantial performance improvements over reactive baselines. It is competitive, while being 4-5 times more efficient, with tree search in sandbox environments (VisualWebArena) and also works effectively on real-world websites (Online-Mind2Web and Mind2Web-Live). Furthermore, our trained world model, Dreamer-7B, performs comparable to GPT-4o, highlighting the potential of specialized world models for efficient and effective planning in complex web environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Specially, we aim to enhance the coding ability of LLM and lead it to better teaching mode in education context. Thus, we propose an end-to-end prior-based three-phases supervised fine-tuned model, which is proved more competitive than traditional fine-tuning method. More specifically, our model realizes the structural disassembly and incremental guided output of educational knowledge. To this end, we robustify data classification of three types via a sampler and overlap estimation neural network, and inject the preprocessing datasets into pre-trained model in three batches for LORA fine-tuning. Then, we design a prior module couples system prompt, vector databases, and abstract syntax tree task segmentation. Finally, the compression method and regularization constraint are applied to the prior-based fine-tuned model, followed by text filter at the output end to obtain incremental guided results. Our model represents the first research effort to truly embody the tutor role with the features of abundant educational knowledge, step-by-step incremental guided outputs and non-disclosure of answers. Extensive experiments report that our model also achieves state-of-the-art in code abilities compared to open-source models, reaching an impressive 75.10% on the HumanEval (@pass 1) benchmark. Additionally, our model maintains strong conversational capabilities, with the 13B quantized version achieving scores of 56.34, 50.60, and 45.27 respectively on the MMLU, C-Eval, and AGIEval (5 shot) dialogue evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Yet the questions of how pervasive this is, and with what impact on results, have not to our knowledge been systematically investigated. We investigate non-determinism in five LLMs configured to be deterministic when applied to eight common tasks in across 10 runs, in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. We see accuracy variations up to 15% across naturally occurring runs with a gap of best possible performance to worst possible performance up to 70%. In fact, none of the LLMs consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks, much less identical output strings. Sharing preliminary results with insiders has revealed that non-determinism perhaps essential to the efficient use of compute resources via co-mingled data in input buffers so this issue is not going away anytime soon. To better quantify our observations, we introduce metrics focused on quantifying determinism, TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement rate of parsed-out answers.

A Token Complexity Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01141v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.01141v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought prompting has emerged as a powerful technique for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve complex reasoning tasks. However, these reasoning chains can be verbose, raising concerns about efficiency. In response, recent works have sought to decrease response lengths through simple prompting strategies (e.g. 'be concise'). In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between reasoning length and model performance across a diverse range of compression instructions (e.g. 'use 10 words or less' or 'remove all punctuation'). In doing so, we discover a universal tradeoff between reasoning length and accuracy that persists across even very distinct reasoning chains. We demonstrate that this tradeoff emerges from a sharp threshold behavior at the question level: each task has an intrinsic 'token complexity' - a minimal number of tokens required for successful problem-solving. We show how token complexity enables us to compute information-theoretic limits on the accuracy-compression tradeoff, and find that prompt-based compression strategies operate far from these theoretical limits. This suggests there may be significant room for improvement and our framework provides a benchmark to help researchers evaluate progress in reasoning efficiency. Our work also highlights the importance of adaptive compression -- giving shorter responses for easier questions -- and we show that token complexity is a useful tool for measuring this capability.</p></details> |  |

Manipulated Ending Tokens Can Mislead Reasoning LLMs to Ignore the Correct Reasoning Steps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19326v2)** | 2025-04-01 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.19326v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in mathematical reasoning capabilities through long Chain-of-Thought. The reasoning tokens of these models enable self-correction within reasoning chains, enhancing robustness. This motivates our exploration: how vulnerable are reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input reasoning chains? We introduce "Compromising Thought" (CPT), a vulnerability where models presented with reasoning tokens containing manipulated calculation results tend to ignore correct reasoning steps and adopt incorrect results instead. Through systematic evaluation across multiple reasoning LLMs, we design three increasingly explicit prompting methods to measure CPT resistance, revealing that models struggle significantly to identify and correct these manipulations. Notably, contrary to existing research suggesting structural alterations affect model performance more than content modifications, we find that local ending token manipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural changes. Moreover, we discover a security vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1 where tampered reasoning tokens can trigger complete reasoning cessation. Our work enhances understanding of reasoning robustness and highlights security considerations for reasoning-intensive applications.</p></details> |  |

Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets, our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing satisfaction in credit services.</p></details> |  |

Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and recently Large Language Models are widely used to detect security flaws. This paper introduces CASTLE (CWE Automated Security Testing and Low-Level Evaluation), a benchmarking framework for evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of different methods. We assess 13 static analysis tools, 10 LLMs, and 2 formal verification tools using a hand-crafted dataset of 250 micro-benchmark programs covering 25 common CWEs. We propose the CASTLE Score, a novel evaluation metric to ensure fair comparison. Our results reveal key differences: ESBMC (a formal verification tool) minimizes false positives but struggles with vulnerabilities beyond model checking, such as weak cryptography or SQL injection. Static analyzers suffer from high false positives, increasing manual validation efforts for developers. LLMs perform exceptionally well in the CASTLE dataset when identifying vulnerabilities in small code snippets. However, their accuracy declines, and hallucinations increase as the code size grows. These results suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in future security solutions, particularly within code completion frameworks, where they can provide real-time guidance to prevent vulnerabilities.

However, LLMs are still facing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like telecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to evolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines knowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to capture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols, standards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing their relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response generation. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing accuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex technical queries with precision.

In this work, we reveal a critical control-plane attack surface orthogonal to traditional data-plane vulnerabilities. We introduce Constrained Decoding Attack (CDA), a novel jailbreak class that weaponizes structured output constraints to bypass safety mechanisms. Unlike prior attacks focused on input prompts, CDA operates by embedding malicious intent in schema-level grammar rules (control-plane) while maintaining benign surface prompts (data-plane). We instantiate this with a proof-of-concept Chain Enum Attack, achieves 96.2% attack success rates across proprietary and open-weight LLMs on five safety benchmarks with a single query, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-flash.

This paper systematically evaluates the limitations of current LLMs across 200 languages using benchmarks such as FLORES-200. We also explore alternative data sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained models can significantly improve smaller LRL translations.

However, LLMs still produce outputs containing hallucinations, that is, content not grounded in factual information. Therefore, developing methods to assess the factuality of LLMs has become urgent. Indeed, resources for factuality evaluation have recently emerged. Although challenging, these resources face one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are tailored to a specific task or domain; (ii) they are limited in size, thereby preventing the training of new factuality evaluators; (iii) they are designed for simpler verification tasks, such as claim verification. To address these issues, we introduce LLM-Oasis, to the best of our knowledge the largest resource for training end-to-end factuality evaluators. LLM-Oasis is constructed by extracting claims from Wikipedia, falsifying a subset of these claims, and generating pairs of factual and unfactual texts. We then rely on human annotators to both validate the quality of our dataset and to create a gold standard test set for benchmarking factuality evaluation systems. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-Oasis presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art LLMs, with GPT-4o achieving up to 60% accuracy in our proposed end-to-end factuality evaluation task, highlighting its potential to drive future research in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

Despite great efforts to optimize LLM inference, end-to-end workflow optimization has been overlooked. Existing frameworks employ coarse-grained orchestration with task modules, which confines optimizations to within each module and yields suboptimal scheduling decisions. We propose fine-grained end-to-end orchestration, which utilizes task primitives as the basic units and represents each query's workflow as a primitive-level dataflow graph. This explicitly exposes a much larger design space, enables optimizations in parallelization and pipelining across primitives of different modules, and enhances scheduling to improve application-level performance. We build Teola, a novel orchestration framework for LLM-based applications that implements this scheme. Comprehensive experiments show that Teola can achieve up to 2.09x speedup over existing systems across various popular LLM applications.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating unit test cases. However, several problems limit their ability to generate high-quality unit test cases: (1) compilation and runtime errors caused by the hallucination of LLMs; (2) lack of testing and coverage feedback information restricting the increase of code coverage;(3) the repetitive suppression problem causing invalid LLM-based repair and generation attempts. To address these limitations, we propose TestART, a novel unit test generation method. TestART improves LLM-based unit testing via co-evolution of automated generation and repair iteration, representing a significant advancement in automated unit test generation. TestART leverages the template-based repair strategy to effectively fix bugs in LLM-generated test cases for the first time. Meanwhile, TestART extracts coverage information from successful test cases and uses it as coverage-guided testing feedback. It also incorporates positive prompt injection to prevent repetition suppression, thereby enhancing the sufficiency of the final test case. This synergy between generation and repair elevates the correctness and sufficiency of the produced test cases significantly beyond previous methods. In comparative experiments, TestART demonstrates an 18% improvement in pass rate and a 20% enhancement in coverage across three types of datasets compared to baseline models. Additionally, it achieves better coverage rates than EvoSuite with only half the number of test cases. These results demonstrate TestART's superior ability to produce high-quality unit test cases by harnessing the power of LLMs while overcoming their inherent flaws.</p></details> |  |

However, most uncertainty quantification methods have been evaluated on single-labeled questions, which removes data uncertainty: the irreducible randomness often present in user queries, which can arise from factors like multiple possible answers. This limitation may cause uncertainty quantification results to be unreliable in practical settings. In this paper, we investigate previous uncertainty quantification methods under the presence of data uncertainty. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) proposing a new Multi-Answer Question Answering dataset, MAQA, consisting of world knowledge, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning tasks to evaluate uncertainty quantification regarding data uncertainty, and 2) assessing 5 uncertainty quantification methods of diverse white- and black-box LLMs. Our findings show that previous methods relatively struggle compared to single-answer settings, though this varies depending on the task. Moreover, we observe that entropy- and consistency-based methods effectively estimate model uncertainty, even in the presence of data uncertainty. We believe these observations will guide future work on uncertainty quantification in more realistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> |

While code generation remains a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains a problem with no conclusive solution. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using question-specific rubrics tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use question-agnostic rubrics. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that question-specific rubrics significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.</p></details> | Under Review |

EGSW integrates entropy regularization with advantage-based weighting to balance policy updates, enabling efficient exploration in high-dimensional state spaces. By employing temperature-scaled softmax weighting over sequences, EGSW prioritizing high-reward, high-uncertainty steps while maintaining training stability. Although originally developed to improve Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, EGSW is generalizable to other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and can be implemented in both step-wise and trajectory-wise settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that EGSW enhances GRPO reasoning ability, yielding improvements in sample efficiency. Future work will explore the application of EGSW to advanced RL methodologies.</p></details> |  |

Our solution employs a comprehensive pipeline including metadata generation, dialogue scripting, paralinguistic-enriched utterance simulation, and natural speech synthesis with voice cloning. Additionally, the system provides an interactive UI for detailed sample inspection and a high-throughput batch synthesis mode. Evaluations show that dialogues generated by our system achieve a quality comparable to human recordings while significantly reducing production costs.

Processing-Using-DRAM (PUD), an analog in-DRAM computing technique, has the potential to repurpose on-device DRAM as a GeMV engine, offering additional high-throughput processing capabilities to widespread consumer devices without DRAM modifications. However, applying PUD to GeMV operations in the LLM inference pipeline incurs significant overheads $\textit{before}$ and $\textit{after}$ in-DRAM computation, diminishing the benefits of its high-throughput processing capabilities. This paper presents MVDRAM, the first practical system to accelerate GeMV operations for low-bit LLM inference using unmodified DRAM. By leveraging the data sharing patterns and mathematical linearity in GeMV operations, MVDRAM orchestrates the processor and DRAM to eliminate the costs associated with pre-arranging inputs and bit-transposition of outputs required in conventional PUD approaches. Our experimental evaluation with four DDR4 DRAM modules shows that MVDRAM achieves comparable or even better inference speed than the processor-based implementation for GeMV operations in low-bit (under 4-bit) LLM. In particular, MVDRAM achieves up to 7.29$\times$ speedup and 30.5$\times$ energy efficiency for low-bit GeMV operations. For end-to-end LLM inference, MVDRAM achieves 2.18$\times$ and 1.31$\times$ throughput improvements, along with 3.04$\times$ and 2.35$\times$ energy efficiency, for 2-bit and 4-bit quantized low-bit models, respectively. MVDRAM has the potential to redefine the AI hardware landscape by demonstrating the feasibility of standard DRAM as an LLM accelerator.</p></details> |  |

However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.</p></details> |  |

New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/floatSDSDS/LANID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

However, these smart contracts are vulnerable to exploitable bugs that can lead to substantial monetary losses. A recent study reveals that over 80% of these exploitable bugs, which are primarily functional bugs, can evade the detection of current tools. The primary issue is the significant gap between understanding the high-level logic of the business model and checking the low-level implementations in smart contracts. Furthermore, identifying deeply rooted functional bugs in smart contracts requires the automated generation of effective detection oracles based on various bug features. To address these challenges, we design and implement PROMFUZZ, an automated and scalable system to detect functional bugs, in smart contracts. In PROMFUZZ, we first propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-driven analysis framework, which leverages a dual-agent prompt engineering strategy to pinpoint potentially vulnerable functions for further scrutiny. We then implement a dual-stage coupling approach, which focuses on generating invariant checkers that leverage logic information extracted from potentially vulnerable functions. Finally, we design a bug-oriented fuzzing engine, which maps the logical information from the high-level business model to the low-level smart contract implementations, and performs the bug-oriented fuzzing on targeted functions. We compare PROMFUZZ with multiple state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PROMFUZZ achieves 86.96% recall and 93.02% F1-score in detecting functional bugs, marking at least a 50% improvement in both metrics over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we perform an in-depth analysis on real-world DeFi projects and detect 30 zero-day bugs. Up to now, 24 zero-day bugs have been assigned CVE IDs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, they have been shown to surpass specialized models in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Nevertheless, their performance under different image conditions remains insufficiently investigated, and individual character recognition is not guaranteed due to their reliance on contextual cues. In this work, we examine a context-independent OCR task using single-character images with diverse visual complexities to determine the conditions for accurate recognition. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs can match conventional OCR methods at about 300 ppi, yet their performance deteriorates significantly below 150 ppi. Additionally, we observe a very weak correlation between visual complexity and misrecognitions, whereas a conventional OCR-specific model exhibits no correlation. These results suggest that image resolution and visual complexity may play an important role in the reliable application of multimodal LLMs to OCR tasks that require precise character-level accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Recent research shows the promise of LLMs in applying psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing (MI). However, there is a lack of studies investigating how language models understand MI ethics. Given the risks that malicious actors can use language models to apply MI for unethical purposes, it is important to evaluate their capability of differentiating ethical and unethical MI practices. Thus, this study investigates the ethical awareness of LLMs in MI with multiple experiments. Our findings show that LLMs have a moderate to strong level of knowledge in MI. However, their ethical standards are not aligned with the MI spirit, as they generated unethical responses and performed poorly in detecting unethical responses. We proposed a Chain-of-Ethic prompt to mitigate those risks and improve safety. Finally, our proposed strategy effectively improved ethical MI response generation and detection performance. These findings highlight the need for safety evaluations and guidelines for building ethical LLM-powered psychotherapy.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged, due to LLM judges' biases and inconsistent decision-making. Previous research has developed evaluation frameworks to assess reliability of LLM judges and their alignment with human preferences. However, the employed evaluation metrics often lack adequate explainability and fail to address LLM internal inconsistency. Additionally, existing studies inadequately explore the impact of various prompt templates when applying LLM-as-a-Judge methods, leading to potentially inconsistent comparisons between different alignment algorithms. In this work, we systematically evaluate LLM-as-a-Judge on alignment tasks by defining more theoretically interpretable evaluation metrics and explicitly mitigating LLM internal inconsistency from reliability metrics. We develop an open-source framework to evaluate, compare, and visualize the reliability and alignment of LLM judges, which facilitates practitioners to choose LLM judges for alignment tasks. In the experiments, we examine effects of diverse prompt templates on LLM-judge reliability and also demonstrate our developed framework by comparing various LLM judges on two common alignment datasets (i.e., TL;DR Summarization and HH-RLHF-Helpfulness). Our results indicate a significant impact of prompt templates on LLM judge performance, as well as a mediocre alignment level between the tested LLM judges and human evaluators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Building Trust in LLMs and LLM Applications workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Evaluating Lifelong Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23514v1)** | 2025-03-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.23514v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can carry out human-like dialogue, but unlike humans, they are stateless due to the superposition property. However, during multi-turn, multi-agent interactions, LLMs begin to exhibit consistent, character-like behaviors, hinting at a form of emergent lifelong learning. Despite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics, primarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in LLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script collection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact checking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval, and relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek R1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform parametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit challenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting the need for further advancements in lifelong learning.</p></details> |  |

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval-augmented generation and agentic frameworks such as Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) can address this issue by giving the model access to external knowledge. However, LLMs often fail to remain faithful to retrieved information. Mitigating this is critical, especially if LLMs are required to reason about the retrieved information. Recent research has explored training-free decoding strategies to improve the faithfulness of model generations. We present a systematic analysis of how the combination of the ReAct framework and decoding strategies (i.e., DeCoRe, DoLa, and CAD) can influence the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers. Our results show that combining an agentic framework for knowledge retrieval with decoding methods that enhance faithfulness can increase accuracy on the downstream Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks. For example, we observe an F1 increase from 19.5 to 32.6 on HotpotQA when using ReAct and DoLa.</p></details> |  |

Although it is vital for improving the performance of models, it demands considerable human expertise and deep domain knowledge, making it labor-intensive endeavor. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{FeRG-LLM} (\textbf{Fe}ature engineering by \textbf{R}eason \textbf{G}eneration \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odels), a large language model designed to automatically perform feature engineering at an 8-billion-parameter scale.

Our experiments show that FeRG-LLM performs comparably to or better than Llama 3.1 70B on most datasets, while using fewer resources and achieving reduced inference time. It outperforms other studies in classification tasks and performs well in regression tasks.

Key-Value Cache (KVCache), the intermediate representations of tokens within LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques prevalent in the data management community, we consider the storage and retrieval of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, we use PQ codes and centroids to approximately identify important preceding tokens, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency, with 4.60% score improvement over existing methods on InfiniteBench and low system latency in both prefilling and decoding.</p></details> |  |

However, current research lacks a in-depth analysis of the superior and applicable scenarios of each PTQ strategy. In addition, existing algorithms focus primarily on performance, overlooking the trade-off among model size, performance, and quantization bitwidth. To mitigate these confusions, we provide a novel benchmark for LLMs PTQ in this paper. Firstly, in order to support our benchmark, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy for existing mainstream methods by scrutinizing their computational strategies (e.g., optimization-based, compensation-based, etc.). Then, we conduct extensive experiments with the baseline within each class, covering models with various sizes (7B-70B), bitwidths, training levels (LLaMA1/2/3/3.1), architectures (Mixtral, DeepSeekMoE and Mamba) and modality (LLaVA1.5 and VILA1.5) on a wide range of evaluation metrics.Through comparative analysis on the results, we summarize the superior of each PTQ strategy and modelsize-bitwidth trade-off considering the performance. For example, our benchmark reveals that compensation-based technique demonstrates outstanding cross-architecture robustness and extremely low-bit PTQ for ultra large models should be reexamined. Finally, we further accordingly claim that a practical combination of compensation and other PTQ strategy can achieve SOTA various robustness. We believe that our benchmark will provide valuable recommendations for the deployment of LLMs and future research on PTQ approaches.We conduct an repository for our benchmark at https://github.com/zjq0455/PTQ_Benchmark.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 fugures |

While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, a context that is too long may cause intolerant inference latency and GPU memory usage. Existing methods propose mixed-precision quantization to the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs based on token granularity, which is time-consuming in the search process and hardware inefficient during computation. This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Design, Automation, and Test in Europe 2025 (DATE 2025)</p></details> |

Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities). In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 14 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior agent frameworks by up to 4.3X.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike previous approaches that aim to detect these attacks on a best-effort basis, this paper introduces a novel method that appends an Encrypted Prompt to each user prompt, embedding current permissions. These permissions are verified before executing any actions (such as API calls) generated by the LLM. If the permissions are insufficient, the LLM's actions will not be executed, ensuring safety. This approach guarantees that only actions within the scope of the current permissions from the LLM can proceed. In scenarios where adversarial prompts are introduced to mislead the LLM, this method ensures that any unauthorized actions from LLM wouldn't be executed by verifying permissions in Encrypted Prompt. Thus, threats like prompt injection attacks that trigger LLM to generate harmful actions can be effectively mitigated.</p></details> |  |

This literature emphasizes the improved performance of LLMs relative to other natural language models, noting that LLMs typically outperform other models on standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, previous literature has also highlighted the bias embedded in language models, particularly around contentious topics such as potentially toxic content. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Instead, the model, prompt, and disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task are far more predictive of LLM agreement. Our findings suggest that when using LLMs to annotate data, under-representing the views of particular groups is not a substantial concern. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Our study bridges this debate by providing the first empirical evidence of LLM presence in the latest real-world disinformation datasets, documenting the increase of machine-generated content following ChatGPT's release, and revealing crucial patterns across languages, platforms, and time periods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Have LLMs Reopened the Pandora's Box of AI-Generated Fake News?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19250v2)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.19250v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-generated content spewed at scale from large language models (LLMs), genuine concerns about the spread of fake news have intensified. The perceived ability of LLMs to produce convincing fake news at scale poses new challenges for both human and automated fake news detection systems. To address this gap, this paper presents the findings from a university-level competition that aimed to explore how LLMs can be used by humans to create fake news, and to assess the ability of human annotators and AI models to detect it. A total of 110 participants used LLMs to create 252 unique fake news stories, and 84 annotators participated in the detection tasks. Our findings indicate that LLMs are ~68% more effective at detecting real news than humans. However, for fake news detection, the performance of LLMs and humans remains comparable (~60% accuracy). Additionally, we examine the impact of visual elements (e.g., pictures) in news on the accuracy of detecting fake news stories. Finally, we also examine various strategies used by fake news creators to enhance the credibility of their AI-generated content. This work highlights the increasing complexity of detecting AI-generated fake news, particularly in collaborative human-AI settings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing work fails to address the complexities of audio-visual scenarios, underscoring the need for further research. In this paper, we introduce AURELIA, a novel actor-critic based audio-visual (AV) reasoning framework that distills structured, step-by-step reasoning into AVLLMs at test time, improving their ability to process complex multi-modal inputs without additional training or fine-tuning. To further advance AVLLM reasoning skills, we present AVReasonBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 4500 audio-visual questions, each paired with detailed step-by-step reasoning. Our benchmark spans six distinct tasks, including AV-GeoIQ, which evaluates AV reasoning combined with geographical and cultural knowledge. Evaluating 18 AVLLMs on AVReasonBench reveals significant limitations in their multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Using AURELIA, we achieve up to a 100% relative improvement, demonstrating its effectiveness. This performance gain highlights the potential of reasoning-enhanced data generation for advancing AVLLMs in real-world applications. Our code and data will be publicly released at: https: //github.com/schowdhury671/aurelia.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we explore the potential of state of the art multi-modal (reasoning) large language models (LLMs) for deepfake image detection such as (OpenAI O1/4o, Gemini thinking Flash 2, Deepseek Janus, Grok 3, llama 3.2, Qwen 2/2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, Claude 3.5/3.7 sonnet) . We benchmark 12 latest multi-modal LLMs against traditional deepfake detection methods across multiple datasets, including recently published real-world deepfake imagery. To enhance performance, we employ prompt tuning and conduct an in-depth analysis of the models' reasoning pathways to identify key contributing factors in their decision-making process. Our findings indicate that best multi-modal LLMs achieve competitive performance with promising generalization ability with zero shot, even surpass traditional deepfake detection pipelines in out-of-distribution datasets while the rest of the LLM families performs extremely disappointing with some worse than random guess. Furthermore, we found newer model version and reasoning capabilities does not contribute to performance in such niche tasks of deepfake detection while model size do help in some cases. This study highlights the potential of integrating multi-modal reasoning in future deepfake detection frameworks and provides insights into model interpretability for robustness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPLE (TEMporal Preference Learning), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and "Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPLE as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lscpku/TEMPLE.</p></details> |  |

However, despite these achievements, current evaluations are mostly limited to specific mathematical topics, and it remains unclear whether LLMs are genuinely engaging in reasoning. To address these gaps, we present the Mathematical Topics Tree (MaTT) benchmark, a challenging and structured benchmark that offers 1,958 questions across a wide array of mathematical subjects, each paired with a detailed hierarchical chain of topics. Upon assessing different LLMs using the MaTT benchmark, we find that the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieved a mere 54\% accuracy in a multiple-choice scenario. Interestingly, even when employing Chain-of-Thought prompting, we observe mostly no notable improvement. Moreover, LLMs accuracy dramatically reduced by up to 24.2 percentage point when the questions were presented without providing choices. Further detailed analysis of the LLMs' performance across a range of topics showed significant discrepancy even for closely related subtopics within the same general mathematical area. In an effort to pinpoint the reasons behind LLMs performances, we conducted a manual evaluation of the completeness and correctness of the explanations generated by GPT-4 when choices were available. Surprisingly, we find that in only 53.3\% of the instances where the model provided a correct answer, the accompanying explanations were deemed complete and accurate, i.e., the model engaged in genuine reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the problem of minimizing the age of information (AoI) in UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks by optimizing the UAV flight routing. We formulate the AoI minimization task and propose a large language model (LLM)-assisted UAV routing algorithm (LAURA). LAURA employs an LLM as intelligent crossover operators within an evolutionary optimization framework to efficiently explore the solution space. Simulation results show that LAURA outperforms benchmark methods in reducing the maximum AoI, especially in scenarios with a large number of sensor nodes.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the scarcity of high-quality text-music paired data, this paper introduces a dual-source data acquisition approach combining online scraping and LLM-based prompting, where carefully designed prompts leverage LLMs' comprehensive music knowledge to generate contextually rich descriptions. Exten1sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks through objective metrics, subjective evaluations, and real-world A/B testing on the Huawei Music streaming platform.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |
| **[Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online Recommender systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13362v4)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.13362v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) recommender systems often rely on static datasets that fail to capture the fluid, ever changing nature of user preferences in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, generative AI techniques have emerged as powerful tools for creating synthetic data, including user profiles and behaviors. Recognizing this potential, we introduce Lusifer, an LLM-based simulation environment designed to generate dynamic, realistic user feedback for RL-based recommender training. In Lusifer, user profiles are incrementally updated at each interaction step, with Large Language Models (LLMs) providing transparent explanations of how and why preferences evolve. We focus on the MovieLens dataset, extracting only the last 40 interactions for each user, to emphasize recent behavior. By processing textual metadata (such as movie overviews and tags) Lusifer creates more context aware user states and simulates feedback on new items, including those with limited or no prior ratings. This approach reduces reliance on extensive historical data and facilitates cold start scenario handling and adaptation to out of distribution cases. Our experiments compare Lusifer with traditional collaborative filtering models, revealing that while Lusifer can be comparable in predictive accuracy, it excels at capturing dynamic user responses and yielding explainable results at every step. These qualities highlight its potential as a scalable, ethically sound alternative to live user experiments, supporting iterative and user-centric evaluations of RL-based recommender strategies. Looking ahead, we envision Lusifer serving as a foundational tool for exploring generative AI-driven user simulations, enabling more adaptive and personalized recommendation pipelines under real world constraints.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks with independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may encounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or execution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework with an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific information or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending requests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to enable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests. Additionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a concise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask, to assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests. We evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and multi-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, when assessing the outputs from mutlilingual LLMs, prior works often employed LLM based evaluators that excel at assessing English outputs, without a thorough examination of whether these evaluators could effectively assess non-English text as well. Moreover, existing benchmarks to test evaluator LLMs (referred to as "meta-evaluation benchmarks") are mostly English-centric. To bridge this gap and examine whether evaluator LLMs can reliably assess the outputs of multilingual LLMs, we introduce MM-Eval, a multilingual meta-evaluation benchmark comprising five core subsets covering 18 languages and a Language Consistency subset spanning 122 languages. A core attribute of MM-Eval is that, instead of merely translating existing English meta-evaluation benchmarks, it is designed with multilingual-specific challenges in mind. Additionally, unlike existing meta-evaluation benchmarks that focus solely on ranking accuracy over pairwise data, MM-Eval also evaluates the consistency and fairness of absolute score values across a wide range of languages. Our results show that existing evaluator LLMs that excel in English contexts have considerable room for improvement when assessing non-English outputs. Furthermore, we find that evaluators are unfair and inconsistent when evaluating lower-resourced languages. Finally, we validate MM-Eval by measuring its correlation with Best-of-N rankings, finding a significantly stronger correlation compared to other meta-evaluation benchmarks. We publicly release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, current methods face challenges: knowledge graph construction is limited by complex terminology, data heterogeneity, and rapid knowledge evolution, while LLMs show limitations in retrieval and reasoning, making it difficult to uncover cross-document associations and reasoning pathways. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline that uses LLMs to construct a biomedical knowledge graph (BioStrataKG) from large-scale articles and builds a cross-document question-answering dataset (BioCDQA) to evaluate latent knowledge retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. We then introduce Integrated and Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (IP-RAR) to enhance retrieval accuracy and knowledge reasoning. IP-RAR maximizes information recall through Integrated Reasoning-based Retrieval and refines knowledge via Progressive Reasoning-based Generation, using self-reflection to achieve deep thinking and precise contextual understanding. Experiments show that IP-RAR improves document retrieval F1 score by 20\% and answer generation accuracy by 25\% over existing methods. This framework helps doctors efficiently integrate treatment evidence for personalized medication plans and enables researchers to analyze advancements and research gaps, accelerating scientific discovery and decision-making.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs face the issue of hallucinations, generating responses that may be unreliable when the models lack relevant knowledge. To be aware of potential hallucinations, uncertainty estimation methods have been introduced, and most of them have confirmed that reliability lies in critical tokens. However, probability-based methods perform poorly in identifying token reliability, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we reveal that the probability-based method fails to estimate token reliability due to the loss of evidence strength information which is accumulated in the training stage. Therefore, we present Logits-induced token uncertainty (LogTokU), a framework for estimating decoupled token uncertainty in LLMs, enabling real-time uncertainty estimation without requiring multiple sampling processes. We employ evidence modeling to implement LogTokU and use the estimated uncertainty to guide downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that LogTokU has significant effectiveness and promise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some data errors in Table 1</p></details> |

Existing statistical and deep learning-based methods suffer from limited learnable parameters and small-scale training data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) combining time series with textual prompts have achieved promising performance in MTSF. However, we discovered that current LLM-based solutions fall short in learning disentangled embeddings. We introduce TimeCMA, an intuitive yet effective framework for MTSF via cross-modality alignment. Specifically, we present a dual-modality encoding with two branches: the time series encoding branch extracts disentangled yet weak time series embeddings, and the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series with text as prompts to obtain entangled yet robust prompt embeddings. As a result, such a cross-modality alignment retrieves both disentangled and robust time series embeddings, "the best of two worlds", from the prompt embeddings based on time series and prompt modality similarities. As another key design, to reduce the computational costs from time series with their length textual prompts, we design an effective prompt to encourage the most essential temporal information to be encapsulated in the last token: only the last token is passed to downstream prediction. We further store the last token embeddings to accelerate inference speed. Extensive experiments on eight real datasets demonstrate that TimeCMA outperforms state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at AAAI 2025 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

Standard alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), often rely on the binary Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which can struggle to capture the complexities of human preferences -- particularly in the presence of noisy or inconsistent labels and frequent ties. To address these limitations, we introduce the Tie-rank Oriented Bradley-Terry model (TOBT), an extension of the BT model that explicitly incorporates ties, enabling more nuanced preference representation. Building on this, we propose Tie-rank Oriented Direct Preference Optimization (TODO), a novel alignment algorithm that leverages TOBT's ternary ranking system to improve preference alignment. In evaluations on Mistral-7B and Llama 3-8B models, TODO consistently outperforms DPO in modeling preferences across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Additional assessments using MT Bench and benchmarks such as Piqa, ARC-c, and MMLU further demonstrate TODO's superior alignment performance. Notably, TODO also shows strong results in binary preference alignment, highlighting its versatility and potential for broader integration into LLM alignment.

This issue is particularly evident in treatment mapping, where coding systems such as ICD, Mondo, and ATC lack comprehensive coverage, resulting in missing or inconsistent associations between diseases and their potential treatments. To address this issue, we have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imputing missing treatment relationships. Although LLMs offer promising capabilities in knowledge augmentation, their application in medical knowledge imputation presents significant risks, including factual inaccuracies, hallucinated associations, and instability between and within LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate LLM-driven treatment mapping, assessing its reliability through benchmark comparisons. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including inconsistencies with established clinical guidelines and potential risks to patient safety. This study serves as a cautionary guide for researchers and practitioners, underscoring the importance of critical evaluation and hybrid approaches when leveraging LLMs to enhance treatment mappings on medical knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, AMIA</p></details> |

However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring internal access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.</p></details> |  |

This approach can significantly reduce costs without impacting performance. However, risk-sensitive domains such as finance or medicine place an additional premium on avoiding model errors. Since even the most expensive models are susceptible to making mistakes, applications in these domains benefit from allowing LLM systems to completely abstain from answering difficult queries. Introducing abstention poses a design question for LLM cascades: should abstention only be allowed at the final model or also at earlier models? Since the error patterns of small and large models are correlated, allowing earlier models to abstain may reduce inference costs and latency by anticipating abstention decisions by expensive and slow models, thus avoiding the need to run these models. We investigate the benefits of such "early abstention" in LLM cascades and find that it reduces overall test loss by 2.2% on average across six benchmarks (GSM8K, MedMCQA, MMLU, TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and XSum). These gains result from a more effective use of abstention, trading a 4.1% average increase in the overall abstention rate for a 13.0% reduction in cost and a 5.0% reduction in error rate. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of leveraging correlations between the error patterns of different language models to drive performance improvements for LLM systems with abstention.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios. Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.</p></details> |  |

To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</p></details> |  |

However, past work has largely assumed that tasks are well-defined. In the real world, queries to LLMs are often underspecified, only solvable through acquiring missing information. We formalize this as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with missing variable assignments. Using a special case of this formalism where only one necessary variable assignment is missing, we can rigorously evaluate an LLM's ability to identify the minimal necessary question to ask and quantify axes of difficulty levels for each problem. We present QuestBench, a set of underspecified reasoning tasks solvable by asking at most one question, which includes: (1) Logic-Q: Logical reasoning tasks with one missing proposition, (2) Planning-Q: PDDL planning problems with initial states that are partially-observed, (3) GSM-Q: Human-annotated grade school math problems with one missing variable assignment, and (4) GSME-Q: a version of GSM-Q where word problems are translated into equations by human annotators. The LLM is tasked with selecting the correct clarification question(s) from a list of options. While state-of-the-art models excel at GSM-Q and GSME-Q, their accuracy is only 40-50% on Logic-Q and Planning-Q. Analysis demonstrates that the ability to solve well-specified reasoning problems may not be sufficient for success on our benchmark: models have difficulty identifying the right question to ask, even when they can solve the fully specified version of the problem. Furthermore, in the Planning-Q domain, LLMs tend not to hedge, even when explicitly presented with the option to predict ``not sure.'' This highlights the need for deeper investigation into models' information acquisition capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/google-deepmind/questbench}</p></details> |

As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized knowledge. In this work, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire scenarios. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating domain-specific projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through a RAG framework, the system ensures both accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based solutions for decision support in natural hazard and extreme weather contexts.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, the creation of these models has been a manual process requiring not only deep modeling expertise but also substantial domain knowledge of target systems. With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) show potential for automating model generation. This work explores the generation of instance models using LLMs, focusing specifically on producing XMI-based instance models from Ecore metamodels and natural language specifications. We observe that current LLMs struggle to directly generate valid XMI models. To address this, we propose a two-step approach: first, using LLMs to produce a simplified structured output containing all necessary instance model information, namely a conceptual instance model, and then compiling this intermediate representation into a valid XMI file. The conceptual instance model is format-independent, allowing it to be transformed into various modeling formats via different compilers. The feasibility of the proposed method has been demonstrated using several LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1-preview, Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B). Results show that the proposed method significantly improves the usability of LLMs for instance model generation tasks. Notably, the smaller open-source model, Llama 3.1 70B, demonstrated performance comparable to proprietary GPT models within the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLM serving frameworks rely on siloed infrastructure with coarse-grained workload segregation -- interactive and batch -- leading to inefficient resource utilization and limited support for fine-grained Quality-of-Service (QoS) differentiation. This results in operational inefficiencies, over-provisioning and poor load management during traffic surges. We present Niyama, a novel QoS-driven inference serving system that enables efficient co-scheduling of diverse workloads on shared infrastructure. Niyama introduces fine-grained QoS classification allowing applications to specify precise latency requirements, and dynamically adapts scheduling decisions based on real-time system state. Leveraging the predictable execution characteristics of LLM inference, Niyama implements a dynamic chunking mechanism to improve overall throughput while maintaining strict QoS guarantees. Additionally, Niyama employs a hybrid prioritization policy that balances fairness and efficiency, and employs selective request relegation that enables graceful service degradation during overload conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates that Niyama increases serving capacity by 32% compared to current siloed deployments, while maintaining QoS guarantees. Notably, under extreme load, our system reduces SLO violations by an order of magnitude compared to current strategies.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have shown significant limitations in LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, raising concerns about their reliability in high-stakes applications. Accurately estimating LLMs' uncertainty in adhering to instructions is critical to mitigating deployment risks. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic evaluation of the uncertainty estimation abilities of LLMs in the context of instruction-following. Our study identifies key challenges with existing instruction-following benchmarks, where multiple factors are entangled with uncertainty stems from instruction-following, complicating the isolation and comparison across methods and models. To address these issues, we introduce a controlled evaluation setup with two benchmark versions of data, enabling a comprehensive comparison of uncertainty estimation methods under various conditions. Our findings show that existing uncertainty methods struggle, particularly when models make subtle errors in instruction following. While internal model states provide some improvement, they remain inadequate in more complex scenarios. The insights from our controlled evaluation setups provide a crucial understanding of LLMs' limitations and potential for uncertainty estimation in instruction-following tasks, paving the way for more trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs often fail to follow even simple and clear instructions. To improve instruction-following behavior and prevent undesirable outputs, a deeper understanding of how LLMs' internal states relate to these outcomes is required. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs encode information in their representations that correlate with instruction-following success - a property we term knowing internally. Our analysis identifies a direction in the input embedding space, termed the instruction-following dimension, that predicts whether a response will comply with a given instruction. We find that this dimension generalizes well across unseen tasks but not across unseen instruction types. We demonstrate that modifying representations along this dimension improves instruction-following success rates compared to random changes, without compromising response quality. Further investigation reveals that this dimension is more closely related to the phrasing of prompts rather than the inherent difficulty of the task or instructions. This work provides insight into the internal workings of LLMs' instruction-following, paving the way for reliable LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines, far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture, and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert the human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Using a PRISMA-inspired framework, we systematically reviewed nearly 250 scholarly sources, capturing the state of the art from various venues of publication, and establishing a solid foundation for our analysis. Our study offers a structured approach by developing two interrelated taxonomy systems: one that defines \emph{what to evaluate} and another that explains \emph{how to evaluate}. The first taxonomy identifies key components of LLM-based agents for multi-turn conversations and their evaluation dimensions, including task completion, response quality, user experience, memory and context retention, as well as planning and tool integration. These components ensure that the performance of conversational agents is assessed in a holistic and meaningful manner. The second taxonomy system focuses on the evaluation methodologies. It categorizes approaches into annotation-based evaluations, automated metrics, hybrid strategies that combine human assessments with quantitative measures, and self-judging methods utilizing LLMs. This framework not only captures traditional metrics derived from language understanding, such as BLEU and ROUGE scores, but also incorporates advanced techniques that reflect the dynamic, interactive nature of multi-turn dialogues.</p></details> |  |

Issue localization forms the basis for accurate patch generation. However, because of limitations caused by the context window length of LLMs, existing issue localization methods face challenges in balancing concise yet effective contexts and adequately comprehensive search spaces. In this paper, we introduce CoSIL, an LLM driven, simple yet powerful function level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL reduces the search space through module call graphs, iteratively searches the function call graph to obtain relevant contexts, and uses context pruning to control the search direction and manage contexts effectively. Importantly, the call graph is dynamically constructed by the LLM during search, eliminating the need for pre-parsing. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization success rate of 43 percent and 44.6 percent on SWE bench Lite and SWE bench Verified, respectively, using Qwen2.5 Coder 32B, outperforming existing methods by 8.6 to 98.2 percent. When CoSIL is applied to guide the patch generation stage, the resolved rate further improves by 9.3 to 31.5 percent.</p></details> |  |

Entity Frequency in Pre-training Induces Asymmetry in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22362v1)** | 2025-03-28 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.22362v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring reliable content generation. While previous research has primarily focused on "when" LLMs hallucinate, our work explains "why" and directly links model behaviour to the pre-training data that forms their prior knowledge. Specifically, we demonstrate that an asymmetry exists in the recognition of logically equivalent facts, which can be attributed to frequency discrepancies of entities appearing as subjects versus objects. Given that most pre-training datasets are inaccessible, we leverage the fully open-source OLMo series by indexing its Dolma dataset to estimate entity frequencies. Using relational facts (represented as triples) from Wikidata5M, we construct probing datasets to isolate this effect. Our experiments reveal that facts with a high-frequency subject and a low-frequency object are better recognised than their inverse, despite their logical equivalence. The pattern reverses in low-to-high frequency settings, and no statistically significant asymmetry emerges when both entities are high-frequency. These findings highlight the influential role of pre-training data in shaping model predictions and provide insights for inferring the characteristics of pre-training data in closed or partially closed LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing analyses are limited in scope, and generalizability across architectures is unclear. This paper helps address some of these gaps by conducting an analysis of massive activations across a broad range of LLMs, including both GLU-based and non-GLU-based architectures. Our findings challenge several prior assumptions, most importantly: (1) not all massive activations are detrimental, i.e. suppressing them does not lead to an explosion of perplexity or a collapse in downstream task performance; (2) proposed mitigation strategies such as Attention KV bias are model-specific and ineffective in certain cases. We consequently investigate novel hybrid mitigation strategies; in particular pairing Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) with Attention KV bias or Dynamic Tanh (DyT) successfully balances the mitigation of massive activations with preserved downstream model performance in the scenarios we investigated.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this study proposes the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate authentic patient communication styles, specifically the "accuser" and "rationalizer" personas derived from the Satir model, while also ensuring multilingual applicability to accommodate diverse cultural contexts and enhance accessibility for medical professionals. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and stubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody nuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated these VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \pm 1.0$; rationalizer: $3.7 \pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly identifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the accuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed contemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient description including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero to nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with the accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral ($4.0 \pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate complex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical education. This approach equips trainees to navigate challenging clinical scenarios by providing realistic, adaptable patient interactions, enhancing empathy and diagnostic acumen. Our findings advocate for AI-driven tools as scalable, cost-effective solutions to cultivate nuanced communication skills, setting a foundation for future innovations in healthcare training.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs offer benefits such as enhanced learning experiences, automated assessments, and personalized tutoring, their integration also raises concerns about academic integrity, student over-reliance, and ethical considerations. In this study, we conducted a preliminary literature review to identify motivators and demotivators for using LLMs in software engineering education. We applied a thematic mapping process to categorize and structure these factors (motivators and demotivators), offering a comprehensive view of their impact. In total, we identified 25 motivators and 30 demotivators, which are further organized into four high-level themes. This mapping provides a structured framework for understanding the factors that influence the integration of LLMs in software engineering education, both positively and negatively. As part of a larger research project, this study serves as a feasibility assessment, laying the groundwork for future systematic literature review and empirical studies. Ultimately, this project aims to develop a framework to assist Finnish higher education institutions in effectively integrating LLMs into software engineering education while addressing potential risks and challenges.</p></details> |  |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-quality labeled nodes in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) is challenging and costly due to their complex textual and structural characteristics. Large language models (LLMs), known for their powerful zero-shot capabilities in textual tasks, show promise but struggle to naturally capture the critical structural information inherent to TAGs, limiting their direct effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-GOOD, a general framework that effectively combines the strengths of LLMs and GNNs to enhance data efficiency in graph OOD detection. Specifically, we first leverage LLMs' strong zero-shot capabilities to filter out likely OOD nodes, significantly reducing the human annotation burden. To minimize the usage and cost of the LLM, we employ it only to annotate a small subset of unlabeled nodes. We then train a lightweight GNN filter using these noisy labels, enabling efficient predictions of ID status for all other unlabeled nodes by leveraging both textual and structural information. After obtaining node embeddings from the GNN filter, we can apply informativeness-based methods to select the most valuable nodes for precise human annotation. Finally, we train the target ID classifier using these accurately annotated ID nodes. Extensive experiments on four real-world TAG datasets demonstrate that LLM-GOOD significantly reduces human annotation costs and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance.</p></details> |  |

Even when links exist, diagnosis lists may be incomplete, especially during early patient visits. Discharge summaries tend to provide more complete information, which can help infer accurate diagnoses, especially with the help of large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether LLMs can predict implicitly mentioned diagnoses from clinical notes and link them to corresponding medications. We address two research questions: (1) Does majority voting across diverse LLM configurations outperform the best single configuration in diagnosis prediction? (2) How sensitive is majority voting accuracy to LLM hyperparameters such as temperature, top-p, and summary length? To evaluate, we created a new dataset of 240 expert-annotated medication-diagnosis pairs from 20 MIMIC-IV notes. Using GPT-3.5 Turbo, we ran 18 prompting configurations across short and long summary lengths, generating 8568 test cases. Results show that majority voting achieved 75 percent accuracy, outperforming the best single configuration at 66 percent. No single hyperparameter setting dominated, but combining deterministic, balanced, and exploratory strategies improved performance. Shorter summaries generally led to higher accuracy.In conclusion, ensemble-style majority voting with diverse LLM configurations improves diagnosis prediction in EHRs and offers a promising method to link medications and diagnoses in clinical texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

A key challenge is jailbreak, where adversarial prompts bypass built-in safeguards to elicit harmful disallowed outputs. Inspired by psychological foot-in-the-door principles, we introduce FITD,a novel multi-turn jailbreak method that leverages the phenomenon where minor initial commitments lower resistance to more significant or more unethical transgressions. Our approach progressively escalates the malicious intent of user queries through intermediate bridge prompts and aligns the model's response by itself to induce toxic responses. Extensive experimental results on two jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that FITD achieves an average attack success rate of 94% across seven widely used models, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of LLM self-corruption, highlighting vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies and emphasizing the risks inherent in multi-turn interactions.

Attackers constantly refine their methods, making phishing emails harder to detect. Traditional detection methods, including rule-based systems and supervised machine learning models, either rely on predefined patterns like blacklists, which can be bypassed with slight modifications, or require large datasets for training and still can generate false positives and false negatives. In this work, we propose a multi-agent large language model (LLM) prompting technique that simulates debates among agents to detect whether the content presented on an email is phishing. Our approach uses two LLM agents to present arguments for or against the classification task, with a judge agent adjudicating the final verdict based on the quality of reasoning provided. This debate mechanism enables the models to critically analyze contextual cue and deceptive patterns in text, which leads to improved classification accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on multiple phishing email datasets and demonstrate that mixed-agent configurations consistently outperform homogeneous configurations. Results also show that the debate structure itself is sufficient to yield accurate decisions without extra prompting strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 13th International Symposium on Digital Forensics and Security (ISDFS 2025)</p></details> |

To this end, we leverage domain-specific ontologies by enriching them with LLM-generated data and pretraining the encoder model as an ontology-informed embedding model for concept definitions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method, we compile a benchmark specifically designed for assessing model performance in invasion biology. After demonstrating substantial improvements over standard LLM pretraining, we investigate the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to domains without comprehensive ontologies by substituting ontological concepts with concepts automatically extracted from a small corpus of scientific abstracts and establishing relationships between concepts through distributional statistics. Our results demonstrate that this automated approach achieves comparable performance using only a small set of scientific abstracts, resulting in a fully automated pipeline for enhancing domain-specific understanding of small encoder models that is especially suited for application in low-resource settings and achieves performance comparable to masked language modeling pretraining on much larger datasets.</p></details> |  |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Anima-Lab/DiffStateGrad.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

In this work, we propose a new framework, namely InstructRestore, to perform region-adjustable image restoration following human instructions. To achieve this, we first develop a data generation engine to produce training triplets, each consisting of a high-quality image, the target region description, and the corresponding region mask. With this engine and careful data screening, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 536,945 triplets to support the training and evaluation of this task. We then examine how to integrate the low-quality image features under the ControlNet architecture to adjust the degree of image details enhancement. Consequently, we develop a ControlNet-like model to identify the target region and allocate different integration scales to the target and surrounding regions, enabling region-customized image restoration that aligns with user instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed InstructRestore approach enables effective human-instructed image restoration, such as images with bokeh effects and user-instructed local enhancement. Our work advances the investigation of interactive image restoration and enhancement techniques. Data, code, and models will be found at https://github.com/shuaizhengliu/InstructRestore.git.</p></details> |  |

Given the iterative refinement nature of diffusion models, most existing approaches are computationally expensive. While methods such as SinSR and OSEDiff have emerged to condense inference steps via distillation, their performance in image restoration or details recovery is not satisfied. To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration. Secondly, we propose a Distribution-Aware Sampling Module to make detail-oriented gradients more readily accessible, addressing the challenge of recovering fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TSD-SR has superior restoration results (most of the metrics perform the best) and the fastest inference speed (e.g. 40 times faster than SeeSR) compared to the past Real-ISR approaches based on pre-trained diffusion priors.</p></details> |  |

To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the Regularization by Denoising principle, we introduce an approach that integrates a Latent Diffusion Model, trained for the denoising task, into a variational framework using Half-Quadratic Splitting, exploiting its regularization properties. This approach, under appropriate conditions that can be easily met in various imaging applications, allows for reduced computational cost while achieving high-quality results. The proposed strategy, called Regularization by Latent Denoising (RELD), is then tested on a dataset of natural images, for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. The numerical experiments show that RELD is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving remarkable results when evaluated using perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, deploying SSMs to edge devices is challenging due to the constraints in memory, computing capacity, and power consumption, underscoring the need for efficient compression strategies. While low-bit quantization is an efficient model compression strategy for reducing size and accelerating IR tasks, SSM suffers substantial performance drops at ultra-low bit-widths (2-4 bits), primarily due to outliers that exacerbate quantization error. To address this challenge, we propose Q-MambaIR, an accurate, efficient, and flexible Quantized Mamba for IR tasks. Specifically, we introduce a Statistical Dynamic-balancing Learnable Scalar (DLS) to dynamically adjust the quantization mapping range, thereby mitigating the peak truncation loss caused by extreme values. Furthermore, we design a Range-floating Flexible Allocator (RFA) with an adaptive threshold to flexibly round values. This approach preserves high-frequency details and maintains the SSM's feature extraction capability. Notably, RFA also enables pre-deployment weight quantization, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy. Extensive experiments on IR tasks demonstrate that Q-MambaIR consistently outperforms existing quantized SSMs, achieving much higher state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy results with only a negligible increase in training computation and storage saving.</p></details> |  |

Pre-trained diffusion models have been very successfully used as image priors in zero-shot image restoration methods. However, how to best handle the degradation operator is still an open problem. In real-world data, methods that rely on specific parametric assumptions about the degradation model often face limitations in their applicability. To address this, we introduce Invert2Restore, a zero-shot, training-free method that operates in both fully blind and partially blind settings -- requiring no prior knowledge of the degradation model or only partial knowledge of its parametric form without known parameters. Despite this, Invert2Restore achieves high-fidelity results and generalizes well across various types of image degradation. It leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as a deterministic mapping between normal samples and undistorted image samples. The key insight is that the input noise mapped by a diffusion model to a degraded image lies in a low-probability density region of the standard normal distribution. Thus, we can restore the degraded image by carefully guiding its input noise toward a higher-density region. We experimentally validate Invert2Restore across several image restoration tasks, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in scenarios where the degradation operator is either unknown or partially known.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Image Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21410v1)** | 2025-03-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.21410v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot image restoration (IR) methods based on pretrained diffusion models have recently achieved significant success. These methods typically require at least a parametric form of the degradation model. However, in real-world scenarios, the degradation may be too complex to define explicitly. To handle this general case, we introduce the Diffusion Image Prior (DIIP). We take inspiration from the Deep Image Prior (DIP)[16], since it can be used to remove artifacts without the need for an explicit degradation model. However, in contrast to DIP, we find that pretrained diffusion models offer a much stronger prior, despite being trained without knowledge from corrupted data. We show that, the optimization process in DIIP first reconstructs a clean version of the image before eventually overfitting to the degraded input, but it does so for a broader range of degradations than DIP. In light of this result, we propose a blind image restoration (IR) method based on early stopping, which does not require prior knowledge of the degradation model. We validate DIIP on various degradation-blind IR tasks, including JPEG artifact removal, waterdrop removal, denoising and super-resolution with state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In MHA, heads perform attention calculation independently from uniform split subspaces, and a redundancy issue is triggered to hinder the model from achieving satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by exploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads, which results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model, termed HINT, for image restoration. HINT contains two modules, i.e., the Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention (HMHA) and the Query-Key Cache Updating (QKCU) module, to address the redundancy problem that is rooted in vanilla MHA. Specifically, HMHA extracts diverse contextual features by employing heads to learn from subspaces of varying sizes and containing different information. Moreover, QKCU, comprising intra- and inter-layer schemes, further reduces the redundancy problem by facilitating enhanced interactions between attention heads within and across layers. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 benchmarks across 5 image restoration tasks, including low-light enhancement, dehazing, desnowing, denoising, and deraining, to demonstrate the superiority of HINT.

While image diffusion models have shown remarkable restoration capabilities, their direct application to video leads to temporal inconsistencies, and existing video restoration methods require extensive retraining for different degradation types. Our approach addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a hierarchical latent warping strategy that maintains consistency across both keyframes and local frames, and a hybrid token merging mechanism that adaptively combines optical flow and feature matching. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains the high-quality restoration of base diffusion models but also achieves superior temporal consistency across diverse datasets and degradation conditions, including challenging scenarios like 8$\times$ super-resolution and severe noise. Importantly, our framework works with any image restoration diffusion model, providing a versatile solution for video enhancement without task-specific training or modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jimmycv07.github.io/DiffIR2VR_web/</p></details> |

Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

In this paper, we propose Fractal-IR, a fractal-based design that progressively refines degraded images by repeatedly expanding local information into broader regions. This fractal architecture naturally captures local details at early stages and seamlessly transitions toward global context in deeper fractal stages, removing the need for computationally heavy long-range self-attention mechanisms. Moveover, we observe the challenge in scaling up vision transformers for IR tasks. Through a series of analyses, we identify a holistic set of strategies to effectively guide model scaling. Extensive experimental results show that Fractal-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, denoising, JPEG artifact removal, IR in adverse weather conditions, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and demosaicking. For $2\times$ SR on Manga109, Fractal-IR achieves a 0.21 dB PSNR gain. For grayscale image denoising on Urban100, Fractal-IR surpasses the previous method by 0.2 dB for $\sigma=50$.</p></details> |  |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing.

In this paper, we introduce the Implicit Image-to-Image Schr\"odinger Bridge (I$^3$SB) to further accelerate the generative process of I$^2$SB. I$^3$SB restructures the generative process into a non-Markovian framework by incorporating the initial corrupted image at each generative step, effectively preserving and utilizing its information. To enable direct use of pretrained I$^2$SB models without additional training, we ensure consistency in marginal distributions. Extensive experiments across many image corruptions, including noise, low resolution, JPEG compression, and sparse sampling, and multiple image modalities, such as natural, human face, and medical images, demonstrate the acceleration benefits of I$^3$SB. Compared to I$^2$SB, I$^3$SB achieves the same perceptual quality with fewer generative steps, while maintaining or improving fidelity to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, most existing methods address only a single type of degradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world applicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of handling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion model. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues extracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world image restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a mixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of specific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe. Additionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark containing images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive evaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark, demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can robustly restore images with severe degradations.

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.</p></details> |  |

Existing Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) offer stable restoration performance but require manual selection of degradation matrices for each degradation type, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this issue, we propose the Vision-Language-guided Unfolding Network (VLU-Net), a unified DUN framework for handling multiple degradation types simultaneously. VLU-Net leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) refined on degraded image-text pairs to align image features with degradation descriptions, selecting the appropriate transform for target degradation. By integrating an automatic VLM-based gradient estimation strategy into the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm, VLU-Net effectively tackles complex multi-degradation restoration tasks while maintaining interpretability. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical feature unfolding structure to enhance VLU-Net framework, efficiently synthesizing degradation patterns across various levels. VLU-Net is the first all-in-one DUN framework and outperforms current leading one-by-one and all-in-one end-to-end methods by 3.74 dB on the SOTS dehazing dataset and 1.70 dB on the Rain100L deraining dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we tackle image restoration from a different perspective by jointly denoising multiple photographs of the same scene. Our core hypothesis is that degraded images capturing a shared scene contain complementary information that, when combined, better constrains the restoration problem. To this end, we implement a powerful multi-view diffusion model that jointly generates uncorrupted views by extracting rich information from multi-view relationships. Our experiments show that our multi-view approach outperforms existing single-view image and even video-based methods on image deblurring and super-resolution tasks. Critically, our model is trained to output 3D consistent images, making it a promising tool for applications requiring robust multi-view integration, such as 3D reconstruction or pose estimation.</p></details> |  |

The structure of the perturbations is investigated depending on the acceptable PSNR values and based on the Fourier power spectrum computations for the perturbations. It is demonstrated that moderate variation of image brightness ($\sim 10$ pixel units in a restricted region of an image can result in VMAF growth by $\sim 60\%$). Unlike some other methods demonstrating similar VMAF growth, the subjective quality of an image remains almost unchanged. It is also shown that the adversarial perturbations may demonstrate approximately linear dependence of perturbation amplitudes on the image brightness. The perturbations are studied based on the direct VMAF optimization in PyTorch. The significant discrepancies between the metric values and subjective judgements are also demonstrated when image restoration from noise is carried out using the same direct VMAF optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 40 figures |

Specifically, PPTformer contains two parts: an Image Restoration Network (IRNet) for restoring images from degraded observations and a Parser-Prompted Feature Generation Network (PPFGNet) for providing IRNet with reliable parser information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter Parser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception of the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the InterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser, followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted feed-forward network to guide restoration within pixel-wise gating modulation. Experimental results show that PPTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image deraining, defocus deblurring, desnowing, and low-light enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is accepted by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

However, rapid scans often result in poor image quality, potentially affecting diagnosis due to reduced resolution and detail, which make it challenging to identify and evaluate finer anatomical structures. To address this issue, we propose the first application of SAM-based semantic priors for medical image restoration, leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance rapid bone scintigraphy images in pediatric populations. Our method comprises two cascaded networks, $f^{IR1}$ and $f^{IR2}$, augmented by three key modules: a Semantic Prior Integration (SPI) module, a Semantic Knowledge Distillation (SKD) module, and a Semantic Consistency Module (SCM). The SPI and SKD modules incorporate domain-specific semantic information from a fine-tuned SAM, while the SCM maintains consistent semantic feature representation throughout the cascaded networks. In addition, we will release a novel Rapid Bone Scintigraphy dataset called RBS, the first dataset dedicated to rapid bone scintigraphy image restoration in pediatric patients. RBS consists of 137 pediatric patients aged between 0.5 and 16 years who underwent both standard and rapid bone scans. The dataset includes scans performed at 20 cm/min (standard) and 40 cm/min (rapid), representing a $2\times$ acceleration. We conducted extensive experiments on both the publicly available endoscopic dataset and RBS.

To cope with these challenges, we analyze the restoration process in depth through a progressive spectral perspective, and deconstruct the complex UHD restoration problem into three progressive stages: zero-frequency enhancement, low-frequency restoration, and high-frequency refinement. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, ERR, which comprises three collaborative sub-networks: the zero-frequency enhancer (ZFE), the low-frequency restorer (LFR), and the high-frequency refiner (HFR). Specifically, the ZFE integrates global priors to learn global mapping, while the LFR restores low-frequency information, emphasizing reconstruction of coarse-grained content. Finally, the HFR employs our designed frequency-windowed kolmogorov-arnold networks (FW-KAN) to refine textures and details, producing high-quality image restoration. Our approach significantly outperforms previous UHD methods across various tasks, with extensive ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we introduce ABAIR, a simple yet effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration model that not only handles multiple degradations and generalizes well to unseen distortions but also efficiently integrates new degradations by training only a small subset of parameters. We first train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations. To enhance its ability to recognize distortions, we incorporate a segmentation head that estimates per-pixel degradation types. Second, we adapt our initial model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. This specialize-then-merge approach is both powerful in addressing specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks. Moreover, our model not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance on five- and three-task IR setups but also demonstrates superior generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system.

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity.

This leads to insufficient interaction for unprofessional users and limits their restoration capability for complicated real-world applications. In this work, we present HybridAgent, intending to incorporate multiple restoration modes into a unified image restoration model and achieve intelligent and efficient user interaction through our proposed hybrid agents. Concretely, we propose the hybrid rule of fast, slow, and feedback restoration agents. Here, the slow restoration agent optimizes the powerful multimodal large language model (MLLM) with our proposed instruction-tuning dataset to identify degradations within images with ambiguous user prompts and invokes proper restoration tools accordingly. The fast restoration agent is designed based on a lightweight large language model (LLM) via in-context learning to understand the user prompts with simple and clear requirements, which can obviate the unnecessary time/resource costs of MLLM. Moreover, we introduce the mixed distortion removal mode for our HybridAgents, which is crucial but not concerned in previous agent-based works. It can effectively prevent the error propagation of step-by-step image restoration and largely improve the efficiency of the agent system. We validate the effectiveness of HybridAgent with both synthetic and real-world IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, images captured by diverse sensors often encounter various degradations that can negatively affect fusion quality. Traditional fusion methods generally treat image enhancement and fusion as separate processes, overlooking the inherent correlation between them; notably, the dominant regions in one modality of a fused image often indicate areas where the other modality might benefit from enhancement. Inspired by this observation, we introduce the concept of dominant regions for image enhancement and present a Dynamic Relative EnhAnceMent framework for Image Fusion (Dream-IF). This framework quantifies the relative dominance of each modality across different layers and leverages this information to facilitate reciprocal cross-modal enhancement. By integrating the relative dominance derived from image fusion, our approach supports not only image restoration but also a broader range of image enhancement applications. Furthermore, we employ prompt-based encoding to capture degradation-specific details, which dynamically steer the restoration process and promote coordinated enhancement in both multi-modal image fusion and image enhancement scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Dream-IF consistently outperforms its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

The absence of such metrics hinders the assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (Cross-Reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new Cross-Reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate Cross-Reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose MP-HSIR, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Recent methods are inspired by prompt learning using pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), leveraging degradation-aware prompts to facilitate weather-free image restoration, yielding significant improvements. In this work, we propose CyclicPrompt, an innovative cyclic prompt approach designed to enhance the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalizability of UAWR. CyclicPrompt Comprises two key components: 1) a composite context prompt that integrates weather-related information and context-aware representations into the network to guide restoration. This prompt differs from previous methods by marrying learnable input-conditional vectors with weather-specific knowledge, thereby improving adaptability across various degradations. 2) The erase-and-paste mechanism, after the initial guided restoration, substitutes weather-specific knowledge with constrained restoration priors, inducing high-quality weather-free concepts into the composite prompt to further fine-tune the restoration process. Therefore, we can form a cyclic "Prompt-Restore-Prompt" pipeline that adeptly harnesses weather-specific knowledge, textual contexts, and reliable textures. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superior performance of CyclicPrompt. The code is available at: https://github.com/RongxinL/CyclicPrompt.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of processing high-resolution images due to the large number of parameters in classical models, along with the scalability challenges of quantum algorithms for image processing, remains a major obstacle. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Image Enhancement Transformer for Super-Resolution (QUIET-SR), a hybrid framework that extends the Swin transformer architecture with a novel shifted quantum window attention mechanism, built upon variational quantum neural networks. QUIET-SR effectively captures complex residual mappings between low-resolution and high-resolution images, leveraging quantum attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and image restoration while requiring a minimal number of qubits, making it suitable for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We evaluate our framework in MNIST (30.24 PSNR, 0.989 SSIM), FashionMNIST (29.76 PSNR, 0.976 SSIM) and the MedMNIST dataset collection, demonstrating that QUIET-SR achieves PSNR and SSIM scores comparable to state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. These findings highlight the potential of scalable variational quantum machine learning models for SISR, marking a step toward practical quantum-enhanced image super-resolution.</p></details> | 10 figures, 3 pages |

However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration across diverse degradation scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical remote sensing applications.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradation specific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms state-of-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models.

Existing all-in-one image restoration approaches struggle with addressing complex and ambiguously defined degradation types. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic degradation decomposition network for all-in-one image restoration, named D$^3$Net. D$^3$Net achieves degradation-adaptive image restoration with guided prompt through cross-domain interaction and dynamic degradation decomposition. Concretely, in D$^3$Net, the proposed Cross-Domain Degradation Analyzer (CDDA) engages in deep interaction between frequency domain degradation characteristics and spatial domain image features to identify and model variations of different degradation types on the image manifold, generating degradation correction prompt and strategy prompt, which guide the following decomposition process. Furthermore, the prompt-based Dynamic Decomposition Mechanism (DDM) for progressive degradation decomposition, that encourages the network to adaptively select restoration strategies utilizing the two-level prompt generated by CDDA. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation between CDDA and DDM, D$^3$Net achieves superior flexibility and scalability in handling unknown degradation, while effectively reducing unnecessary computational overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks demonstrate that D$^3$Net significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially improving PSNR by 5.47dB and 3.30dB on the SOTS-Outdoor and GoPro datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation reveals a critical gap: existing approaches consistently fail on severely degraded videos--precisely where diffusion models' generative capabilities are most needed. We identify that existing diffusion-based VSR methods struggle primarily because they face an overwhelming learning burden: simultaneously modeling complex degradation distributions, content representations, and temporal relationships with limited high-quality training data. To address this fundamental challenge, we present DiffVSR, featuring a Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that systematically decomposes this learning burden through staged training, enabling superior performance on complex degradations. Our framework additionally incorporates an Interweaved Latent Transition (ILT) technique that maintains competitive temporal consistency without additional training overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our approach excels in scenarios where competing methods struggle, particularly on severely degraded videos. Our work reveals that addressing the learning strategy, rather than focusing solely on architectural complexity, is the critical path toward robust real-world video super-resolution with diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xh9998.github.io/DiffVSR-project/</p></details> |

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, this enhanced contrast comes at the cost of system complexity, constrained by an inherent trade-off between spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and imaging speed. To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge. Fine-tuned using metrics aligned with the imaging model, our physics-aware method achieves a 16X pixel super-resolution enhancement and a 12X imaging speedup without the need of additional training data for transfer learning. Applied to both synthetic and experimental data from five different sample types, we demonstrate that the model preserves biological integrity, ensuring no features are lost or hallucinated. We also concretely demonstrate the model's ability to reveal disease-associated metabolic changes in Downs syndrome that would otherwise remain undetectable. Furthermore, we provide physical insights into the inner workings of the model, paving the way for future refinements that could potentially surpass instrumental limits in an explainable manner.

Approach:We propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework called Res-SRDiff, which integrates residual error shifting into the forward diffusion process. This enables efficient HR image reconstruction by aligning the degraded HR and LR distributions.We evaluated Res-SRDiff on ultra-high-field brain T1 MP2RAGE maps and T2-weighted prostate images, comparing it with Bicubic, Pix2pix, CycleGAN, and a conventional denoising diffusion probabilistic model with vision transformer backbone (TM-DDPM), using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), gradient magnitude similarity deviation (GMSD), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). Main results: Res-SRDiff significantly outperformed all comparative methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and GMSD across both datasets, with statistically significant improvements (p-values<<0.05). The model achieved high-fidelity image restoration with only four sampling steps, drastically reducing computational time to under one second per slice, which is substantially faster than conventional TM-DDPM with around 20 seconds per slice. Qualitative analyses further demonstrated that Res-SRDiff effectively preserved fine anatomical details and lesion morphology in both brain and pelvic MRI images. Significance: Our findings show that Res-SRDiff is an efficient and accurate MRI SR method, markedly improving computational efficiency and image quality. Integrating residual error shifting into the diffusion process allows for rapid and robust HR image reconstruction, enhancing clinical MRI workflows and advancing medical imaging research.

PnP methods leverage the strength of pre-trained denoisers, often deep neural networks, by integrating them in optimization schemes. While they achieve state-of-the-art performance on various inverse problems in imaging, PnP approaches face inherent limitations on more generative tasks like inpainting. On the other hand, generative models such as Flow Matching pushed the boundary in image sampling yet lack a clear method for efficient use in image restoration. We propose to combine the PnP framework with Flow Matching (FM) by defining a time-dependent denoiser using a pre-trained FM model. Our algorithm alternates between gradient descent steps on the data-fidelity term, reprojections onto the learned FM path, and denoising. Notably, our method is computationally efficient and memory-friendly, as it avoids backpropagation through ODEs and trace computations. We evaluate its performance on denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting tasks, demonstrating superior results compared to existing PnP algorithms and Flow Matching based state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a wavelet-enhanced snow removal method that use a Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform feature enhancement module and a dynamic convolution acceleration module to address snow degradation in surveillance images. We also use a residual learning restoration module to remove veil effects caused by rain, snow, and fog. The proposed architecture extracts and analyzes information from snow-covered regions, significantly improving snow removal performance. And the residual learning restoration module removes veiling effects in images, enhancing clarity and detail. Experiments show that it performs better than some popular desnowing methods.

The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity.

Accurately quantifying this uncertainty is essential for the reliable interpretation of reconstructed images. However, image restoration methods often lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. Conformal prediction offers a rigorous framework to augment image restoration methods with accurate uncertainty quantification estimates, but it typically requires abundant ground truth data for calibration. This paper presents a self-supervised conformal prediction method for Poisson imaging problems which leverages Poisson Unbiased Risk Estimator to eliminate the need for ground truth data. The resulting self-calibrating conformal prediction approach is applicable to any Poisson linear imaging problem that is ill-conditioned, and is particularly effective when combined with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques trained directly on measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring; its performance are comparable to supervised conformal prediction methods relying on ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most convolutional neural network-based methods typically focus on a single scale, neglecting the incorporation of multi-scale information. In image restoration tasks, local features of an image are often insufficient, necessitating the integration of global features to complement them. Although recent neural network algorithms have made significant strides in feature extraction, many models do not explicitly model global features or consider the relationship between global and local features. This paper proposes multi-level attention-guided graph neural network. The proposed network explicitly constructs element block graphs and element graphs within feature maps using multi-attention mechanisms to extract both local structural features and global representation information of the image. Since the network struggles to effectively extract global information during image degradation, the structural information of local feature blocks can be used to correct and supplement the global information. Similarly, when element block information in the feature map is missing, it can be refined using global element representation information. The graph within the network learns real-time dynamic connections through the multi-attention mechanism, and information is propagated and aggregated via graph convolution algorithms. By combining local element block information and global element representation information from the feature map, the algorithm can more effectively restore missing information in the image. Experimental results on several classic image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Dual Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration from a Frequency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v2)** | 2025-02-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.01636v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework.

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/jp-guo/CODiff.</p></details> |  |

The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose AgenticIR, an agentic system that mimics the human approach to image processing by following five key stages: Perception, Scheduling, Execution, Reflection, and Rescheduling. AgenticIR leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) that interact via text generation to dynamically operate a toolbox of IR models. We fine-tune VLMs for image quality analysis and employ LLMs for reasoning, guiding the system step by step. To compensate for LLMs' lack of specific IR knowledge and experience, we introduce a self-exploration method, allowing the LLM to observe and summarize restoration results into referenceable documents. Experiments demonstrate AgenticIR's potential in handling complex IR tasks, representing a promising path toward achieving general intelligence in visual processing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

A reference image capturing the same scene of a corrupted image offers informative guidance for completing the corrupted image as it shares similar texture and structure priors to that of the holes of the corrupted image. In this work, we propose a transformer-based encoder-decoder network, named TransRef, for reference-guided image inpainting. Specifically, the guidance is conducted progressively through a reference embedding procedure, in which the referencing features are subsequently aligned and fused with the features of the corrupted image. For precise utilization of the reference features for guidance, a reference-patch alignment (Ref-PA) module is proposed to align the patch features of the reference and corrupted images and harmonize their style differences, while a reference-patch transformer (Ref-PT) module is proposed to refine the embedded reference feature. Moreover, to facilitate the research of reference-guided image restoration tasks, we construct a publicly accessible benchmark dataset containing 50K pairs of input and reference images. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the reference information and the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in completing complex holes.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo are available at https://ddcm-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for reliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed images inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image restoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates that are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a flexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification capabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To achieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for calibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data is often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth data can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between calibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach to conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a self-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy measurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for any linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is especially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration techniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably accurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction with ground truth data.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing image compression methods are tailored for clean images, therefore struggling to achieve satisfying results on these images. Joint compression and restoration methods typically focus on a single type of degradation and fail to address a variety of degradations in practice. To this end, we propose a unified framework for all-in-one image compression and restoration, which incorporates the image restoration capability against various degradations into the process of image compression. The key challenges involve distinguishing authentic image content from degradations, and flexibly eliminating various degradations without prior knowledge. Specifically, the proposed framework approaches these challenges from two perspectives: i.e., content information aggregation, and degradation representation aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the following merits of our model: 1) superior rate-distortion (RD) performance on various degraded inputs while preserving the performance on clean data; 2) strong generalization ability to real-world and unseen scenarios; 3) higher computing efficiency over compared methods.

ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

Toward this end, we present MorphoMod, a novel method for automated visible watermark removal that operates in a blind setting -- without requiring target images. Unlike existing methods, MorphoMod effectively removes opaque and transparent watermarks while preserving semantic content, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including the Colored Large-scale Watermark Dataset (CLWD), LOGO-series, and the newly introduced Alpha1 datasets, demonstrate that MorphoMod achieves up to a 50.8% improvement in watermark removal effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the impact of prompts used for inpainting, pre-removal filling strategies, and inpainting model performance on watermark removal. Additionally, a case study on steganographic disorientation reveals broader applications for watermark removal in disrupting high-level hidden messages.

To achieve this goal, current methods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Traditional ``Shape from X'' tasks usually use visual input (e.g., RGB images or depth maps) to reconstruct geometry, imposing strict constraints that limit creative explorations. As applications, works like Shadow Art and Wire Art often struggle to grasp the embedded semantics of their design through direct observation and rely heavily on specific setups for proper display. To address these limitations, our framework uses semantics as input, greatly expanding the design space to create objects that integrate multiple semantic elements and are easily discernible by observers. Considering that this task requires a rich imagination, we adopt various generative models and structure-to-detail pipelines. Specifically, we adopt multi-semantics Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to distill 3D geometry and appearance from 2D diffusion models, ensuring that the initial shape is consistent with the semantic input.

However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel Texture-Aware State Space Model, which enhances texture awareness and improves efficiency by modulating the transition matrix of the state-space equation and focusing on regions with complex textures. Additionally, we design a {Multi-Directional Perception Block} to improve multi-directional receptive fields while maintaining low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on benchmarks for image super-resolution, deraining, and low-light image enhancement demonstrate that TAMambaIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency, establishing it as a robust and efficient framework for image restoration.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Despite advances in deep learning-based super-resolution, existing methods overlook the causal nature of degradation by adopting simplistic black-box mappings. This paper formulates super-resolution using structural causal models to reason about image degradation processes. We establish a mathematical foundation that unifies principles from causal inference, deriving necessary conditions for identifying latent degradation mechanisms and corresponding propagation. We propose a novel counterfactual learning strategy that leverages semantic guidance to reason about hypothetical degradation scenarios, leading to theoretically-grounded representations that capture invariant features across different degradation conditions. The framework incorporates an adaptive intervention mechanism with provable bounds on treatment effects, allowing precise manipulation of degradation factors while maintaining semantic consistency. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with compound degradations. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by significant margins (0.86-1.21dB PSNR), while providing interpretable insights into the restoration process. The theoretical framework and empirical results demonstrate the fundamental importance of causal reasoning in understanding image restoration systems.</p></details> |  |

Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color artifacts in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a balance of regularization terms on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color artifacts reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,14figures |
| **[Universal Image Restoration Pre-training via Degradation Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15510v1)** | 2025-01-26 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.15510v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes the Degradation Classification Pre-Training (DCPT), which enables models to learn how to classify the degradation type of input images for universal image restoration pre-training. Unlike the existing self-supervised pre-training methods, DCPT utilizes the degradation type of the input image as an extremely weak supervision, which can be effortlessly obtained, even intrinsic in all image restoration datasets. DCPT comprises two primary stages. Initially, image features are extracted from the encoder. Subsequently, a lightweight decoder, such as ResNet18, is leveraged to classify the degradation type of the input image solely based on the features extracted in the first stage, without utilizing the input image. The encoder is pre-trained with a straightforward yet potent DCPT, which is used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Following DCPT, both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers demonstrate performance improvements, with gains of up to 2.55 dB in the 10D all-in-one restoration task and 6.53 dB in the mixed degradation scenarios. Moreover, previous self-supervised pretraining methods, such as masked image modeling, discard the decoder after pre-training, while our DCPT utilizes the pre-trained parameters more effectively. This superiority arises from the degradation classifier acquired during DCPT, which facilitates transfer learning between models of identical architecture trained on diverse degradation types.

Existing studies have focused on specific restoration problems such as image deblurring, denoising, and exposure correction where there is usually a strong assumption on the artifact type and severity. As a pioneer study in blind X-ray restoration, we propose a joint model for generic image restoration and classification: Restore-to-Classify Generative Adversarial Networks (R2C-GANs). Such a jointly optimized model keeps any disease intact after the restoration. Therefore, this will naturally lead to a higher diagnosis performance thanks to the improved X-ray image quality. To accomplish this crucial objective, we define the restoration task as an Image-to-Image translation problem from poor quality having noisy, blurry, or over/under-exposed images to high quality image domain. The proposed R2C-GAN model is able to learn forward and inverse transforms between the two domains using unpaired training samples. Simultaneously, the joint classification preserves the disease label during restoration. Moreover, the R2C-GANs are equipped with operational layers/neurons reducing the network depth and further boosting both restoration and classification performances. The proposed joint model is extensively evaluated over the QaTa-COV19 dataset for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification. The proposed restoration approach achieves over 90% F1-Score which is significantly higher than the performance of any deep model. Moreover, in the qualitative analysis, the restoration performance of R2C-GANs is approved by a group of medical doctors. We share the software implementation at https://github.com/meteahishali/R2C-GAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14264v1)** | 2025-01-24 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.14264v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, have significantly improved visual quality. However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

While denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have demonstrated notable success in tasks like image synthesis and restoration, traditional DDPMs rely on continuous data representations and mean squared error (MSE) loss for training, applying Gaussian noise models that may not be optimal for discrete or binary data structures. BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets. Notably, BDPM requires fewer inference steps than traditional DDPM models to reach optimal results, showcasing enhanced inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP)</p></details> |

We propose operating on quantized images because they offer easy abstraction for patch-based edits and palette transfer. In particular, we show that color palettes can make the output of the diffusion model easier to control and interpret. We first establish that existing image restoration methods are not sufficient, such as JPEG noise reduction models. We then demonstrate that our model can generate natural images that respect the color palette the user asked for. For palette transfer, we propose a method based on weighted bipartite matching. We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously. Our method can be usefully extended to another practical edit: recoloring patches of an image while respecting the source texture. Our procedure is supported by several qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 23 pages, 21 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, training models able to identify a spacecraft and its pose presents a significant challenge due to a lack of available image data for model training. This paper puts forth an innovative framework for generating realistic synthetic datasets of Resident Space Object (RSO) imagery. Using the International Space Station (ISS) as a test case, it goes on to combine image regression with image restoration methodologies to estimate pose from blurred images. An analysis of the proposed image recovery and regression techniques was undertaken, providing insights into the performance, potential enhancements and limitations when applied to real imagery of RSOs. The image recovery approach investigated involves first applying image deconvolution using an effective point spread function, followed by detail object extraction with a U-Net. Interestingly, using only U-Net for image reconstruction the best pose performance was attained, reducing the average Mean Squared Error in image recovery by 97.28% and the average angular error by 71.9%. The successful application of U-Net image restoration combined with the Resnet50 regression network for pose estimation of the International Space Station demonstrates the value of a diverse set of evaluation tools for effective solutions to real-world problems such as the analysis of distant objects in Earth's orbit.</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Existing dehazing models often neglect compression effects, which limits their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce three key contributions. First, we design FDG-Diff, a novel frequency-domain-guided dehazing framework that improves JPEG image restoration by leveraging frequency-domain information. Second, we introduce the High-Frequency Compensation Module (HFCM), which enhances spatial-domain detail restoration by incorporating frequency-domain augmentation techniques into a diffusion-based restoration framework. Lastly, the introduction of the Degradation-Aware Denoising Timestep Predictor (DADTP) module further enhances restoration quality by enabling adaptive region-specific restoration, effectively addressing regional degradation inconsistencies in compressed hazy images. Experimental results across multiple compressed dehazing datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches.

Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> |  |

However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Code will be opened after a patent application is granted</p></details> |

However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their initial success, most latent diffusion methods rely on fixed pretrained embeddings, limiting the benefits of joint training with the diffusion model. While jointly learning the embedding (via reconstruction loss) and the latent diffusion model (via score matching loss) could enhance performance, end-to-end training risks embedding collapse, degrading generation quality. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VQ-LCMD, a continuous-space latent diffusion framework within the embedding space that stabilizes training. VQ-LCMD uses a novel training objective combining the joint embedding-diffusion variational lower bound with a consistency-matching (CM) loss, alongside a shifted cosine noise schedule and random dropping strategy. Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed VQ-LCMD yields superior results on FFHQ, LSUN Churches, and LSUN Bedrooms compared to discrete-state latent diffusion models. In particular, VQ-LCMD achieves an FID of 6.81 for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet with 50 steps.</p></details> |  |

Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

In the present study, we introduce a novel framework designed to articulate object detection as a denoising diffusion process, which operates on the perturbed bounding boxes of annotated entities. This framework, termed \textbf{ConsistencyDet}, leverages an innovative denoising concept known as the Consistency Model. The hallmark of this model is its self-consistency feature, which empowers the model to map distorted information from any time step back to its pristine state, thereby realizing a \textbf{``few-step denoising''} mechanism. Such an attribute markedly elevates the operational efficiency of the model, setting it apart from the conventional Diffusion Model. Throughout the training phase, ConsistencyDet initiates the diffusion sequence with noise-infused boxes derived from the ground-truth annotations and conditions the model to perform the denoising task. Subsequently, in the inference stage, the model employs a denoising sampling strategy that commences with bounding boxes randomly sampled from a normal distribution. Through iterative refinement, the model transforms an assortment of arbitrarily generated boxes into definitive detections. Comprehensive evaluations employing standard benchmarks, such as MS-COCO and LVIS, corroborate that ConsistencyDet surpasses other leading-edge detectors in performance metrics.

Existing approaches often rely on image diffusion models to generate multi-view image observations, which are then transformed onto the mesh surface to produce a single texture. However, due to the gap between multi-view images and 3D space, such process is susceptible to arange of issues such as geometric inconsistencies, visibility occlusion, and baking artifacts. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach that directly generates texture on 3D meshes. Our approach leverages heat dissipation diffusion, which serves as an efficient operator that propagates features on the geometric surface of a mesh, while remaining insensitive to the specific layout of the wireframe. By integrating this technique into a generative diffusion pipeline, we significantly improve the efficiency of texture generation compared to existing texture generation methods. We term our approach DoubleDiffusion, as it combines heat dissipation diffusion with denoising diffusion to enable native generative learning on 3D mesh surfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/Wxyxixixi/DoubleDiffusion_3D_Mesh</p></details> |

This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic Segmentation Network based on a Conditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of DDPMs, named CDSegNet. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Stable-Makeup, a novel diffusion-based makeup transfer method capable of robustly transferring a wide range of real-world makeup, onto user-provided faces. Stable-Makeup is based on a pre-trained diffusion model and utilizes a Detail-Preserving (D-P) makeup encoder to encode makeup details. It also employs content and structural control modules to preserve the content and structural information of the source image. With the aid of our newly added makeup cross-attention layers in U-Net, we can accurately transfer the detailed makeup to the corresponding position in the source image. After content-structure decoupling training, Stable-Makeup can maintain content and the facial structure of the source image. Moreover, our method has demonstrated strong robustness and generalizability, making it applicable to varioustasks such as cross-domain makeup transfer, makeup-guided text-to-image generation and so on. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our approach delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) results among existing makeup transfer methods and exhibits a highly promising with broad potential applications in various related fields.

Previous Real-ISR models mostly focus on how to activate more generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models to make the output high-resolution (HR) images look better. However, since these methods rely too much on the generative priors, the content of the output images is often inconsistent with the input LR ones. To mitigate the above issue, in this work, we tame Diffusion Models by effectively utilizing LR information to impose stronger constraints on the control signals from ControlNet in the latent space. We show that our method can produce higher-quality control signals, which enables the super-resolution results to be more consistent with the LR image and leads to clearer visual results. In addition, we also propose an inference strategy that imposes constraints in the latent space using LR information, allowing for the simultaneous improvement of fidelity and generative ability. Experiments demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and generate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods.

However, due to compute limitations, each inference with these large models is confined to a small area, making long-range consistent scene generation challenging. To address this, we propose StarGen, a novel framework that employs a pre-trained video diffusion model in an autoregressive manner for long-range scene generation. The generation of each video clip is conditioned on the 3D warping of spatially adjacent images and the temporally overlapping image from previously generated clips, improving spatiotemporal consistency in long-range scene generation with precise pose control. The spatiotemporal condition is compatible with various input conditions, facilitating diverse tasks, including sparse view interpolation, perpetual view generation, and layout-conditioned city generation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate StarGen's superior scalability, fidelity, and pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

This field relies on accurate perception, understanding, and reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D images or text data sources. Diffusion models, originally designed for 2D generative tasks, offer the potential for more flexible, probabilistic methods that can better capture the variability and uncertainty present in real-world 3D data. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methods that use diffusion models for 3D visual tasks, including but not limited to 3D object generation, shape completion, point-cloud reconstruction, and scene construction. We provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying mathematical principles of diffusion models, outlining their forward and reverse processes, as well as the various architectural advancements that enable these models to work with 3D datasets. We also discuss the key challenges in applying diffusion models to 3D vision, such as handling occlusions and varying point densities, and the computational demands of high-dimensional data. Finally, we discuss potential solutions, including improving computational efficiency, enhancing multimodal fusion, and exploring the use of large-scale pretraining for better generalization across 3D tasks.

Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Quantization of diffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and memory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time, fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers, which account for a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However, the significant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing coarser-grained post-training quantization methods, combined with the complexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such large models to recover quality, makes them unsuitable for large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in them, we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in quantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle the fully quantized Winograd convolution, it struggles to deal with the large distribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation. To reduce range differences in the Winograd domain, we propose finetuning only the scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any domain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any training data, the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is safely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task, the 8-bit fully-quantized diffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP scores) in comparison to the full-precision model. For image classification, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Winograd PTQ method by 1.62% and 2.56% in top-1 ImageNet accuracy on ResNet18 and ResNet-34, respectively, with Winograd F(6, 3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by this intuition, we propose Visual Acoustic Fields, a framework that bridges hitting sounds and visual signals within a 3D space using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach features two key modules: sound generation and sound localization. The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

Established on the off-the-shelf text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, we propose a novel training-free text-guided image-to-image (I2I) translation framework dubbed as \textbf{P}hase-\textbf{T}ransferred \textbf{Diffusion} Model (PTDiffusion) for hidden art syntheses. PTDiffusion harmoniously embeds an input reference image into arbitrary scenes described by the text prompts, producing illusion images exhibiting hidden visual cues of the reference image. At the heart of our method is a plug-and-play phase transfer mechanism that dynamically and progressively transplants diffusion features' phase spectrum from the denoising process to reconstruct the reference image into the one to sample the generated illusion image, realizing deep fusion of the reference structural information and the textual semantic information in the diffusion model latent space. Furthermore, we propose asynchronous phase transfer to enable flexible control to the degree of hidden content discernability. Our method bypasses any model training and fine-tuning process, all while substantially outperforming related text-guided I2I methods in image generation quality, text fidelity, visual discernibility, and contextual naturalness for illusion picture synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.

However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles, enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models (DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication on A&A</p></details> |

To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.</p></details> |  |

Existing methodologies typically adopt two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the former architecture often suffers from decision-planning misalignment that incurs risky situations. Meanwhile, the latter struggles to balance short-term operational metrics (e.g., immediate motion smoothness) with long-term tactical goals (e.g., route efficiency), resulting in myopic or overly conservative behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM) empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach integrates driving task-oriented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with Top-K confidence elicitation, which facilitates high-level reasoning to generate multiple candidate decisions with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal trajectory. This framework enables the selection over trajectory candidates accounting for both low-level solution quality and high-level tactical confidence, which avoids the risks within one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations in short-sighted scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation environments demonstrate the competitive performance of CALMM-Drive across both common and long-tail benchmarks, showcasing a significant advancement in the integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs.

We introduce a computational framework that addresses this challenge through latent diffusion models operating within the EDM framework. Our approach reduces dimensionality via a custom variational autoencoder trained in binary geological volumes, improving efficiency and also enabling the generation of larger volumes than previously possible with diffusion models. A key innovation is our controlled unconditional sampling methodology, which enhances distribution coverage by first sampling target statistics from their empirical distributions, then generating samples conditioned on these values. Extensive testing on four distinct rock types demonstrates that conditioning on porosity - a readily computable statistic - is sufficient to ensure a consistent representation of multiple complex properties, including permeability, two-point correlation functions, and pore size distributions. The framework achieves better generation quality than pixel-space diffusion while enabling significantly larger volume reconstruction (256-cube voxels) with substantially reduced computational requirements, establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital rock physics applications.</p></details> | 58 pages |

While traditional score-based diffusion models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by introducing a new loss function based on the \emph{detailed balance condition}, allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail distributions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods employ a spatial propagation network to iteratively refine the depth map after obtaining an initial dense depth. In this paper, we propose DenseFormer, a novel method that integrates the diffusion model into the depth completion task. By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning.

However, existing methods either suffer from concept interference due to feature domain mismatch caused by naive decoupled optimizations or exhibit appearance contamination induced by spatial feature leakage resulting from the entanglement of motion and appearance in reference video reconstructions. In this paper, we propose JointTuner, a novel adaptive joint training framework, to alleviate these issues. Specifically, we develop Adaptive LoRA, which incorporates a context-aware gating mechanism, and integrate the gated LoRA components into the spatial and temporal Transformers within the diffusion model. These components enable simultaneous optimization of appearance and motion, eliminating concept interference. In addition, we introduce the Appearance-independent Temporal Loss, which decouples motion patterns from intrinsic appearance in reference video reconstructions through an appearance-agnostic noise prediction task. The key innovation lies in adding frame-wise offset noise to the ground-truth Gaussian noise, perturbing its distribution, thereby disrupting spatial attributes associated with frames while preserving temporal coherence. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark comprising 90 appearance-motion customized combinations and 10 multi-type automatic metrics across four dimensions, facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation for this customization task.

These large-scale VDMs have demonstrated significant improvements over smaller-scale VDMs across multiple dimensions, including enhanced visual quality and more natural motion dynamics. However, these models face two major limitations: (1) High inference overhead: Large-scale VDMs require approximately 10 minutes to synthesize a 28-step video on a single H100 GPU. (2) Limited in portrait video synthesis: Models like WanX-I2V and HunyuanVideo-I2V often produce unnatural facial expressions and movements in portrait videos. To address these challenges, we propose MagicDistillation, a novel framework designed to reduce inference overhead while ensuring the generalization of VDMs for portrait video synthesis. Specifically, we primarily use sufficiently high-quality talking video to fine-tune Magic141, which is dedicated to portrait video synthesis. We then employ LoRA to effectively and efficiently fine-tune the fake DiT within the step distillation framework known as distribution matching distillation (DMD). Following this, we apply weak-to-strong (W2S) distribution matching and minimize the discrepancy between the fake data distribution and the ground truth distribution, thereby improving the visual fidelity and motion dynamics of the synthesized videos. Experimental results on portrait video synthesis demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicDistillation, as our method surpasses Euler, LCM, and DMD baselines in both FID/FVD metrics and VBench. Moreover, MagicDistillation, requiring only 4 steps, also outperforms WanX-I2V (14B) and HunyuanVideo-I2V (13B) on visualization and VBench.

Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two weeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to the energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of surface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves spatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times. Leveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion models, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling super-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density associated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and lead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an efficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to super-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target. The innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale arbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid resolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting model errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed forecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality, outperforming baselines up to week 3.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 18 figures, preprint under review</p></details> |

Although much work have achieved remarkable success in text-driven face editing, they still face significant challenges as none of them simultaneously fulfill the characteristics of diversity, controllability and flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose MuseFace, a text-driven face editing framework, which relies solely on text prompt to enable face editing. Specifically, MuseFace integrates a Text-to-Mask diffusion model and a semantic-aware face editing model, capable of directly generating fine-grained semantic masks from text and performing face editing. The Text-to-Mask diffusion model provides \textit{diversity} and \textit{flexibility} to the framework, while the semantic-aware face editing model ensures \textit{controllability} of the framework. Our framework can create fine-grained semantic masks, making precise face editing possible, and significantly enhancing the controllability and flexibility of face editing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuseFace achieves superior high-fidelity performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures,IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo 2025</p></details> |

However, due to the partial priors provided by single-view input, existing methods are often limited to reconstruct low-consistency 3D scenes with narrow fields of view from single-view input. These limitations make them less capable of generalizing to reconstruct immersive scenes. To address this problem, we propose ExScene, a two-stage pipeline to reconstruct an immersive 3D scene from any given single-view image. ExScene designs a novel multimodal diffusion model to generate a high-fidelity and globally consistent panoramic image. We then develop a panoramic depth estimation approach to calculate geometric information from panorama, and we combine geometric information with high-fidelity panoramic image to train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. Following this, we introduce a GS refinement technique with 2D stable video diffusion priors. We add camera trajectory consistency and color-geometric priors into the denoising process of diffusion to improve color and spatial consistency across image sequences. These refined sequences are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our ExScene achieves consistent and immersive scene reconstruction using only single-view input, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

In this work, we integrate lateral connections with a substructure selection network to develop a novel diffusion model based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). Unlike conventional artificial neural networks, SNNs employ an intrinsic spiking inner loop to process sequential binary spikes. We leverage this spiking inner loop alongside a lateral connection mechanism to iteratively refine the substructure selection network, enhancing model adaptability and expressivity. Specifically, we design a lateral connection framework comprising a learnable lateral matrix and a lateral mapping function, both implemented using spiking neurons, to dynamically update lateral connections. Through mathematical modeling, we establish that the proposed lateral update mechanism, under a well-defined local objective, aligns with biologically plausible synaptic plasticity principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, analyzing the role of substructure selection and lateral connection during training. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SNN-based generative models across multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

Moreover, existing methods struggle to extract common features from similar elements (e.g., eyes of animals) appearing at varying positions across sketches. To address these challenges, we propose StrokeFusion, a two-stage framework for vector sketch generation. It contains a dual-modal sketch feature learning network that maps strokes into a high-quality latent space. This network decomposes sketches into normalized strokes and jointly encodes stroke sequences with Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) maps, representing sketches as sets of stroke feature vectors. Building upon this representation, our framework exploits a stroke-level latent diffusion model that simultaneously adjusts stroke position, scale, and trajectory during generation. This enables high-fidelity sketch generation while supporting stroke interpolation editing. Extensive experiments on the QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, validating its effectiveness in preserving structural integrity and semantic features. Code and models will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

Although diffusion models (DM) exhibit strong generative capabilities, their direct applications to CR are suboptimal, as they generate cloudless images from random noise, ignoring inherent information in cloudy inputs. To overcome this drawback, we develop a new CR model EMRDM based on mean-reverting diffusion models (MRDMs) to establish a direct diffusion process between cloudy and cloudless images. Compared to current MRDMs, EMRDM offers a modular framework with updatable modules and an elucidated design space, based on a reformulated forward process and a new ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based backward process. Leveraging our framework, we redesign key MRDM modules to boost CR performance, including restructuring the denoiser via a preconditioning technique, reorganizing the training process, and improving the sampling process by introducing deterministic and stochastic samplers. To achieve multi-temporal CR, we further develop a denoising network for simultaneously denoising sequential images. Experiments on mono-temporal and multi-temporal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EMRDM. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ly403/EMRDM.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |

Due to the binarization of weights and activations, the possible values of each entry in the feature maps generated by BNNs are strongly constrained. To tackle this limitation, we propose the expanding-and-shrinking operation, which enhances binary feature maps with negligible increase of computation complexity, thereby strengthening the representation capacity. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks reveal that our approach generalizes well across diverse applications ranging from image classification, object detection to generative diffusion model, while also achieving remarkable improvement over various leading binarization algorithms based on different architectures including both CNNs and Transformers.</p></details> |  |

It aims to generate complex scenes, where users require fine control over the layout of the objects in a scene. However, it remains challenging to control the object coherence, including semantic coherence (e.g., the cat looks at the flowers or not) and physical coherence (e.g., the hand and the racket should not be misaligned). In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model with effective global semantic fusion (GSF) and self-similarity feature enhancement modules to guide the object coherence for this task. For semantic coherence, we argue that the image caption contains rich information for defining the semantic relationship within the objects in the images. Instead of simply employing cross-attention between captions and latent images, which addresses the highly relevant layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement separately and thus leads to unsatisfying results shown in our experiments, we develop GSF to fuse the supervision from the layout restriction and semantic coherence requirement and exploit it to guide the image synthesis process. Moreover, to improve the physical coherence, we develop a Self-similarity Coherence Attention (SCA) module to explicitly integrate local contextual physical coherence relation into each pixel's generation process. Specifically, we adopt a self-similarity map to encode the physical coherence restrictions and employ it to extract coherent features from text embedding. Through visualization of our self-similarity map, we explore the essence of SCA, revealing that its effectiveness is not only in capturing reliable physical coherence patterns but also in enhancing complex texture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/CodeGoat24/EOCNet</p></details> |

However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</p></details> |  |

The model describes the dynamics of uninfected target cells, infected cells, and free virus particles, where the diffusion terms are nonlinear density functions. The primary objective is to recover the unknown diffusion functions by utilizing final-time measurement data. Due to the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem and the presence of measurement noise, we employ a Bayesian inference framework to obtain stable and reliable estimates while quantifying uncertainty. To solve the inverse problem efficiently, we develop an Iterative Regularizing Ensemble Kalman Method (IREKM), which enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple diffusion terms without requiring gradient information. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing the unknown diffusion terms under different noise levels, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of HIV infection dynamics and provide a computational approach for parameter estimation in fractional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

These high-resolution, language-guided synthesized images are essential for the explainability of disease or exploring causal relationships. However, their potential for disentangling and controlling latent factors of variation in specialized domains like medical imaging remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first investigation of the power of pre-trained vision-language foundation models, once fine-tuned on medical image datasets, to perform latent disentanglement for factorized medical image generation and interpolation. Through extensive experiments on chest X-ray and skin datasets, we illustrate that fine-tuned, language-guided Stable Diffusion inherently learns to factorize key attributes for image generation, such as the patient's anatomical structures or disease diagnostic features. We devise a framework to identify, isolate, and manipulate key attributes through latent space trajectory traversal of generative models, facilitating precise control over medical image synthesis.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation-especially the success of visual autoregressive methods-we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Extensive experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrate that MAG delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to three orders of magnitude in speedup during inference.</p></details> | Draft #1 |

The recent development of diffusion transformer (DiT) has witnessed overwhelming performance over the traditional UNet-based architecture in image generation, which also raises the question: Can we adopt the advanced DiT-based diffusion model for Real-ISR? To this end, we propose our DiT4SR, one of the pioneering works to tame the large-scale DiT model for Real-ISR. Instead of directly injecting embeddings extracted from low-resolution (LR) images like ControlNet, we integrate the LR embeddings into the original attention mechanism of DiT, allowing for the bidirectional flow of information between the LR latent and the generated latent. The sufficient interaction of these two streams allows the LR stream to evolve with the diffusion process, producing progressively refined guidance that better aligns with the generated latent at each diffusion step. Additionally, the LR guidance is injected into the generated latent via a cross-stream convolution layer, compensating for DiT's limited ability to capture local information. These simple but effective designs endow the DiT model with superior performance in Real-ISR, which is demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>JGR: ...</summary><p>JGR: Machine Learning and Computation, accepted</p></details> |

The twofold demand of concept erasure includes not only a precise removal of the target concept (i.e., erasure efficacy) but also a minimal change on non-target content (i.e., prior preservation), during generation. Existing methods face challenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and prior preservation, and they can be computationally costly. To improve, we propose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive Value Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. Our method is grounded in a classical linear algebraic operation of computing the orthogonal complement, implemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of diffusion models. We design a shift factor to adaptively navigate the erasure strength, enhancing effective prior preservation without sacrificing erasure efficacy. Extensive comparative experiments with both training-based and training-free state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed AdaVD excels in both single and multiple concept erasure, showing 2 to 10 times improvement in prior preservation than the second best, meanwhile achieving the best or near best erasure efficacy. AdaVD supports a series of diffusion models and downstream image generation tasks, with code available on: https://github.com/WYuan1001/AdaVD.</p></details> |  |

As T2I models require extensive data and computational resources for training, they constitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate owners, yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by adversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized, usually profitable applications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally involve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through generated outputs examination, or inspecting the model's feature space. However, these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios when the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning, and the feature space is inaccessible during verification ((i.e., black-box setting). The model is prone to forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a new task. To address this challenge, we propose SleeperMark, a novel framework designed to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark explicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the semantic concepts it learns, allowing the model to retain the embedded watermark while continuing to be adapted to new downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types of diffusion models, including latent diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and pixel diffusion models (e.g., DeepFloyd-IF), showing robustness against downstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels, with minimal impact on the model's generative capability.

In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively.

We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, miniImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.</p></details> | pre-print |

State-of-the-art methods alleviate such overhead in parallel diffusion inference through computation-communication overlapping, termed displaced parallelism. However, we identify that these techniques induce severe *staleness*-the usage of outdated activations from previous timesteps that significantly degrades quality, especially in expert-parallel scenarios. We tackle this fundamental tension and propose DICE, a staleness-centric optimization framework with a three-fold approach: (1) Interweaved Parallelism introduces staggered pipelines, effectively halving step-level staleness for free; (2) Selective Synchronization operates at layer-level and protects layers vulnerable from staled activations; and (3) Conditional Communication, a token-level, training-free method that dynamically adjusts communication frequency based on token importance. Together, these strategies effectively reduce staleness, achieving 1.26x speedup with minimal quality degradation. Empirical results establish DICE as an effective and scalable solution.

However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

However, most existing research emphasizes single-task reconstruction, neglecting model adaptability and generalization across multi-task systems. In this paper, we propose a novel generative semantic communication system that supports both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Our approach builds upon semantic knowledge bases (KBs) at both the transmitter and receiver, with each semantic KB comprising a source KB and a task KB. The source KB at the transmitter leverages a hierarchical Swin-Transformer, a generative AI scheme, to extract multi-level features from the input image. Concurrently, the counterpart source KB at the receiver utilizes hierarchical residual blocks to generate task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the task KBs adopt a semantic similarity model to map different task requirements into pre-defined task instructions, thereby facilitating the feature selection of the source KBs. Additionally, we develop a unified residual block-based joint source and channel (JSCC) encoder and two task-specific JSCC decoders to achieve the two image tasks. In particular, a generative diffusion model is adopted to construct the JSCC decoder for the image reconstruction task. Experimental results show that our multi-task generative semantic communication system outperforms previous single-task communication systems in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications Workshops and is scheduled for publication</p></details> |

This work presents a \textbf{D}egradation and \textbf{S}emantic \textbf{P}rior dual-guided framework for degraded image \textbf{Fusion} (\textbf{DSPFusion}), utilizing degradation priors and high-quality scene semantic priors restored via diffusion models to guide both information recovery and fusion in a unified model. In specific, it first individually extracts modality-specific degradation priors, while jointly capturing comprehensive low-quality semantic priors. Subsequently, a diffusion model is developed to iteratively restore high-quality semantic priors in a compact latent space, enabling our method to be over $20 \times$ faster than mainstream diffusion model-based image fusion schemes. Finally, the degradation priors and high-quality semantic priors are employed to guide information enhancement and aggregation via the dual-prior guidance and prior-guided fusion modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSPFusion mitigates most typical degradations while integrating complementary context with minimal computational cost, greatly broadening the application scope of image fusion.</p></details> |  |

One of the main difficulties is maintaining character consistency while creating natural and contextually fitting scenes--an area where many existing methods struggle. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Transformer module that uses separate self attention and cross attention mechanisms, leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models to ensure logical scene creation. The isolated self attention mechanism improves character consistency by refining attention maps to reduce focus on irrelevant areas and highlight key features of the same character. Meanwhile, the isolated cross attention mechanism independently processes each character's features, avoiding feature fusion and further strengthening consistency. Notably, our method is training-free, allowing the continuous generation of new characters and storylines without re-tuning. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms current methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

However, insufficient oversight in artificial Intelligence generated content (AIGC) can facilitate the spread of malicious content and increase the risk of copyright infringement. Among the diverse range of image generation models, the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) is currently the most widely used, dominating the majority of the Text-to-Image model market. Currently, most attribution methods for LDMs rely on directly embedding watermarks into the generated images or their intermediate noise, a practice that compromises both the quality and the robustness of the generated content. To address these limitations, we introduce TraceMark-LDM, an novel algorithm that integrates watermarking to attribute generated images while guaranteeing non-destructive performance. Unlike current methods, TraceMark-LDM leverages watermarks as guidance to rearrange random variables sampled from a Gaussian distribution. To mitigate potential deviations caused by inversion errors, the small absolute elements are grouped and rearranged. Additionally, we fine-tune the LDM encoder to enhance the robustness of the watermark. Experimental results show that images synthesized using TraceMark-LDM exhibit superior quality and attribution accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. Notably, TraceMark-LDM demonstrates exceptional robustness against various common attack methods, consistently outperforming SOTA methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures, |

However, achieving such coordination in robotics remains challenging due to the need to model object movement, predict future states, and generate precise bimanual actions. In this work, we address these challenges by infusing the predictive nature of human manipulation strategies into robot imitation learning. Specifically, we disentangle task-related state transitions from agent-specific inverse dynamics modeling to enable effective bimanual coordination. Using a demonstration dataset, we train a diffusion model to predict future states given historical observations, envisioning how the scene evolves. Then, we use an inverse dynamics model to compute robot actions that achieve the predicted states. Our key insight is that modeling object movement can help learning policies for bimanual coordination manipulation tasks. Evaluating our framework across diverse simulation and real-world manipulation setups, including multimodal goal configurations, bimanual manipulation, deformable objects, and multi-object setups, we find that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art state-to-action mapping policies. Our method demonstrates a remarkable capacity to navigate multimodal goal configurations and action distributions, maintain stability across different control modes, and synthesize a broader range of behaviors than those present in the demonstration dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://haonan16.github.io/coord_bimanual_page/. 12 pages, 12 figures, Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

While existing generalizable human radiance fields excel at novel view synthesis, they often struggle with comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Similarly, directly optimizing implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) fields from sparse-view images typically yields poor results due to limited overlap. To enhance 3D reconstruction quality, we propose using learnable tokens associated with SMPL vertices to aggregate sparse view features and then to guide SDF prediction. These tokens learn a generalizable prior across different identities in training datasets, leveraging the consistent projection of SMPL vertices onto similar semantic areas across various human identities. This consistency enables effective knowledge transfer to unseen identities during inference. Recognizing SMPL's limitations in capturing clothing details, we incorporate a diffusion model as an additional prior to fill in missing information, particularly for complex clothing geometries. Our method integrates two key priors in a coherent manner: the prior from generalizable feed-forward models and the 2D diffusion prior, and it requires only multi-view image training, without 3D supervision. DiHuR demonstrates superior performance in both within-dataset and cross-dataset generalization settings, as validated on THuman, ZJU-MoCap, and HuMMan datasets compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20240v2)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.20240v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://unconditional-priors-matter.github.io/</p></details> |

However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods.

However, a notable conditioning gap can be observed between these two fields, e.g., scalable 3D scene reconstruction often requires densely captured views, whereas 3D generation typically relies on a single or no input view, which significantly limits their applications. We found that the source of this phenomenon lies in the misalignment between 3D constraints and generative priors. To address this problem, we propose a reconstruction-driven video diffusion model that learns to condition video frames on artifact-prone RGB-D renderings. Moreover, we propose a cyclical fusion pipeline that iteratively adds restoration frames from the generative model to the training set, enabling progressive expansion and addressing the viewpoint saturation limitations seen in previous reconstruction and generation pipelines. Our evaluation, including view synthesis from sparse view and masked input, validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

Using image text caption as the bridge, a pipeline model integrates an image caption model, a text generation model, and an image generation model to handle this complex multi-modal task. However, representing the images with text captions may loss important visual details and information and cause error propagation in the complex dialogue system. Besides, the pipeline model isolates the three models separately because discrete image text captions hinder end-to-end gradient propagation. We propose the first end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation, which integrates an image perceptron and an image generator with a large language model. The large language model employs the Q-Former to perceive visual images in the input end. For image generation in the output end, we propose a dynamic vocabulary transformation matrix and use straight-through and gumbel-softmax techniques to align the large language model and stable diffusion model and achieve end-to-end gradient propagation. We perform experiments on PhotoChat and DialogCC datasets to evaluate our end-to-end model. Compared with pipeline models, the end-to-end model gains state-of-the-art performances on various metrics of text and image generation. More analysis experiments also verify the effectiveness of the end-to-end model for photo-sharing multi-modal dialogue generation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

Advancements in deep generative models, particularly diffusion models, have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in generating high-quality 2D images. Building on this success, various works have extended diffusion models to 3D point cloud generation. In contrast, alternative generative models such as flow matching have been proposed, offering a simple and intuitive transition from noise to meaningful outputs. However, the application of flow matching models to 3D point cloud generation remains largely unexplored. Gen-Swarms adapts these models to automatically generate drone shows. Existing 3D point cloud generative models create point trajectories which are impractical for drone swarms. In contrast, our method not only generates accurate 3D shapes but also guides the swarm motion, producing smooth trajectories and accounting for potential collisions through a reactive navigation algorithm incorporated into the sampling process. For example, when given a text category like Airplane, Gen-Swarms can rapidly and continuously generate numerous variations of 3D airplane shapes. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is particularly well-suited for drone shows, providing feasible trajectories, creating representative final shapes, and significantly enhancing the overall performance of drone show generation.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration.

Previous methods, such as MeshGPT, have explored the generation of ready-to-use 3D objects via mesh auto-regressive techniques. While these methods produce visually impressive results, their reliance on token-by-token predictions in the auto-regressive process leads to several significant limitations. These include extremely slow generation speeds and an uncontrollable number of mesh faces. In this paper, we introduce MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh generation, which leverages continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete triangle faces. Specifically, MeshCraft consists of two core components: 1) a transformer-based VAE that encodes raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens and decodes them back to the original meshes, and 2) a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces, enabling the generation of high-quality 3D meshes with a predefined number of faces. By utilizing the diffusion model for the simultaneous generation of the entire mesh topology, MeshCraft achieves high-fidelity mesh generation at significantly faster speeds compared to auto-regressive methods. Specifically, MeshCraft can generate an 800-face mesh in just 3.2 seconds (35$\times$ faster than existing baselines). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshCraft outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ShapeNet dataset and demonstrates superior performance on Objaverse dataset. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with existing conditional guidance strategies, showcasing its potential to relieve artists from the time-consuming manual work involved in mesh creation.</p></details> |  |

SCA requires no additional parameters, enabling seamless incorporation into current DiT-based architectures. To facilitate high-quality long video generation, we build the LongTake-HD dataset, consisting of 261k content-rich videos with scenario coherence, annotated with an overall video caption and five progressive sub-captions.

Existing guided diffusion models either rely on training the guidance model with pre-collected datasets or require the objective functions to be differentiable. However, for most real-world tasks, offline datasets are often unavailable, and their objective functions are often not differentiable, such as image generation with human preferences, molecular generation for drug discovery, and material design. Thus, we need an $\textbf{online}$ algorithm capable of collecting data during runtime and supporting a $\textbf{black-box}$ objective function. Moreover, the $\textbf{query efficiency}$ of the algorithm is also critical because the objective evaluation of the query is often expensive in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel and simple algorithm, $\textbf{Fast Direct}$, for query-efficient online black-box target generation. Our Fast Direct builds a pseudo-target on the data manifold to update the noise sequence of the diffusion model with a universal direction, which is promising to perform query-efficient guided generation. Extensive experiments on twelve high-resolution ($\small {1024 \times 1024}$) image target generation tasks and six 3D-molecule target generation tasks show $\textbf{6}\times$ up to $\textbf{10}\times$ query efficiency improvement and $\textbf{11}\times$ up to $\textbf{44}\times$ query efficiency improvement, respectively.

Efforts such as progressive distillation or consistency distillation have shown promise by reducing the number of passes at the expense of quality of the generated samples. In this work we identify co-variate shift as one of reason for poor performance of multi-step distilled models from compounding error at inference time. To address co-variate shift, we formulate diffusion distillation within imitation learning (DDIL) framework and enhance training distribution for distilling diffusion models on both data distribution (forward diffusion) and student induced distributions (backward diffusion). Training on data distribution helps to diversify the generations by preserving marginal data distribution and training on student distribution addresses compounding error by correcting covariate shift. In addition, we adopt reflected diffusion formulation for distillation and demonstrate improved performance, stable training across different distillation methods. We show that DDIL consistency improves on baseline algorithms of progressive distillation (PD), Latent consistency models (LCM) and Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD2).</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic 4D generation methods typically rely on distilling knowledge from pre-trained 3D generative models, often fine-tuned on synthetic object datasets. Consequently, the resulting scenes tend to be object-centric and lack photorealism. While text-to-video models can generate more realistic scenes with motion, they often struggle with spatial understanding and provide limited control over camera viewpoints during rendering. To address these limitations, we present PaintScene4D, a novel text-to-4D scene generation framework that departs from conventional multi-view generative models in favor of a streamlined architecture that harnesses video generative models trained on diverse real-world datasets. Our method first generates a reference video using a video generation model, and then employs a strategic camera array selection for rendering. We apply a progressive warping and inpainting technique to ensure both spatial and temporal consistency across multiple viewpoints. Finally, we optimize multi-view images using a dynamic renderer, enabling flexible camera control based on user preferences. Adopting a training-free architecture, our PaintScene4D efficiently produces realistic 4D scenes that can be viewed from arbitrary trajectories. The code will be made publicly available.

Existing diffusion-model-based researches either rely on per-view inpainting techniques, which are plagued by severe cross-view inconsistencies and conspicuous seams, or adopt optimization-based approaches that involve substantial computational overhead. In this work, we present RoomPainter, a framework that seamlessly integrates efficiency and consistency to achieve high-fidelity texturing of indoor scenes. The core of RoomPainter features a zero-shot technique that effectively adapts a 2D diffusion model for 3D-consistent texture synthesis, along with a two-stage generation strategy that ensures both global and local consistency. Specifically, we introduce Attention-Guided Multi-View Integrated Sampling (MVIS) combined with a neighbor-integrated attention mechanism for zero-shot texture map generation. Using the MVIS, we firstly generate texture map for the entire room to ensure global consistency, then adopt its variant, namely Attention-Guided Multi-View Integrated Repaint Sampling (MVRS) to repaint individual instances within the room, thereby further enhancing local consistency and addressing the occlusion problem. Experiments demonstrate that RoomPainter achieves superior performance for indoor scene texture synthesis in visual quality, global consistency and generation efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Without structured supervision -- such as camera poses, 3D part annotations, or object-specific labels -- the model must infer plausible 3D structures, capture fine-grained details, and generalize to novel objects using only category-level labels from seen categories. To address this, Chirpy3D introduces a multi-view diffusion model that decomposes training objects into anchor parts in an unsupervised manner, representing the latent space of both seen and unseen parts as continuous distributions. This allows smooth interpolation and flexible recombination of parts to generate entirely new objects with species-specific details. A self-supervised feature consistency loss further ensures structural and semantic coherence. The result is the first system capable of generating entirely novel 3D objects with species-specific fine-grained details through flexible part sampling and composition. Our experiments demonstrate that Chirpy3D surpasses existing methods in generating creative 3D objects with higher quality and fine-grained details. Code will be released at https://github.com/kamwoh/chirpy3d.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: (a) a sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and (b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of these methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model, while a comparison with the deep Galerkin method and the deep BSDE solver with jumps further supports the merits of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

One such constraint is that the 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remains balanced under gravity. Prior approaches to generating stable 3D objects used differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test-time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models to external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO), a framework to use the feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator outputs stable 3D objects directly. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with a stability score obtained from the physics simulator. We can then fine-tune the 3D generator using the stability score as the alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO), a novel objective, which we introduce, to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either DPO or DRO objective, is much faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework works even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/dso</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce \emph{Patronus}, an interpretable diffusion model inspired by ProtoPNet. Patronus integrates a prototypical network into DDPMs, enabling the extraction of prototypes and conditioning of the generation process on their prototype activation vector. This design enhances interpretability by showing the learned prototypes and how they influence the generation process. Additionally, the model supports downstream tasks like image manipulation, enabling more transparent and controlled modifications. Moreover, Patronus could reveal shortcut learning in the generation process by detecting unwanted correlations between learned prototypes. Notably, Patronus operates entirely without any annotations or text prompts. This work opens new avenues for understanding and controlling diffusion models through prototype-based interpretability.

Nonetheless, recent approaches to 4D generation still struggle with fundamental limitations, as they primarily rely on harnessing multiple video diffusion models with additional training or compute-intensive training of a full 4D diffusion model with limited real-world 4D data and large computational costs. To address these challenges, here we propose the first training-free 4D video generation method that leverages the off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate multi-view videos from a single input video. Our approach consists of two key steps: (1) By designating the edge frames in the spatio-temporal sampling grid as key frames, we first synthesize them using a video diffusion model, leveraging a depth-based warping technique for guidance. This approach ensures structural consistency across the generated frames, preserving spatial and temporal coherence. (2) We then interpolate the remaining frames using a video diffusion model, constructing a fully populated and temporally coherent sampling grid while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Through this approach, we extend a single video into a multi-view video along novel camera trajectories while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency. Our method is training-free and fully utilizes an off-the-shelf video diffusion model, offering a practical and effective solution for multi-view video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://zero4dvid.github.io/</p></details> |

Denoise training that is closely related to diffusion probabilistic model has been shown to enhance the temporal stability of neural solvers, while its stochastic inference mechanism enables ensemble predictions and uncertainty quantification. In principle, such training involves sampling a series of discretized diffusion timesteps during both training and inference, inevitably increasing computational overhead. In addition, most diffusion models apply isotropic Gaussian noise on structured, uniform grids, limiting their adaptability to irregular domains. We propose a latent diffusion model for PDE simulation that embeds the PDE state in a lower-dimensional latent space, which significantly reduces computational costs. Our framework uses an autoencoder to map different types of meshes onto a unified structured latent grid, capturing complex geometries. By analyzing common diffusion paths, we propose to use a coarsely sampled noise schedule from flow matching for both training and testing. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several deterministic baselines in both accuracy and long-term stability, highlighting the potential of diffusion-based approaches for robust data-driven PDE learning.</p></details> | work in progress |

Inspired by the Regularization by Denoising principle, we introduce an approach that integrates a Latent Diffusion Model, trained for the denoising task, into a variational framework using Half-Quadratic Splitting, exploiting its regularization properties. This approach, under appropriate conditions that can be easily met in various imaging applications, allows for reduced computational cost while achieving high-quality results. The proposed strategy, called Regularization by Latent Denoising (RELD), is then tested on a dataset of natural images, for image denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks. The numerical experiments show that RELD is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving remarkable results when evaluated using perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, their outputs are often non-deterministic and lack high fidelity to the ground truth due to the inherent randomness. In this paper, we propose a novel High-fidelity Brownian bridge model (HiFi-BBrg) for deterministic medical image translations. Our model comprises two distinct yet mutually beneficial mappings: a generation mapping and a reconstruction mapping. The Brownian bridge training process is guided by the fidelity loss and adversarial training in the reconstruction mapping. This ensures that translated images can be accurately reversed to their original forms, thereby achieving consistent translations with high fidelity to the ground truth. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets show HiFi-BBrg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal image translation and multi-image super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

UniCon reduces computational demands by eliminating the need for the diffusion model to compute and store gradients during adapter training. Our results indicate that UniCon reduces GPU memory usage by one-third and increases training speed by 2.3 times, while maintaining the same adapter parameter size. Additionally, without requiring extra computational resources, UniCon enables the training of adapters with double the parameter volume of existing ControlNets. In a series of image conditional generation tasks, UniCon has demonstrated precise responsiveness to control inputs and exceptional generation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and, as such, require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover, we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting, enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters, 6x lower generation latency, and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments, especially on long and adversarial driving environments.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Existing methods utilize masks derived from cross-attention maps generated from diffusion models to identify the target regions for modification. However, since cross-attention mechanisms focus on semantic relevance, they struggle to maintain the image integrity. As a result, these methods often lack spatial consistency, leading to editing artifacts and distortions. In this work, we address these limitations and introduce LOCATEdit, which enhances cross-attention maps through a graph-based approach utilizing self-attention-derived patch relationships to maintain smooth, coherent attention across image regions, ensuring that alterations are limited to the designated items while retaining the surrounding structure. LOCATEdit consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on PIE-Bench, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness on various editing tasks.

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. The code, model weights, and dataset will be released publicly upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging, particularly for the joint camera pose estimation. Previous approaches have achieved impressive pose-free surface reconstruction results in dense-view settings, but could easily fail for sparse-view scenarios without sufficient visual overlap. In this paper, we propose a new technique for pose-free surface reconstruction, which follows triplane-based signed distance field (SDF) learning but regularizes the learning by explicit points sampled from ray-based diffusion of camera pose estimation. Our key contribution is a novel Geometric Consistent Ray Diffusion model (GCRayDiffusion), where we represent camera poses as neural bundle rays and regress the distribution of noisy rays via a diffusion model. More importantly, we further condition the denoising process of RGRayDiffusion using the triplane-based SDF of the entire scene, which provides effective 3D consistent regularization to achieve multi-view consistent camera pose estimation. Finally, we incorporate RGRayDiffusion into the triplane-based SDF learning by introducing on-surface geometric regularization from the sampling points of the neural bundle rays, which leads to highly accurate pose-free surface reconstruction results even for sparse-view inputs. Extensive evaluations on public datasets show that our GCRayDiffusion achieves more accurate camera pose estimation than previous approaches, with geometrically more consistent surface reconstruction results, especially given sparse-view inputs.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, image and video tasks are typically handled in isolation, with little focus on integrating them for video transfer. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel task, Semantic Style Transfer, which involves transferring style and appearance features from a reference image to a target visual content based on semantic correspondence. We subsequently propose a training-free method, Semantix an energy-guided sampler designed for Semantic Style Transfer that simultaneously guides both style and appearance transfer based on semantic understanding capacity of pre-trained diffusion models. Additionally, as a sampler, Semantix be seamlessly applied to both image and video models, enabling semantic style transfer to be generic across various visual media. Specifically, once inverting both reference and context images or videos to noise space by SDEs, Semantix utilizes a meticulously crafted energy function to guide the sampling process, including three key components: Style Feature Guidance, Spatial Feature Guidance and Semantic Distance as a regularisation term. Experimental results demonstrate that Semantix not only effectively accomplishes the task of semantic style transfer across images and videos, but also surpasses existing state-of-the-art solutions in both fields.

We estimate the watermark distribution using an unconditional diffusion model and introduce shallow inversion to inject the watermark into a non-watermarked image seamlessly. This approach facilitates watermark injection while preserving image quality by adaptively selecting the depth of inversion steps, leveraging our key insight that watermarks degrade with added noise during the early diffusion phases.

Recent works introduce pretrained Diffusion Models (DMs) into this task. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale training data and comprehensive benchmarks, the optimal methodologies for employing DMs in stereo conversion and the accurate evaluation of stereo effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the Mono2Stereo dataset, providing high-quality training data and benchmark to support in-depth exploration of stereo conversion. With this dataset, we conduct an empirical study that yields two primary findings. 1) The differences between the left and right views are subtle, yet existing metrics consider overall pixels, failing to concentrate on regions critical to stereo effects. 2) Mainstream methods adopt either one-stage left-to-right generation or warp-and-inpaint pipeline, facing challenges of degraded stereo effect and image distortion respectively. Based on these findings, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Stereo Intersection-over-Union, which prioritizes disparity and achieves a high correlation with human judgments on stereo effect. Moreover, we propose a strong baseline model, harmonizing the stereo effect and image quality simultaneously, and notably surpassing current mainstream methods.

Therefore, it is essential to verify the integrity of T2I diffusion models. To this end, considering the randomness within the outputs of generative models and the high costs in interacting with them, we discern model tampering via the KL divergence between the distributions of the features of generated images. We propose a novel prompt selection algorithm based on learning automaton (PromptLA) for efficient and accurate verification. Evaluations on four advanced T2I models (e.g., SDXL, FLUX.1) demonstrate that our method achieves a mean AUC of over 0.96 in integrity detection, exceeding baselines by more than 0.2, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalization. Additionally, our approach achieves lower cost and is robust against image-level post-processing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work addressing the integrity verification of T2I diffusion models, which establishes quantifiable standards for AI copyright litigation in practice.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The inventories, sourced from the PhysPort website, cover classical physics topics such as mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics, as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images to reflect what a student would see on paper, thereby assessing the system's multimodal functionality. Our results indicate variation in performance across subjects, with laboratory skills standing out as the weakest. We also observe differences across languages, with English and European languages showing the strongest performance. Notably, the relative difficulty of an inventory item is largely independent of the language of the survey. When comparing AI results to existing literature on student performance, we find that the AI system outperforms average post-instruction undergraduate students in all subject categories except laboratory skills. Furthermore, the AI performs worse on items requiring visual interpretation of images than on those that are purely text-based.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods. Last, we provide in-depth analyses of model scaling and training strategies, and perform ablation studies on both the model and synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, models at https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gme-Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct</p></details> |

By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings. Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights. Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis. Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening.

As one of the primary causes of road accidents in C-ITS, the efficient detection and early alarm of road hazards are of paramount importance. Given the importance, extensive research has explored this topic and obtained favorable results. However, most existing solutions only explore single-modality data, struggle with high computation and communication overhead, or suffer from the curse of high dimensionality in their privacy-preserving methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, we introduce RoadFed, an innovative and private multimodal Federated learning-based system tailored for intelligent Road hazard detection and alarm. This framework encompasses an innovative Multimodal Road Hazard Detector, a communication-efficient federated learning approach, and a customized low-error-rate local differential privacy method crafted for high dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results reveal that the proposed RoadFed surpasses most existing systems in the self-gathered real-world and CrisisMMD public datasets. In particular, RoadFed achieves an accuracy of 96.42% with a mere 0.0351 seconds of latency and its communication cost is up to 1,000 times lower than existing systems in this field. It facilitates collaborative training with non-iid high dimensional multimodal real-world data across various data modalities on multiple edges while ensuring privacy preservation for road users.</p></details> |  |

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that MLLM visual encoders often fail to distinguish visually different yet semantically similar video pairs, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding. It consists of 5,002 videos, paired to highlight cases prone to hallucinations. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results show that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations across all tasks. Both the VidHalluc benchmark and DINO-HEAL code are available at https://people-robots.github.io/vidhalluc.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Built on top of LLMs, vision large language models (VLLMs) have advanced significantly in areas such as recognition, reasoning, and grounding. However, investigations into \emph{multimodal ICL} have predominantly focused on few-shot visual question answering (VQA), and image captioning, which we will show neither exploit the strengths of ICL, nor test its limitations. The broader capabilities and limitations of multimodal ICL remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark VL-ICL Bench for multimodal in-context learning, encompassing a broad spectrum of tasks that involve both images and text as inputs and outputs, and different types of challenges, from {perception to reasoning and long context length}. We evaluate the abilities of state-of-the-art VLLMs against this benchmark suite, revealing their diverse strengths and weaknesses, and showing that even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4, find the tasks challenging. By highlighting a range of new ICL tasks, and the associated strengths and limitations of existing models, we hope that our dataset will inspire future work on enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of VLLMs, as well as inspire new applications that leverage VLLM ICL.

These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models.

As image generation techniques become increasingly sophisticated, detecting synthetic images is no longer just a binary task: it necessitates interpretable, context-aware methodologies that enhance trustworthiness and transparency. However, existing detection models primarily focus on classification, offering limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. In this work, we propose FakeScope, an expert multimodal model (LMM) tailored for AI-generated image forensics, which not only identifies AI-synthetic images with high accuracy but also provides rich, interpretable, and query-driven forensic insights. We first construct FakeChain dataset that contains linguistic authenticity reasoning based on visual trace evidence, developed through a novel human-machine collaborative framework. Building upon it, we further present FakeInstruct, the largest multimodal instruction tuning dataset containing 2 million visual instructions tailored to enhance forensic awareness in LMMs. FakeScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-ended and open-ended forensic scenarios. It can distinguish synthetic images with high accuracy while offering coherent and insightful explanations, free-form discussions on fine-grained forgery attributes, and actionable enhancement strategies. Notably, despite being trained exclusively on qualitative hard labels, FakeScope demonstrates remarkable zero-shot quantitative capability on detection, enabled by our proposed token-based probability estimation strategy. Furthermore, FakeScope exhibits strong generalization and in-the-wild ability, ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Among NSCLC patients, approximately 32.3% have mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC patients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its established efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for patients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to accurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a critical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an interpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient resistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This machine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected during patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung cancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data types such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data, demographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate well-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the superior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models (c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of combining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction.</p></details> |  |

Evaluation often relies on automatic speech recognition, which may introduce bias. We propose SVLA, a unified speech vision language model based on a transformer architecture that handles multimodal inputs and outputs. We train it on 38.2 million speech text image examples, including 64.1 hours of synthetic speech. We also introduce Speech VQA Accuracy, a new metric for evaluating spoken responses. SVLA improves multimodal understanding and generation by better combining speech, vision, and language.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This work introduces IMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality registration), a generic semantic similarity metric designed for seamless integration into diverse image registration frameworks (such as Elastix and Voxelmorph). It compares deep learning-based features extracted from medical images without requiring task-specific training, ensuring broad applicability across various modalities. By leveraging the features of the large-scale pretrained TotalSegmentator models and the ability to integrate Segment Anything Model (SAM) and other large-scale segmentation networks, this approach offers significant advantages. It provides robust, scalable, and efficient solutions for multimodal image registration. The IMPACT loss was evaluated on five challenging registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT, and pelvic MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, such as Target Registration Error and Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated significant improvements in anatomical alignment compared to baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further confirmed the increased robustness of the proposed metric in the face of noise, artifacts, and modality variations.

Existing methodologies typically adopt two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the former architecture often suffers from decision-planning misalignment that incurs risky situations. Meanwhile, the latter struggles to balance short-term operational metrics (e.g., immediate motion smoothness) with long-term tactical goals (e.g., route efficiency), resulting in myopic or overly conservative behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM) empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach integrates driving task-oriented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with Top-K confidence elicitation, which facilitates high-level reasoning to generate multiple candidate decisions with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal trajectory. This framework enables the selection over trajectory candidates accounting for both low-level solution quality and high-level tactical confidence, which avoids the risks within one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations in short-sighted scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation environments demonstrate the competitive performance of CALMM-Drive across both common and long-tail benchmarks, showcasing a significant advancement in the integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Current MLLM-based MERC studies focus mainly on capturing the speaker's textual or vocal characteristics, but ignore the significance of video-derived behavior information. Different from text and audio inputs, learning videos with rich facial expression, body language and posture, provides emotion trigger signals to the models for more accurate emotion predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-aware MLLM-based framework (BeMERC) to incorporate speaker's behaviors, including subtle facial micro-expression, body language and posture, into a vanilla MLLM-based MERC model, thereby facilitating the modeling of emotional dynamics during a conversation. Furthermore, BeMERC adopts a two-stage instruction tuning strategy to extend the model to the conversations scenario for end-to-end training of a MERC predictor. Experiments demonstrate that BeMERC achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, and also provides a detailed discussion on the significance of video-derived behavior information in MERC.</p></details> |  |

During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training speed and hindering further research on MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data. Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an 84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks usually adopt notably smaller image sizes than real-world RS scenarios, suffer from limited annotation quality, and consider insufficient dimensions of evaluation. To address these issues, we present XLRS-Bench: a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in ultra-high-resolution RS scenarios. XLRS-Bench boasts the largest average image size (8500$\times$8500) observed thus far, with all evaluation samples meticulously annotated manually, assisted by a novel semi-automatic captioner on ultra-high-resolution RS images. On top of the XLRS-Bench, 16 sub-tasks are defined to evaluate MLLMs' 10 kinds of perceptual capabilities and 6 kinds of reasoning capabilities, with a primary emphasis on advanced cognitive processes that facilitate real-world decision-making and the capture of spatiotemporal changes.

In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel model merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the challenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we first design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs with different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model weights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in the hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method for model merging.

To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results.

In particular, they have been shown to surpass specialized models in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Nevertheless, their performance under different image conditions remains insufficiently investigated, and individual character recognition is not guaranteed due to their reliance on contextual cues. In this work, we examine a context-independent OCR task using single-character images with diverse visual complexities to determine the conditions for accurate recognition. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs can match conventional OCR methods at about 300 ppi, yet their performance deteriorates significantly below 150 ppi. Additionally, we observe a very weak correlation between visual complexity and misrecognitions, whereas a conventional OCR-specific model exhibits no correlation. These results suggest that image resolution and visual complexity may play an important role in the reliable application of multimodal LLMs to OCR tasks that require precise character-level accuracy.</p></details> |  |

For example, the model reasons that to "break down" visually complex spatial tasks, making a tool call to a Python interpreter to perform tasks (such as cropping, image segmentation, or saturation changes) would improve performance significantly. Our experimentation shows that explicitly evoking this "tool calling" call, via system-level XML $...\texttt{<tool>} ... \texttt{</tool>}...$ tags, can effectively flag Python interpreter access for the same language model to generate relevant programs, generating advanced multimodal functionality. This functionality can be crystallized into a system-level prompt that induces improved performance at inference time, and our experimentation suggests up to $\approx 50\%$ relative improvement across select visual tasks. Downstream performance is trained and evaluated across subtasks from MathVista, M3CoT, and GeoBench-VLM datasets. Importantly, our approach shows that evolutionary prompt optimization guides language models towards self-reasoning discoveries, which result in improved zero-shot generalization across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for LLMs</p></details> |

This study introduces an innovative deep learning-based model leveraging multimodal data-2D RGB images from different views, depth images, and 3D point clouds-for the non-invasive estimation of duck body dimensions and weight. A dataset of 1,023 Linwu ducks, comprising over 5,000 samples with diverse postures and conditions, was collected to support model training. The proposed method innovatively employs PointNet++ to extract key feature points from point clouds, extracts and computes corresponding 3D geometric features, and fuses them with multi-view convolutional 2D features. A Transformer encoder is then utilized to capture long-range dependencies and refine feature interactions, thereby enhancing prediction robustness. The model achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.33% and an R2 of 0.953 across eight morphometric parameters, demonstrating strong predictive capability. Unlike conventional manual measurements, the proposed model enables high-precision estimation while eliminating the necessity for physical handling, thereby reducing animal stress and broadening its application scope. This study marks the first application of deep learning techniques to poultry body dimension and weight estimation, providing a valuable reference for the intelligent and precise management of the livestock industry with far-reaching practical significance.</p></details> |  |

However, previous research has predominantly treated modalities in isolation, typically assuming item content is unimodal (usually text). We argue that this is a significant limitation given the rich, multimodal nature of real-world data and the potential sensitivity of GR models to modality choices and usage. Our work aims to explore the critical problem of Multimodal Generative Recommendation (MGR), highlighting the importance of modality choices in GR nframeworks. We reveal that GR models are particularly sensitive to different modalities and examine the challenges in achieving effective GR when multiple modalities are available. By evaluating design strategies for effectively leveraging multiple modalities, we identify key challenges and introduce MGR-LF++, an enhanced late fusion framework that employs contrastive modality alignment and special tokens to denote different modalities, achieving a performance improvement of over 20% compared to single-modality alternatives.</p></details> |  |

However, in remote sensing (RS), high resolution and small proportion of objects pose challenges to existing MLLMs, which struggle with object-centric tasks, particularly in precise localization and fine-grained attribute description for each object. These RS MLLMs have not yet surpassed classical visual perception models, as they only provide coarse image understanding, leading to limited gains in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we establish EagleVision, an MLLM tailored for remote sensing that excels in object detection and attribute comprehension. Equipped with the Attribute Disentangle module, EagleVision learns disentanglement vision tokens to express distinct attributes. To support object-level visual-language alignment, we construct EVAttrs-95K, the first large-scale object attribute understanding dataset in RS for instruction tuning, along with a novel evaluation benchmark, EVBench. EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on both fine-grained object detection and object attribute understanding tasks, highlighting the mutual promotion between detection and understanding capabilities in MLLMs. The code, model, data, and demo will be available at https://github.com/XiangTodayEatsWhat/EagleVision.</p></details> | Under Review |

MM-GRAPH extends beyond existing text-attributed graph benchmarks, offering a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal graph learning Our benchmark comprises seven diverse datasets of varying scales (ranging from thousands to millions of edges), designed to assess algorithms across different tasks in real-world scenarios. These datasets feature rich multimodal node attributes, including visual data, which enables a more holistic evaluation of various graph learning frameworks in complex, multimodal environments. To support advancements in this emerging field, we provide an extensive empirical study on various graph learning frameworks when presented with features from multiple modalities, particularly emphasizing the impact of visual information.

In this study, we curate data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls database to develop a multimodal dataset, RECALL-MM, that informs data-driven risk assessment using historical information, and augment it using generative methods. Patterns in the dataset highlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant impact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps that embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions and product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case studies to demonstrate the dataset's utility in identifying product risks and guiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how designers can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new product ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate hazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large language model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product images. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage visual context to identify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data across many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas where hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of risk awareness throughout the design process. Collectively, this work aims to bridge the gap between historical recall data and future product safety, presenting a scalable, data-driven approach to safer engineering design.</p></details> |  |

The rapid growth of video content on social platforms and streaming services, along with privacy concerns, has increased the need for contextual advertising. Placing the right ad in the right context creates a seamless and pleasant ad viewing experience, resulting in higher audience engagement and, ultimately, better ad monetization. From a technology standpoint, effective contextual advertising requires a video retrieval system capable of understanding complex video content at a very granular level. Current text-to-video retrieval models based on joint multimodal training demand large datasets and computational resources, limiting their practicality and lacking the key functionalities required for ad ecosystem integration. We introduce ContextIQ, a multimodal expert-based video retrieval system designed specifically for contextual advertising. ContextIQ utilizes modality-specific experts-video, audio, transcript (captions), and metadata such as objects, actions, emotion, etc.-to create semantically rich video representations. We show that our system, without joint training, achieves better or comparable results to state-of-the-art models and commercial solutions on multiple text-to-video retrieval benchmarks. Our ablation studies highlight the benefits of leveraging multiple modalities for enhanced video retrieval accuracy instead of using a vision-language model alone. Furthermore, we show how video retrieval systems such as ContextIQ can be used for contextual advertising in an ad ecosystem while also addressing concerns related to brand safety and filtering inappropriate content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at WACV 2025</p></details> |

Visual scenes are defined by the composition of objects and their relations. Hence, it is essential for computer vision systems to reflect and exploit this compositionality to achieve robust and generalizable scene understanding. While major strides have been made toward the development of general-purpose, multimodal generative models, including both text-to-image models and multimodal vision-language models, it remains unclear whether these systems are capable of accurately generating and interpreting scenes involving the composition of multiple objects and relations. In this work, we present an evaluation of the compositional visual processing capabilities in the current generation of text-to-image (DALL-E 3) and multimodal vision-language models (GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, QWEN2-VL-72B, and InternVL2.5-38B), and compare the performance of these systems to human participants. The results suggest that these systems display some ability to solve compositional and relational tasks, showing notable improvements over the previous generation of multimodal models, but with performance nevertheless well below the level of human participants, particularly for more complex scenes involving many ($>5$) objects and multiple relations. These results highlight the need for further progress toward compositional understanding of visual scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods that rely solely on code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on AI-based code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining code and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing Object Orientation Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models through Egocentric Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16761v2)** | 2025-03-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.16761v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) act as essential interfaces, connecting humans with AI technologies in multimodal applications. However, current MLLMs face challenges in accurately interpreting object orientation in images due to inconsistent orientation annotations in training data, hindering the development of a coherent orientation understanding. To overcome this, we propose egocentric instruction tuning, which aligns MLLMs' orientation understanding with the user's perspective, based on a consistent annotation standard derived from the user's egocentric viewpoint. We first generate egocentric instruction data that leverages MLLMs' ability to recognize object details and applies prior knowledge for orientation understanding. Using this data, we perform instruction tuning to enhance the model's capability for accurate orientation interpretation. In addition, we introduce EgoOrientBench, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' orientation understanding across three tasks using images collected from diverse domains. Experimental results on this benchmark show that egocentric instruction tuning significantly improves orientation understanding without compromising overall MLLM performance.

To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p></details> |  |

However, with the advent of modern communication technologies such as Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS), traffic data collection has outpaced traditional methods, introducing new challenges in random missing value imputation and increasing demands for spatiotemporal dependency modelings. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal traffic imputation method, Multimode Nonlinear Transformed Tensor Nuclear Norm (MNT-TNN), grounded in the Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm (TTNN) optimization framework which exhibits efficient mathematical representations and theoretical guarantees for the recovery of random missing values. Specifically, we strictly extend the single-mode transform in TTNN to a multimode transform with nonlinear activation, effectively capturing the intrinsic multimode spatiotemporal correlations and low-rankness of the traffic tensor, represented as location $\times$ location $\times$ time. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. We suggest an Augmented Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm Families (ATTNNs) framework to enhance the imputation results of TTNN techniques, especially at very high miss rates. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed MNT-TNN and ATTNNs can outperform the compared state-of-the-art imputation methods, completing the benchmark of random missing traffic value imputation.</p></details> |  |

Existing CPR datasets rely on costly human annotations or heuristic-based rule generation, both of which limit scalability and diversity. In this work, we introduce AutoComPose, the first framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to automatically generate rich and structured pose transition descriptions. Our method enhances annotation quality by structuring transitions into fine-grained body part movements and introducing mirrored/swapped variations, while a cyclic consistency constraint ensures logical coherence between forward and reverse transitions. To advance CPR research, we construct and release two dedicated benchmarks, AIST-CPR and PoseFixCPR, supplementing prior datasets with enhanced attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training retrieval models with AutoComPose yields superior performance over human-annotated and heuristic-based methods, significantly reducing annotation costs while improving retrieval quality. Our work pioneers the automatic annotation of pose transitions, establishing a scalable foundation for future CPR research.</p></details> |  |

However, lack of user-specific knowledge still restricts their application in human's daily life. In this paper, we introduce the Retrieval Augmented Personalization (RAP) framework for MLLMs' personalization. Starting from a general MLLM, we turn it into a personalized assistant in three steps. (a) Remember: We design a key-value database to store user-related information, e.g., user's name, avatar and other attributes. (b) Retrieve: When the user initiates a conversation, RAP will retrieve relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever. (c) Generate: The input query and retrieved concepts' information are fed into MLLMs to generate personalized, knowledge-augmented responses. Unlike previous methods, RAP allows real-time concept editing via updating the external database. To further improve generation quality and alignment with user-specific information, we design a pipeline for data collection and create a specialized dataset for personalized training of MLLMs. Based on the dataset, we train a series of MLLMs as personalized multimodal assistants. By pretraining on large-scale dataset, RAP-MLLMs can generalize to infinite visual concepts without additional finetuning. Our models demonstrate outstanding flexibility and generation quality across a variety of tasks, such as personalized image captioning, question answering and visual recognition.

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types.

We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension.

We conduct a user survey to identify adoption patterns and key challenges users face with such technologies. Despite a high adoption rate of these models, our findings highlight concerns related to contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, and complex scene understanding, particularly for individuals who may rely solely on them for visual interpretation. Informed by these results, we collate five user-centred tasks with image and video inputs, including a novel task on Optical Braille Recognition. Our systematic evaluation of twelve MLLMs reveals that further advancements are necessary to overcome limitations related to cultural context, multilingual support, Braille reading comprehension, assistive object recognition, and hallucinations.

However, effectively managing uncertainty - arising from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities - is crucial for reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models in uncertainty-based conflict detection.</p></details> |  |

While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM capabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering crucial generalized reasoning abilities. Although reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise in overcoming these limitations, it encounters two significant challenges: (1) its generalized capacities in multimodal tasks remain largely unexplored, and (2) its training constraints, including the constant Kullback-Leibler divergence or the clamp strategy, often result in suboptimal bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose OThink-MR1, an advanced MLLM equipped with profound comprehension and reasoning capabilities across multimodal tasks. Specifically, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D), which markedly enhances reinforcement learning (RL) performance. For Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, GRPO-D achieves a relative improvement of more than 5.72% over SFT and more than 13.59% over GRPO in same-task evaluation on two adapted datasets. Furthermore, GRPO-D demonstrates remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities, with an average relative improvement of more than 61.63% over SFT in cross-task evaluation. These results highlight that the MLLM trained with GRPO-D on one multimodal task can be effectively transferred to another task, underscoring the superior generalized reasoning capabilities of our proposed OThink-MR1 model.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Jointly training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.</p></details> |  |

This approach integrates multimodal data to deeply explore the diverse factors influencing housing prices. Furthermore, multimodal machine learning significantly outperforms single-modality or fewer-modality approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, with enhanced interpretability. However, systematic and comprehensive survey work on the application in the real estate domain is still lacking. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by reviewing the research efforts.

Subsequently, we explain the concept of multimodal machine learning and provide a comprehensive classification and definition of modalities used in real estate appraisal for the first time. To ensure clarity, we explore works related to data and techniques, along with their evaluation methods, under the framework of these two research questions. Furthermore, specific application domains are summarized. Finally, we present insights into future research directions including multimodal complementarity, technology and modality contribution.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

These models combine various data modalities, such as optical, radar, and LiDAR imagery, with textual and geographic information, enabling more comprehensive analysis and understanding of remote sensing data. The integration of multiple modalities allows for improved performance in tasks like object detection, land cover classification, and change detection, which are often challenged by the complex and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain. The diversity in data types, the need for large-scale annotated datasets, and the complexity of multimodal fusion techniques pose significant obstacles to the effective deployment of these models.

In this work, we take inspiration from masked image modelling (MIM) that learns rich semantics via a mask-and-reconstruct pre-training and its successful extension to masked autoregressive (MAR) image generation. A preliminary study on the MAR encoder's representation reveals exceptional linear probing accuracy and precise feature response to visual concepts, which indicates MAR's potential for visual understanding tasks beyond its original generation role. Based on these insights, we present \emph{Harmon}, a unified autoregressive framework that harmonizes understanding and generation tasks with a shared MAR encoder. Through a three-stage training procedure that progressively optimizes understanding and generation capabilities, Harmon achieves state-of-the-art image generation results on the GenEval, MJHQ30K and WISE benchmarks while matching the performance of methods with dedicated semantic encoders (e.g., Janus) on image understanding benchmarks. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/wusize/Harmon.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |

By 2030, urban farming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and vertical farming, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2024 to 2030, according to market reports. This growth is fueled by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, sustainable innovations such as smart growing systems, and the rising interest in green interior design. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates computer vision, machine learning (ML), and environmental sensing for the automated monitoring of plant health and growth. Unlike previous approaches, this framework combines RGB imagery, plant phenotyping data, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, to predict plant water stress in a controlled growth environment. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras to extract phenotypic features, such as RGB, plant area, height, and width while employing the Lag-Llama time series model to analyze and predict water stress. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RGB, size ratios, and environmental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with the Fine-tuned model achieving the lowest errors (MSE = 0.420777, MAE = 0.595428) and reduced uncertainty. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data and intelligent systems to automate plant care, optimize resource consumption, and align indoor gardening with sustainable building management practices, paving the way for resilient, green urban spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering (i3ce)</p></details> |

Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical question remains unaddressed: do MLLMs perceive visual information similarly to humans? Current benchmarks lack the ability to evaluate MLLMs from this perspective. To address this challenge, we introduce HVSBench, a large-scale benchmark designed to assess the alignment between MLLMs and the human visual system (HVS) on fundamental vision tasks that mirror human vision. HVSBench curated over 85K multimodal samples, spanning 13 categories and 5 fields in HVS, including Prominence, Subitizing, Prioritizing, Free-Viewing, and Searching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. Specifically, we evaluate 13 MLLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. Our experiments reveal that HVSBench presents a new and significant challenge for cutting-edge MLLMs. Diverse human participants attained strong performance, significantly outperforming MLLMs, which further underscores the benchmark's high quality. We believe that HVSBench will facilitate research on human-aligned and explainable MLLMs, marking a key step in understanding how MLLMs perceive and process visual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiaying.link/HVSBench/</p></details> |

We introduce MAVERIX~(Multimodal Audio-Visual Evaluation Reasoning IndeX), a novel benchmark with 700 videos and 2,556 questions explicitly designed to evaluate multimodal models through tasks that necessitate close integration of video and audio information. MAVERIX uniquely provides models with audiovisual tasks, closely mimicking the multimodal perceptual experiences available to humans during inference and decision-making processes. To our knowledge, MAVERIX is the first benchmark aimed explicitly at assessing comprehensive audiovisual integration. Experiments with state-of-the-art models, including Gemini 1.5 Pro and o1, show performance approaching human levels (around 70% accuracy), while human experts reach near-ceiling performance (95.1%). With standardized evaluation protocols, a rigorously annotated pipeline, and a public toolkit, MAVERIX establishes a challenging testbed for advancing audiovisual multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, code is available at https://github.com/altndrr/lmms-owc</p></details> |

This dataset offers comprehensive task coverage, diverse modalities, and rich image-text data. Building upon this dataset, we develop GMAI-VL, a general medical vision-language model, with a three-stage training strategy that enhances the integration of visual and textual information. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to process multimodal data, supporting accurate diagnoses and clinical decision-making.

Traditional ReID methods rely on unimodal inputs, typically images, but face limitations due to challenges like occlusions, lighting changes, and pose variations. While advancements in image-based and text-based ReID systems have been made, the integration of both modalities has remained under-explored. This paper presents FusionSegReID, a multimodal model that combines both image and text inputs for enhanced ReID performance. By leveraging the complementary strengths of these modalities, our model improves matching accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex, real-world scenarios where one modality may struggle. Our experiments show significant improvements in Top-1 accuracy and mean Average Precision (mAP) for ReID, as well as better segmentation results in challenging scenarios like occlusion and low-quality images. Ablation studies further confirm that multimodal fusion and segmentation modules contribute to enhanced re-identification and mask accuracy. The results show that FusionSegReID outperforms traditional unimodal models, offering a more robust and flexible solution for real-world person ReID tasks.</p></details> |  |

With video feature, text, character bank and context information as inputs, the generated ADs are able to correspond to the characters by name and provide reasonable, contextual descriptions to help audience understand the storyline of movie. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage pre-trained foundation models through a simple and unified framework to generate ADs with interleaved multimodal sequence as input, termed as Uni-AD. To enhance the alignment of features across various modalities with finer granularity, we introduce a simple and lightweight module that maps video features into the textual feature space. Moreover, we also propose a character-refinement module to provide more precise information by identifying the main characters who play more significant roles in the video context. With these unique designs, we further incorporate contextual information and a contrastive loss into our architecture to generate smoother and more contextually appropriate ADs. Experiments on multiple AD datasets show that Uni-AD performs well on AD generation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

While existing methods are primarily text-based, the rise of social media highlights the need for multimodal analysis, incorporating text, images, and audio. However, the lack of multimodal datasets for euphemisms limits further research. To address this, we regard euphemisms and their corresponding target keywords as keywords and first introduce a keyword-oriented multimodal corpus of euphemisms (KOM-Euph), involving three datasets (Drug, Weapon, and Sexuality), including text, images, and speech. We further propose a keyword-oriented multimodal euphemism identification method (KOM-EI), which uses cross-modal feature alignment and dynamic fusion modules to explicitly utilize the visual and audio features of the keywords for efficient euphemism identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KOM-EI outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language models, and show the importance of our multimodal datasets.</p></details> |  |

Knots are a primary factor affecting the quality of sawn timber, making their detection fundamental to any timber grading or cutting optimization system. While X-ray computed tomography provides accurate knot locations and internal structures, it is often too slow or expensive for practical use. An attractive alternative is to use fast and cost-effective log surface measurements, such as laser scanners or RGB cameras, to detect surface knots and estimate the internal structure of wood. However, due to the small size of knots and noise caused by factors, such as bark and other natural variations, detection accuracy often remains low when only one measurement modality is used. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using a data fusion pipeline consisting of separate streams for RGB and point cloud data, combined by a late fusion module, higher knot detection accuracy can be achieved compared to using either modality alone. We further propose a simple yet efficient sawing angle optimization method that utilizes surface knot detections and cross-correlation to minimize the amount of unwanted arris knots, demonstrating its benefits over randomized sawing angles.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

In this process, visual token IDs are incrementally activated and integrated into the training phase, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of unified multimodal learning. Experiments on comprehensive text and image tasks show that UGen achieves a significant overall performance improvement of 13.3% compared to the vanilla unified autoregressive method, and it also delivers competitive results across all tasks against several task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often ignore biological characteristics, such as heterogeneity and sparsity, both within and across modalities, ultimately limiting their adaptability to clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose AdaMHF: Adaptive Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion, a framework designed for efficient, comprehensive, and tailored feature extraction and fusion. AdaMHF is specifically adapted to the uniqueness of medical data, enabling accurate predictions with minimal resource consumption, even under challenging scenarios with missing modalities. Initially, AdaMHF employs an experts expansion and residual structure to activate specialized experts for extracting heterogeneous and sparse features. Extracted tokens undergo refinement via selection and aggregation, reducing the weight of non-dominant features while preserving comprehensive information. Subsequently, the encoded features are hierarchically fused, allowing multi-grained interactions across modalities to be captured. Furthermore, we introduce a survival prediction benchmark designed to resolve scenarios with missing modalities, mirroring real-world clinical conditions. Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets demonstrate that AdaMHF surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, showcasing exceptional performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

However, human emotions are inherently dynamic, influenced not only by an individual's expressions but also by interactions with others, and single-modality approaches often fail to capture their full dynamics. Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) leverages multiple signals but traditionally relies on utterance-level analysis, overlooking the dynamic nature of emotions in conversations. Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) addresses this limitation, yet existing methods struggle to align multimodal features and explain why emotions evolve within dialogues. To bridge this gap, we propose GatedxLSTM, a novel speech-text multimodal ERC model that explicitly considers voice and transcripts of both the speaker and their conversational partner(s) to identify the most influential sentences driving emotional shifts. By integrating Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) for improved cross-modal alignment and employing a gating mechanism to emphasise emotionally impactful utterances, GatedxLSTM enhances both interpretability and performance. Additionally, the Dialogical Emotion Decoder (DED) refines emotion predictions by modelling contextual dependencies. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that GatedxLSTM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source methods in four-class emotion classification. These results validate its effectiveness for ERC applications and provide an interpretability analysis from a psychological perspective.</p></details> |  |

These models jointly handle images, text, video, and audio for various tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and image generation. In this work, we explore discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain, building upon their recent success in text generation. Discrete diffusion models offer several advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity of generated samples, the ability to perform joint multimodal inpainting (across both text and image domains), and greater controllability in generation through guidance. Leveraging these benefits, we present the first Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion (UniDisc) model which is capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images for a variety of downstream tasks. We compare UniDisc to multimodal AR models, performing a scaling analysis and demonstrating that UniDisc outperforms them in terms of both performance and inference-time compute, enhanced controllability, editability, inpainting, and flexible trade-off between inference time and generation quality.

Unlike natural images, their inherently symbolic and abstract nature poses significant challenges for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks conflate perceptual and reasoning tasks, making it difficult to assess whether MLLMs genuinely understand mathematical diagrams beyond superficial pattern recognition. To address this gap, we introduce MATHGLANCE, a benchmark specifically designed to isolate and evaluate mathematical perception in MLLMs. MATHGLANCE comprises 1.2K images and 1.6K carefully curated questions spanning four perception tasks: shape classification, object counting, relationship identification, and object grounding, covering diverse domains including plane geometry, solid geometry, and graphical representations. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals that their ability to understand diagrams is notably limited, particularly in fine-grained grounding tasks. In response, we construct GeoPeP, a perception-oriented dataset of 200K structured geometry image-text pairs explicitly annotated with geometric primitives and precise spatial relationships. Training MLLM on GeoPeP leads to significant gains in perceptual accuracy, which in turn substantially improves mathematical reasoning. Our benchmark and dataset establish critical standards for evaluating and advancing multimodal mathematical understanding, providing valuable resources and insights to foster future MLLM research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.

To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR.

The most typical network parameters, but not the only ones, are $S$, $T$, $ABCD$, $Z$, $Y$ , and $h$ that relate input and output signals in different ways. There exist practical formulas for conversion between them. Due to the development of powerful software tools that can deal efficiently and accurately with higher-order modes in each port, researchers need conversion rules between multimode network parameters. However, the usual way to get each conversion rule is just developing cumbersome algebraic manipulations which, at the end, are useful only for some specific conversion. Here, we propose a general algebraic method to obtain any conversion rule between different multimode network parameters. It is based on the assumption of a state vector space and each conversion rule between network parameters can be interpreted as a simple change of basis.

However, generating coherent, long-form text in images, such as paragraphs in slides or documents, remains a major challenge for current generative models. We present the first work specifically focused on long text image generation, addressing a critical gap in existing text-to-image systems that typically handle only brief phrases or single sentences. Through comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art autoregressive generation models, we identify the image tokenizer as a critical bottleneck in text generating quality. To address this, we introduce a novel text-focused, binary tokenizer optimized for capturing detailed scene text features. Leveraging our tokenizer, we develop \ModelName, a multimodal autoregressive model that excels in generating high-quality long-text images with unprecedented fidelity. Our model offers robust controllability, enabling customization of text properties such as font style, size, color, and alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ModelName~significantly outperforms SD3.5 Large~\cite{sd3} and GPT4o~\cite{gpt4o} with DALL-E 3~\cite{dalle3} in generating long text accurately, consistently, and flexibly. Beyond its technical achievements, \ModelName~opens up exciting opportunities for innovative applications like interleaved document and PowerPoint generation, establishing a new frontier in long-text image generating.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, existing research in the face domain primarily focuses on $\textbf{coarse}$ facial attribute understanding, with limited capacity to handle $\textbf{fine-grained}$ facial attributes and without addressing generation capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace, the first UMM tailored specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation. In general, we train Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace on a self-constructed, specialized dataset utilizing two mutually beneficial diffusion techniques and a two-level mixture-of-experts architecture. Specifically, we first build a large-scale facial dataset, Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K, which contains 130K image-text pairs with one million question-answering pairs that span a wide range of facial attributes. Second, we establish a theoretical connection between discrete diffusion score matching and masked generative models, optimizing both evidence lower bounds simultaneously, which significantly improves the model's ability to synthesize facial details. Finally, we introduce both token-level and sequence-level mixture-of-experts, enabling efficient fine-grained representation learning for both understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments on Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace-130K demonstrate that Uni$\textbf{F}^2$ace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models, achieving superior performance across both understanding and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

To improve the robustness to local nonlinear geometric distortions and noises, we design a new edge structure enhanced feature detector and convolutional feature weighted descriptor, respectively. In addition, FILER overcomes the sensitivity of the frequency-domain information to the rotation angle and achieves rotation invariance.

With the recent advancement of safety alignment via preference-tuning from human feedback, LLMs and MLLMs have been equipped with safety guardrails to yield safe, ethical, and fair responses with regard to harmful inputs. However, despite the significance of safety alignment, research on the vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the unexplored vulnerability of the safety alignment, examining its ability to consistently provide safety guarantees for out-of-distribution(OOD)-ifying harmful inputs that may fall outside the aligned data distribution. Our key observation is that OOD-ifying the vanilla harmful inputs highly increases the uncertainty of the model to discern the malicious intent within the input, leading to a higher chance of being jailbroken. Exploiting this vulnerability, we propose JOOD, a new Jailbreak framework via OOD-ifying inputs beyond the safety alignment. We explore various off-the-shelf visual and textual transformation techniques for OOD-ifying the harmful inputs. Notably, we observe that even simple mixing-based techniques such as image mixup prove highly effective in increasing the uncertainty of the model, thereby facilitating the bypass of the safety alignment. Experiments across diverse jailbreak scenarios demonstrate that JOOD effectively jailbreaks recent proprietary LLMs and MLLMs such as GPT-4 and o1 with high attack success rate, which previous attack approaches have consistently struggled to jailbreak.

While current deep learning models excel at specific tasks like skin cancer diagnosis from dermoscopic images, they struggle to meet the complex, multimodal requirements of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on over 2 million real-world skin disease images from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse benchmarks, including skin cancer screening, risk stratification, differential diagnosis of common and rare skin conditions, lesion segmentation, longitudinal monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models when using only 10% of labeled data. We conducted three reader studies to assess PanDerm's potential clinical utility. PanDerm outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection through longitudinal analysis, improved clinicians' skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% on dermoscopy images, and enhanced non-dermatologist healthcare providers' differential diagnosis by 16.5% across 128 skin conditions on clinical photographs. These results demonstrate PanDerm's potential to improve patient care across diverse clinical scenarios and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.</p></details> | 74 pages; Preprint |

However, acquiring 3D HOI data is challenging due to its complexity and high cost, limiting existing methods to the narrow diversity of object types and interaction patterns in training datasets. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot HOI synthesis framework without relying on end-to-end training on currently limited 3D HOI datasets. The core idea of our method lies in leveraging extensive HOI knowledge from pre-trained Multimodal Models. Given a text description, our system first obtains temporally consistent 2D HOI image sequences using image or video generation models, which are then uplifted to 3D HOI milestones of human and object poses. We employ pre-trained human pose estimation models to extract human poses and introduce a generalizable category-level 6-DoF estimation method to obtain the object poses from 2D HOI images. Our estimation method is adaptive to various object templates obtained from text-to-3D models or online retrieval. A physics-based tracking of the 3D HOI kinematic milestone is further applied to refine both body motions and object poses, yielding more physically plausible HOI generation results. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating open-vocabulary HOIs with physical realism and semantic diversity.</p></details> |  |

While there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic information within large language models, little is currently known about the inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and editing.

However, existing approaches typically quantify task-level output prediction uncertainty without considering epistemic uncertainty at the multimodal feature fusion level, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Additionally, popular uncertainty quantification methods, e.g., Bayesian approximations, remain challenging to deploy in practice due to high computational costs in training and inference. In this paper, we propose HyperDUM, a novel deterministic uncertainty method (DUM) that efficiently quantifies feature-level epistemic uncertainty by leveraging hyperdimensional computing. Our method captures the channel and spatial uncertainties through channel and patch -wise projection and bundling techniques respectively. Multimodal sensor features are then adaptively weighted to mitigate uncertainty propagation and improve feature fusion. Our evaluations show that HyperDUM on average outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms by up to 2.01%/1.27% in 3D Object Detection and up to 1.29% improvement over baselines in semantic segmentation tasks under various types of uncertainties. Notably, HyperDUM requires 2.36x less Floating Point Operations and up to 38.30x less parameters than SOTA methods, providing an efficient solution for real-world autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

This paper investigates the challenge of efficient multitask multimodal data communication in UAV-assisted ISAC systems, in the considered system model, hyperspectral (HSI) and LiDAR data are collected by UAV-mounted sensors for both target classification and data reconstruction at the terrestrial BS. The limited channel capacity and complex environmental conditions pose significant challenges to effective air-to-ground communication. To tackle this issue, we propose a perception-enhanced multitask multimodal semantic communication (PE-MMSC) system that strategically leverages the onboard computational and sensing capabilities of UAVs. In particular, we first propose a robust multimodal feature fusion method that adaptively combines HSI and LiDAR semantics while considering channel noise and task requirements. Then the method introduces a perception-enhanced (PE) module incorporating attention mechanisms to perform coarse classification on UAV side, thereby optimizing the attention-based multimodal fusion and transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PE-MMSC system achieves 5\%--10\% higher target classification accuracy compared to conventional systems without PE module, while maintaining comparable data reconstruction quality with acceptable computational overheads.</p></details> |  |

This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions. To enable fine-grained grounding, we curate a multimodal dataset featuring detailed visually-grounded conversations using a semiautomatic annotation pipeline, resulting in a diverse set of 38k video-QA triplets along with 83k objects and 671k masks.

While existing methods have made significant strides, they often struggle to effectively differentiate and integrate modality-shared and modality-specific information, limiting the performance of multimodal learning. To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical Adaptive Expert for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (HAEMSA), a novel framework that synergistically combines evolutionary optimization, cross-modal knowledge transfer, and multi-task learning. HAEMSA employs a hierarchical structure of adaptive experts to capture both global and local modality representations, enabling more nuanced sentiment analysis. Our approach leverages evolutionary algorithms to dynamically optimize network architectures and modality combinations, adapting to both partial and full modality scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate HAEMSA's superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets. On CMU-MOSEI, HAEMSA achieves a 2.6% increase in 7-class accuracy and a 0.059 decrease in MAE compared to the previous best method. For CMU-MOSI, we observe a 6.3% improvement in 7-class accuracy and a 0.058 reduction in MAE. On IEMOCAP, HAEMSA outperforms the state-of-the-art by 2.84% in weighted-F1 score for emotion recognition.

Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

This introduces new challenges for CD methods, as existing weight-sharing Siamese networks struggle to effectively learn the cross-modal data distribution between optical and SAR images. To address this challenge, we propose a unified MultiModal CD framework, M$^2$CD. We integrate Mixture of Experts (MoE) modules into the backbone to explicitly handle diverse modalities, thereby enhancing the model's ability to learn multimodal data distributions. Additionally, we innovatively propose an Optical-to-SAR guided path (O2SP) and implement self-distillation during training to reduce the feature space discrepancy between different modalities, further alleviating the model's learning burden. We design multiple variants of M$^2$CD based on both CNN and Transformer backbones.

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready.

A classic solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a unified framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> |

This study introduces PSO-UNet, which integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the U-Net architecture for dynamic hyperparameter optimization. Unlike traditional manual tuning or alternative optimization approaches, PSO effectively navigates complex hyperparameter search spaces, explicitly optimizing the number of filters, kernel size, and learning rate. PSO-UNet substantially enhances segmentation performance, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 0.9578 and 0.9523 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.9194 and 0.9097 on the BraTS 2021 and Figshare datasets, respectively. Moreover, the method reduces computational complexity significantly, utilizing only 7.8 million parameters and executing in approximately 906 seconds, markedly faster than comparable U-Net-based frameworks. These outcomes underscore PSO-UNet's robust generalization capabilities across diverse MRI modalities and tumor classifications, emphasizing its clinical potential and clear advantages over conventional hyperparameter tuning methods. Future research will explore hybrid optimization strategies and validate the framework against other bio-inspired algorithms to enhance its robustness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, Gecco 2025 Conference</p></details> |

We present MIRAGE, a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that exploits narrative-driven context and role immersion to circumvent safety mechanisms in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By systematically decomposing the toxic query into environment, role, and action triplets, MIRAGE constructs a multi-turn visual storytelling sequence of images and text using Stable Diffusion, guiding the target model through an engaging detective narrative. This process progressively lowers the model's defences and subtly guides its reasoning through structured contextual cues, ultimately eliciting harmful responses. In extensive experiments on the selected datasets with six mainstream MLLMs, MIRAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving attack success rates by up to 17.5% over the best baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate that role immersion and structured semantic reconstruction can activate inherent model biases, facilitating the model's spontaneous violation of ethical safeguards. These results highlight critical weaknesses in current multimodal safety mechanisms and underscore the urgent need for more robust defences against cross-modal threats.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM</p></details> |

However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain.

Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon, we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process, where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However, based on our observation, this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities, which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue, we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg), a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically, InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window, which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets, achieving superior model performance.

However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.

The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |

In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |

Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption.

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments.

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint.

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing.

Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition.

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |
