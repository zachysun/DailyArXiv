| **[Residual Reservoir Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09925v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09925v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC models.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

In particular, thermal power plants grapple with accurately predicting steam mass flow, which is crucial for operational efficiency and cost reduction. In this study, we use a parallel hybrid neural network architecture that combines a parametrized quantum circuit and a conventional feed-forward neural network specifically designed for time-series prediction in industrial settings to enhance predictions of steam mass flow 15 minutes into the future. Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model. These findings contribute to the broader scientific understanding of how integrating quantum and classical machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world challenges faced by the energy sector, ultimately leading to optimized power plant operations. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first parallel hybrid quantum-classical architecture deployed on a real-world power-plant dataset, illustrating how near-term quantum resources can already augment classical analytics in the energy sector.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09630v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09630v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities: variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However, these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive performance and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Graph Profiling via Structural Divergence for Robust Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09504v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09504v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods -- statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal" and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 5 figures, Submission for ACM TKDD</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Lag Transformer based on Time-Variable-Aware Learning for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16896v2)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2408.16896v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is a key element of big data analytics, commonly found in domains such as finance, healthcare, climate forecasting, and transportation. In large scale real world settings, such data is often high dimensional and multivariate, requiring advanced forecasting methods that are both accurate and interpretable. Although Transformer based models perform well in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), their lack of explainability limits their use in critical applications. To overcome this, we propose Distributed Lag Transformer (DLFormer), a novel Transformer architecture for explainable and scalable MTSF. DLFormer integrates a distributed lag embedding and a time variable aware learning (TVAL) mechanism to structurally model both local and global temporal dependencies and explicitly capture the influence of past variables on future outcomes. Experiments on ten benchmark and real world datasets show that DLFormer achieves state of the art predictive accuracy while offering robust, interpretable insights into variable wise and temporal dynamics. These results highlight ability of DLFormer to bridge the gap between performance and explainability, making it highly suitable for practical big data forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Contrastive-Generative Framework for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09451v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09451v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements, with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE, respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the code shortly.</p></details> |  |

Focusing resources on the causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and computation speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper in 32nd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Dual Signal Decomposition of Stochastic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05915v2)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.05915v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The decomposition of a stochastic time series into three component series representing a dual signal - namely, the mean and dispersion - while isolating noise is presented. The decomposition is performed by applying machine learning techniques to fit the dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises between fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the dual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order derivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the regularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on Statistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be applied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time series. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a denoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been considered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal first and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly. Jointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with heteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear unconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have sequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function hyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic process without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the hyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states by stepped signal or smoothed series. The decomposed dual signal can be represented on the 2D space and used to learn inherent structures, to forecast both mean and dispersion, or to analyze cross effects in case of multiple time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[LEAVES: Learning Views for Time-Series Biobehavioral Data in Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07340v2)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2210.07340v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has been utilized as a promising self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data. The majority of these methods take advantage of data-augmentation techniques to create diverse views from the original input. However, optimizing augmentations and their parameters for generating more effective views in contrastive learning frameworks is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. While several strategies have been proposed for automatically generating new views in computer vision, research in other domains, such as time-series biobehavioral data, remains limited. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet powerful module for automatic view generation in contrastive learning frameworks applied to time-series biobehavioral data, which is essential for modern health care, termed learning views for time-series data (LEAVES). This proposed module employs adversarial training to learn augmentation hyperparameters within contrastive learning frameworks. We assess the efficacy of our method on multiple time-series datasets using two well-known contrastive learning frameworks, namely SimCLR and BYOL. Across four diverse biobehavioral datasets, LEAVES requires only approximately 20 learnable parameters -- dramatically fewer than the about 580k parameters demanded by frameworks like ViewMaker, a previously proposed adversarially trained convolutional module in contrastive learning, while achieving competitive and often superior performance to existing baseline methods. Crucially, these efficiency gains are obtained without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning, which makes LEAVES particularly suitable for large-scale or real-time healthcare applications that demand both accuracy and practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synaptic Pruning: A Biological Inspiration for Deep Learning Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09330v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09330v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology by progressively removing low-importance connections during training. Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01). In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models. This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to conventional dropout techniques.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ABIDES-Economist: Agent-Based Simulator of Economic Systems with Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09563v2)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.09563v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ABIDES-Economist, an agent-based simulator for economic systems that includes heterogeneous households, firms, a central bank, and a government. Agent behavior can be defined using domain-specific behavioral rules or learned through reinforcement learning by specifying their objectives. We integrate reinforcement learning capabilities for all agents using the OpenAI Gym environment framework for the multi-agent system. To enhance the realism of our model, we base agent parameters and action spaces on economic literature and real U.S. economic data. To tackle the challenges of calibrating heterogeneous agent-based economic models, we conduct a comprehensive survey of stylized facts related to both microeconomic and macroeconomic time series data. We then validate ABIDES-Economist by demonstrating its ability to generate simulated data that aligns with the relevant stylized facts for the economic scenario under consideration, following the learning of all agent behaviors via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we train our economic agents' policies under two broad configurations. The first configuration demonstrates that the learned economic agents produce system data consistent with macroeconomic and microeconomic stylized facts. The second configuration illustrates the utility of the validated simulation platform in designing regulatory policies for the central bank and government. These policies outperform standard rule-based approaches from the literature, which often overlook agent heterogeneity, shocks, and agent adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version of arXiv:2402.09563 with a survey of stylized facts for validating economic agent-based models, along with experiments showcasing the utility of our simulator for economic policy</p></details> |
| **[Fre-CW: Targeted Attack on Time Series Forecasting using Frequency Domain Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08955v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.08955v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series forecasting datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stationarity Exploration for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08919v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.08919v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns. However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet) that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities, thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v2)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.01687v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Mixture of Experts for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08825v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.08825v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing. Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters. Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |

These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with uniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile environments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput prediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation algorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series architectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse real-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client heterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction performance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities, convergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently delivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM and Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2 scores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM, they require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher context dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end applicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into a live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and Transformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively, over FedAvg, while also reducing the variance. These findings offer actionable insights for building scalable, privacy-preserving, and edge-aware throughput prediction systems in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 24 figures, submitted to IEEE TNET</p></details> |

In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by presenting a comparative evaluation of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing comparative evaluations in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although evaluated IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the evaluated methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables.

However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

ME analysis requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels, leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/ME-TST.</p></details> |  |

But moving all consumer-level usage data to the cloud for predictions and analysis at fine time scales can expose activity patterns. Federated Learning~(FL) is a privacy-sensitive collaborative DNN training approach that retains data on edge devices, trains the models on private data locally, and aggregates the local models in the cloud. But key challenges exist: (i) clients can have non-independently identically distributed~(non-IID) data, and (ii) the learning should be computationally cheap while scaling to 1000s of (unseen) clients. In this paper, we develop and evaluate several optimizations to FL training across edge and cloud for time-series demand forecasting in micro-grids and city-scale utilities using DNNs to achieve a high prediction accuracy while minimizing the training cost. We showcase the benefit of using exponentially weighted loss while training and show that it further improves the prediction of the final model. Finally, we evaluate these strategies by validating over 1000s of clients for three states in the US from the OpenEIA corpus, and performing FL both in a pseudo-distributed setting and a Pi edge cluster. The results highlight the benefits of the proposed methods over baselines like ARIMA and DNNs trained for individual consumers, which are not scalable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07948v1)** | 2025-08-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.07948v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future validations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances deep neural network (DNN) performance by leveraging specialized model adaptation and selection. Initially, a base DNN is trained offline on historical time series data. A reserved validation subset is then segmented to extract and cluster the most dominant patterns within the series, thereby identifying distinct regimes. For each identified cluster, the base DNN is fine-tuned to produce a specialized version that captures unique pattern characteristics. At inference, the most recent input is matched against the cluster centroids, and the corresponding fine-tuned version is deployed based on the closest similarity measure. Additionally, our approach integrates a concept drift detection mechanism to identify and adapt to emerging patterns caused by non-stationary behavior. The proposed framework is generalizable across various DNN architectures and has demonstrated significant performance gains on both traditional DNNs and recent advanced architectures implemented in the GluonTS library.</p></details> |  |

We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.</p></details> |  |

We investigate state-space systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality, stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic regimes.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a reservoir-augmented masked autoencoding transformer (RA-MAT). This time series foundation model employs echo state network (ESN) computing with masked autoencoding to satisfy the stringent latency, energy efficiency, and scalability requirements of 6G O-RAN testing. A fixed, randomly initialized ESN rapidly projects each temporal patch into a rich dynamical embedding without backpropagation through time, converting the quadratic self-attention bottleneck into a lightweight linear operation. These embeddings drive a patch-wise masked autoencoder that reconstructs 30% randomly masked patches, compelling the encoder to capture both local dynamics and long-range structure from unlabeled data. After self-supervised pre-training, RA-MAT is fine-tuned with a shallow task head while keeping the reservoir and most transformer layers frozen, enabling low-footprint adaptation to diverse downstream tasks such as O-RAN KPI forecasting. In a comprehensive O-RAN KPI case study, RA-MAT achieved sub-0.06 mean squared error (MSE) on several continuous and discrete KPIs. This work positions RA-MAT as a practical pathway toward real-time, foundation-level analytics in future 6G networks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research, also presented at the Causal Inference for Time Series Data Workshop at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (CI4TS 2024)</p></details> |

Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |

However, existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness. Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent and efficient maritime traffic management.</p></details> |  |

Methods such as N-BEATS, which is built on stacks of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) blocks, have achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and competitions. N-BEATS is also more interpretable relative to other deep learning approaches, as it decomposes forecasts into different time series components, such as trend and seasonality. In this work, we present N-BEATS-MOE, an extension of N-BEATS based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer. N-BEATS-MOE employs a dynamic block weighting strategy based on a gating network which allows the model to better adapt to the characteristics of each time series. We also hypothesize that the gating mechanism provides additional interpretability by identifying which expert is most relevant for each series. We evaluate our method across 12 benchmark datasets against several approaches, achieving consistent improvements on several datasets, especially those composed of heterogeneous time series.</p></details> |  |

The previously developed Multimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two independent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are combined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other as a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of individual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the model to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this study, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to directly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By constructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose weights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and cluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an optimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final prediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method improves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble coherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical characteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights. In addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always outperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and consistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach is model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other forecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical, physical, or hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their direct application to time series forecasting remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the inherent heterogeneity of temporal patterns and the modality gap between continuous numerical signals and discrete language representations. In this work, we propose TALON, a unified framework that enhances LLM-based forecasting by modeling temporal heterogeneity and enforcing semantic alignment. Specifically, we design a Heterogeneous Temporal Encoder that partitions multivariate time series into structurally coherent segments, enabling localized expert modeling across diverse temporal patterns. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a Semantic Alignment Module that aligns temporal features with LLM-compatible representations, enabling effective integration of time series into language-based models while eliminating the need for handcrafted prompts during inference. Extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all datasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\% over recent state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the effectiveness of incorporating both pattern-aware and semantic-aware designs when adapting LLMs for time series forecasting.

This study presents the first comprehensive review of large-scale, pixel-wise crop mapping workflows, encompassing both conventional supervised methods and emerging transfer learning approaches. To identify the optimal time-series generation approaches and supervised crop mapping models, we conducted systematic experiments, comparing six widely adopted satellite image-based preprocessing methods, alongside eleven supervised pixel-wise classification models. Additionally, we assessed the synergistic impact of varied training sample sizes and variable combinations. Moreover, we identified optimal transfer learning techniques for different magnitudes of domain shift. The evaluation of optimal methods was conducted across five diverse agricultural sites. Landsat 8 served as the primary satellite data source. Labels come from CDL trusted pixels and field surveys. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, fine-scale interval preprocessing paired with Transformer models consistently delivered optimal performance for both supervised and transferable workflows. RF offered rapid training and competitive performance in conventional supervised learning and direct transfer to similar domains. Second, transfer learning techniques enhanced workflow adaptability, with UDA being effective for homogeneous crop classes while fine-tuning remains robust across diverse scenarios. Finally, workflow choice depends heavily on the availability of labeled samples. With a sufficient sample size, supervised training typically delivers more accurate and generalizable results. Below a certain threshold, transfer learning that matches the level of domain shift is a viable alternative to achieve crop mapping.

Given that the typical data (i.e., videos and images) collected by the fleet of UAVs deployed in such scenarios can be considerably larger than what the onboard computers can process, the UAVs need to offload their data in real-time to the edge and the cloud for further processing. To that end, we present the design of AerialDB - a lightweight decentralized data storage and query system that can store and process time series data on a multi-UAV system comprising: A) a fleet of hundreds of UAVs fitted with onboard computers, and B) ground-based edge servers connected through a cellular link. Leveraging lightweight techniques for content-based replica placement and indexing of shards, AerialDB has been optimized for efficient processing of different possible combinations of typical spatial and temporal queries performed by real-world disaster management applications. Using containerized deployment spanning up to 400 drones and 80 edges, we demonstrate that AerialDB is able to scale efficiently while providing near real-time performance with different realistic workloads. Further, AerialDB comprises a decentralized and locality-aware distributed execution engine which provides graceful degradation of performance upon edge failures with relatively low latency while processing large spatio-temporal data. AerialDB exhibits comparable insertion performance and 100 times improvement in query performance against state-of-the-art baseline. Moreover, it exhibits a 10 times and 100 times improvement with insertion and query workloads respectively over the cloud baseline.</p></details> |  |

While recent deep learning models have improved predictive capabilities, they often overlook time-lagged cross-correlations between related sequences, which are crucial for capturing complex temporal relationships. To address this, we propose the Time-Lagged Cross-Correlations-based Sequence Prediction framework (TLCCSP), which enhances forecasting accuracy by effectively integrating time-lagged cross-correlated sequences. TLCCSP employs the Sequence Shifted Dynamic Time Warping (SSDTW) algorithm to capture lagged correlations and a contrastive learning-based encoder to efficiently approximate SSDTW distances. Experimental results on weather, finance and real estate time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. On the weather dataset, SSDTW reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 16.01% compared with single-sequence methods, while the contrastive learning encoder (CLE) further decreases MSE by 17.88%. On the stock dataset, SSDTW achieves a 9.95% MSE reduction, and CLE reduces it by 6.13%. For the real estate dataset, SSDTW and CLE reduce MSE by 21.29% and 8.62%, respectively. Additionally, the contrastive learning approach decreases SSDTW computational time by approximately 99%, ensuring scalability and real-time applicability across multiple time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

The discrete Fr\'echet distance $d_{dF}(x,y)$ is a distance measure between two time series $x$ and $y$ of possibly different complexity. Given a set of $n$ time series represented as $m$-dimensional vectors over the reals, the $(k,\ell)$-median problem under discrete Fr\'echet distance aims to find a set $C$ of $k$ time series of complexity $\ell$ such that $$\sum_{x\in P} \min_{c\in C} d_{dF}(x,c)$$ is minimized. In this paper, we give the first near-linear time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this problem when $\ell$ and $\varepsilon$ are constants but $k$ can be as large as $\Omega(n)$. We obtain our result by introducing a new dimension reduction technique for discrete Fr\'echet distance and then adapt an algorithm of Cohen-Addad et al. (J. ACM 2021) to work on the dimension-reduced input. As a byproduct we also improve the best coreset construction for $(k,\ell)$-median under discrete Fr\'echet distance (Cohen-Addad et al., SODA 2025) and show that its size can be independent of the number of input time series \emph{ and } their complexity.</p></details> |  |

While the heterogeneous nature of involved data modalities may necessitate the design of complex architectures, the model interpretability is often overlooked. In this study, we leverage the intrinsic explainability of Transformer-based models to explain multimodal learning networks, focusing on the task of crop yield prediction at the subfield level. The large datasets used cover various crops, regions, and years, and include four different input modalities: multispectral satellite and weather time series, terrain elevation maps and soil properties. Based on the self-attention mechanism, we estimate feature attributions using two methods, namely the Attention Rollout (AR) and Generic Attention (GA), and evaluate their performance against Shapley-based model-agnostic estimations, Shapley Value Sampling (SVS). Additionally, we propose the Weighted Modality Activation (WMA) method to assess modality attributions and compare it with SVS attributions. Our findings indicate that Transformer-based models outperform other architectures, specifically convolutional and recurrent networks, achieving R2 scores that are higher by 0.10 and 0.04 at the subfield and field levels, respectively. AR is shown to provide more robust and reliable temporal attributions, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative evaluation, compared to GA and SVS values. Information about crop phenology stages was leveraged to interpret the explanation results in the light of established agronomic knowledge. Furthermore, modality attributions revealed varying patterns across the two methods compared.[...]</p></details> |  |

Zero-shot time-series forecasting (ZSF), particularly valuable in data-scarce scenarios, such as domain transfer or forecasting under extreme conditions, is difficult for traditional models to deal with. While time series pre-trained models (TSPMs) have demonstrated strong performance in ZSF, they often lack mechanisms to dynamically incorporate external knowledge. Fortunately, emerging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising path for injecting such knowledge on demand, yet they are rarely integrated with TSPMs. To leverage the strengths of both worlds, we introduce RAG into TSPMs to enhance zero-shot time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose QuiZSF (Quick Zero-Shot Time Series Forecaster), a lightweight and modular framework that couples efficient retrieval with representation learning and model adaptation for ZSF. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical tree-structured ChronoRAG Base (CRB) for scalable time-series storage and domain-aware retrieval, introduce a Multi-grained Series Interaction Learner (MSIL) to extract fine- and coarse-grained relational features, and develop a dual-branch Model Cooperation Coherer (MCC) that aligns retrieved knowledge with two kinds of TSPMs: Non-LLM based and LLM based. Compared with contemporary baselines, QuiZSF, with Non-LLM based and LLM based TSPMs as base model, respectively, ranks Top1 in 75% and 87.5% of prediction settings, while maintaining high efficiency in memory and inference time.</p></details> |  |

While Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown benefits in modeling complex traffic dependencies, the existing GCN-based approaches cannot fully extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently in a complete manner, proven to yield less accurate results. Besides, as extracting multi-granular features across scales has been a promising strategy across domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting, pioneering studies have attempted to leverage a similar mechanism for spatiotemporal traffic data mining. However, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast forecasts. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by coordinating heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected GCN baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025)</p></details> |

Neural networks process information through artificial neurons, conceptually inspired by patterns of activation in the brain. However, their hierarchical structure and high-dimensional parameter space pose challenges for understanding and controlling training dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize training dynamics in neural networks by representing evolving neural activations as functional connectomes and extracting dynamic signatures of activity throughout training. Our results show that these signatures effectively capture key transitions in the functional organization of the network. Building on this analysis, we propose the use of a time series of functional connectomes as an intrinsic indicator of learning progress, enabling a principled early stopping criterion. Our framework performs robustly across benchmarks and provides new insights into neural network training dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, their sampling initialization, independent of historical data, hinders the capture of temporal dependencies, limiting predictive accuracy. They also treat residuals merely as optimization targets, ignoring that residuals often exhibit meaningful patterns like systematic biases or nontrivial distributional structures. To address these, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM), a novel model-agnostic framework that extends flow matching by integrating outputs from an auxiliary predictive model. This enables learning from the probabilistic structure of prediction residuals, leveraging the auxiliary model's prediction distribution as a source to reduce learning difficulty and refine forecasts. CGFM incorporates historical data as both conditions and guidance, uses two-sided conditional paths (with source and target conditioned on the same history), and employs affine paths to expand the path space, avoiding path crossing without complex mechanisms, preserving temporal consistency, and strengthening distribution alignment. Experiments across datasets and baselines show CGFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, advancing forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In climate science, ensemble datasets are used to capture variability in projections under plausible future conditions including greenhouse and aerosol emissions. Each ensemble model run produces projections that are fundamentally similar yet meaningfully distinct. Understanding this variability among ensemble model runs and analyzing its magnitude and patterns is a vital task for climate scientists. In this paper, we present ClimateSOM, a visual analysis workflow that leverages a self-organizing map (SOM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to support interactive exploration and interpretation of climate ensemble datasets. The workflow abstracts climate ensemble model runs - spatiotemporal time series - into a distribution over a 2D space that captures the variability among the ensemble model runs using a SOM. LLMs are integrated to assist in sensemaking of this SOM-defined 2D space, the basis for the visual analysis tasks. In all, ClimateSOM enables users to explore the variability among ensemble model runs, identify patterns, compare and cluster the ensemble model runs. To demonstrate the utility of ClimateSOM, we apply the workflow to an ensemble dataset of precipitation projections over California and the Northwestern United States. Furthermore, we conduct a short evaluation of our LLM integration, and conduct an expert review of the visual workflow and the insights from the case studies with six domain experts to evaluate our approach and its utility.</p></details> |  |

Traditional static thresholds are easily rendered obsolete by regime shifts, concept drift, or multi-scale changes. To address these challenges, we introduce and empirically evaluate two novel adaptive thresholding frameworks: Segmented Confidence Sequences (SCS) and Multi-Scale Adaptive Confidence Segments (MACS). Both leverage statistical online learning and segmentation principles for local, contextually sensitive adaptation, maintaining guarantees on false alarm rates even under evolving distributions. Our experiments across Wafer Manufacturing benchmark datasets show significant F1-score improvement compared to traditional percentile and rolling quantile approaches. This work demonstrates that robust, statistically principled adaptive thresholds enable reliable, interpretable, and timely detection of diverse real-world anomalies.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel forecast combination method, the movement-prediction-adjusted naive forecast (MPANF), which is designed to improve point forecasts beyond the naive baseline. Specifically, MPANF integrates two forecasting components: a naive forecast and a movement prediction. The final forecast is generated by adjusting the naive forecast with a movement prediction term, the weight of which is the product of two in-sample quantities: one is a coefficient determined from the movement prediction accuracy and the other is the mean absolute increment. The performance of MPANF was evaluated on eight financial time series via standard metrics, including the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE. Under modest movement prediction accuracy slightly above 0.55, MPANF generally outperforms common benchmarks such as the naive forecast, naive forecast with drift, integrated moving average of order (1,1) (IMA(1,1)), and linear regression. These findings suggest that MPANF can serve as an effective second-stage method when reliable movement predictions are available.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3 carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, most of these frameworks do not consider intrinsic relationships between variables in multivariate time series data, thus ignoring the causal relationship among variables and degrading anomaly detection performance. This work proposes a novel framework called CGAD, an entropy Causal Graph for multivariate time series Anomaly Detection. CGAD utilizes transfer entropy to construct graph structures that unveil the underlying causal relationships among time series data. Weighted graph convolutional networks combined with causal convolutions are employed to model both the causal graph structures and the temporal patterns within multivariate time series data. Furthermore, CGAD applies anomaly scoring, leveraging median absolute deviation-based normalization to improve the robustness of the anomaly identification process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets with a 9% average improvement in terms of three different multivariate time series anomaly detection metrics.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Previous methods often adopt black-box modeling of pedestrian interactions, treating all neighbors uniformly. Despite their strong performance, such opaque modeling limits the reliability of predictions in safety-critical real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns (e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training strategy, termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model not only outperforms recent black-box baselines in prediction accuracy, especially under high-density scenarios, but also provides stronger interpretability, achieving a favorable trade-off between reliability and accuracy. Furthermore, the SSOS strategy proves to be effective in improving sequential prediction performance, reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives. Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

A recent shift toward Evaluative AI reframes explanation as a tool for hypothesis testing, but still focuses primarily on operational organizations. We introduce Holistic-XAI (H-XAI), a unified framework that integrates causal rating methods with traditional XAI methods to support explanation as an interactive, multi-method process. H-XAI allows stakeholders to ask a series of questions, test hypotheses, and compare model behavior against automatically constructed random and biased baselines. It combines instance-level and global explanations, adapting to each stakeholder's goals, whether understanding individual decisions, assessing group-level bias, or evaluating robustness under perturbations. We demonstrate the generality of our approach through two case studies spanning six scenarios: binary credit risk classification and financial time-series forecasting. H-XAI fills critical gaps left by existing XAI methods by combining causal ratings and post-hoc explanations to answer stakeholder-specific questions at both the individual decision level and the overall model level.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources with varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in collaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework that reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating heterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally governed by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical infrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the system in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly leveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent reconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data quality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware inference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect inputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for operator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled with hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational constraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology requirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components ensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid, enabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under real-world deployment conditions. The proposed framework is validated using data from over 8000 meters across 3 feeders in Oncor's service territory, demonstrating over 95% accuracy in topology reconstruction and substantial improvements in confidence calibration and computational efficiency relative to baseline methods.</p></details> | 10 pages |

First, the high annotation cost of medical data leads to overfitting in models trained on label-limited, single-center datasets. To address this, we propose incorporating external data from related tasks and leveraging AE-GAN to extract prior knowledge, providing valuable references for downstream tasks. Second, many existing studies employ contrastive learning to derive more generalized medical sequence representations for diagnostic tasks, usually relying on manually designed diverse positive and negative sample pairs. However, these approaches are complex, lack generalizability, and fail to adaptively capture disease-specific features across different conditions. To overcome this, we introduce LMCF (Learnable Multi-views Contrastive Framework), a framework that integrates a multi-head attention mechanism and adaptively learns representations from different views through inter-view and intra-view contrastive learning strategies. Additionally, the pre-trained AE-GAN is used to reconstruct discrepancies in the target data as disease probabilities, which are then integrated into the contrastive learning process. Experiments on three target datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other seven baselines, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare applications such as the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential kernels has been common in GPODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a data-driven variational learning algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows, enabling simultaneous learning and inference of unknown continuous dynamics. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions in posterior inference. By applying normalizing flows in both these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian Gaussian Process ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method effectively captures model uncertainty while improving accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enabled graph topology learning from observed signals, existing methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. To address this gap, we introduce AdaCGP, a sparsity-aware adaptive algorithm for dynamic graph topology estimation from multivariate time series. AdaCGP estimates the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance, and bias. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that AdaCGP consistently outperforms multiple baselines across diverse graph topologies, achieving improvements exceeding 83% in GSO estimation compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining favourable computational scaling properties. Our variable splitting approach enables reliable identification of causal connections with near-zero false alarm rates and minimal missed edges. Applied to cardiac fibrillation recordings, AdaCGP tracks dynamic changes in propagation patterns more effectively than established methods like Granger causality, capturing temporal variations in graph topology that static approaches miss. The algorithm successfully identifies stability characteristics in conduction patterns that may maintain arrhythmias, demonstrating potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and treatment of complex biomedical systems.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other domains, real-world medical data is heterogeneous in nature, limited in size, and sparse due to missing modalities. This significantly limits model performance in clinical prediction tasks. Inspired by clinical workflows, we introduce MedPatch, a multi-stage multimodal fusion architecture, which seamlessly integrates multiple modalities via confidence-guided patching. MedPatch comprises three main components: (i) a multi-stage fusion strategy that leverages joint and late fusion simultaneously, (ii) a missingness-aware module that handles sparse samples with missing modalities, (iii) a joint fusion module that clusters latent token patches based on calibrated unimodal token-level confidence. We evaluated MedPatch using real-world data consisting of clinical time-series data, chest X-ray images, radiology reports, and discharge notes extracted from the MIMIC-IV, MIMIC-CXR, and MIMIC-Notes datasets on two benchmark tasks, namely in-hospital mortality prediction and clinical condition classification. Compared to existing baselines, MedPatch achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work highlights the effectiveness of confidence-guided multi-stage fusion in addressing the heterogeneity of multimodal data, and establishes new state-of-the-art benchmark results for clinical prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing time series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient. We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model, FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to varying input sampling rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2 =0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 5th International Conference on Advanced Algorithms and Neural Networks (AANN)</p></details> |

Creep deformation assessment is essential for designing and operating underground storage facilities for nuclear waste, hydrogen energy, or radioactive materials. Salt rocks, known for their mechanical properties like low porosity, low permeability, high ductility, and exceptional creep and self-healing capacities, were examined using multi-stage triaxial (MSTL) creep data. After resampling, axial strain datasets were recorded at 5--10 second intervals under confining pressure levels ranging from 5 to 35 MPa over 5.8--21 days. Initial analyses, including Seasonal-Trend Decomposition (STL) and Granger causality tests, revealed minimal seasonality and causality between axial strain and temperature data. Further statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, confirmed the stationarity of the data with p-values less than 0.05, and wavelet coherence plot (WCP) analysis indicated repeating trends. A suite of deep neural network (DNN) models (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers (TF)) was utilized and compared against statistical baseline models. Predictive performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Results demonstrated that N-BEATS and TCN models outperformed others across various stress levels, respectively. DNN models, particularly N-BEATS and TCN, showed a 15--20\% improvement in accuracy over traditional analytical models, effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies and patterns.</p></details> |  |

Traditional empirical, physics-based, and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions, global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer, and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics (R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 Pa...</summary><p>37 Pages, 19 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, recent work indicates that incorporating advection into the ML value chain has improved skill for radar-based precipitation nowcasts. However, the generality of this approach and the underlying causes remain unexplored. This study investigates the generality by probing the approach on satellite-based thunderstorm nowcasts for the first time. Resorting to a scale argument, we then put forth an explanation when and why skill improvements can be expected. In essence, advection guarantees that thunderstorm patterns relevant for nowcasting are contained in the receptive field at long forecast times. To test our hypotheses, we train ResU-Nets solving segmentation tasks with lightning observations as ground truth. The input of the Baseline Neural Network (BNN) are short time series of multispectral satellite imagery and lightning observations, whereas the Advection-Informed Neural Network (AINN) additionally receives the Lagrangian persistence nowcast of all input channels at the desired forecast time. Overall, we find only a minor skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN when considering fully averaged scores. However, assessing skill conditioned on forecast time and advection speed, we demonstrate that our scale argument correctly predicts the onset of skill improvement of the AINN over the BNN after 2h forecast time. We confirm that, generally, advection becomes gradually more important with longer forecast times and higher advection speeds. Our work accentuates the importance of considering and incorporating the underlying physical scales when designing ML-based forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables.

By combining tensor networks with variational quantum circuits, we demonstrate the potential of QML to tackle complex time series classification and regression tasks. Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate or univariate regression task in the aeroelasticity domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 Figures, submitted to Quantum Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

While Differential Privacy (DP) provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA, QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes are available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Eye Tracking-Based Modeling of Situational Awareness in Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05025v1)** | 2025-08-07 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.05025v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g., bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved 83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.</p></details> |  |

This problem promises to become more and more relevant as providers like Microsoft allow users to easily create custom LLM "assistants" specialized to particular types of queries. However, some tasks (i.e., queries) may be too specialized and difficult for a single LLM to handle alone. These applications often benefit from breaking down the task into smaller subtasks, each of which can then be executed by a LLM expected to perform well on that specific subtask. For example, in extracting a diagnosis from medical records, one can first select an LLM to summarize the record, select another to validate the summary, and then select another, possibly different, LLM to extract the diagnosis from the summarized record. Unlike existing LLM selection or routing algorithms, this setting requires that we select a sequence of LLMs, with the output of each LLM feeding into the next and potentially influencing its success. Thus, unlike single LLM selection, the quality of each subtask's output directly affects the inputs, and hence the cost and success rate, of downstream LLMs, creating complex performance dependencies that must be learned and accounted for during selection. We propose a neural contextual bandit-based algorithm that trains neural networks that model LLM success on each subtask in an online manner, thus learning to guide the LLM selections for the different subtasks, even in the absence of historical LLM performance data. Experiments on telecommunications question answering and medical diagnosis prediction datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to other LLM selection algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

The field has developed diverse alignment approaches including traditional fine-tuning methods (RLHF, instruction tuning), post-hoc correction systems, and inference-time interventions, each with distinct advantages and limitations. However, the lack of unified evaluation frameworks makes it difficult to systematically compare these paradigms and guide deployment decisions. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation of alignment techniques for LLMs, a comprehensive evaluation framework that provides a systematic comparison across all major alignment paradigms. Our framework assesses methods along four key dimensions: alignment detection, alignment quality, computational efficiency, and robustness. Through experiments across diverse base models and alignment strategies, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying strengths and limitations of current state-of-the-art models, providing valuable insights for future research directions.</p></details> | In submission |

Current vulnerability datasets suffer from issues including label inaccuracy rates of 20-71%, extensive duplication, and poor coverage of critical CWE types. These issues create a significant "generalization gap" where models achieve misleading self-testing performance (measured on held-out data from the same dataset for training) by exploiting spurious correlations rather than learning true vulnerability patterns. Our analysis reveals that many models experience substantial performance drops of up to 33% when evaluated on independent data, with some performing close to random guessing. To address these limitations, we present a three-part solution. First, we introduce a manually curated test dataset, BenchVul, covering the MITRE Top 25 Most Dangerous CWEs. Second, we construct a high-quality training dataset, TitanVul, comprising 38,863 functions by aggregating seven public sources and applying deduplication and validation using a novel multi-agent LLM framework. Third, we propose a Realistic Vulnerability Generation (RVG) framework, which synthesizes context-aware vulnerability examples for underrepresented but critical CWE types through simulated development workflows. Our evaluation shows the strengths of each component in closing the generalization gap. First, BenchVul shows the limitations of self-testing: models trained on existing datasets, such as BigVul and CVEfixes, experience performance drops on BenchVul (from 0.776 to 0.519 and from 0.713 to 0.607). Second, training models on TitanVul demonstrates improved generalization, with model performance increasing from 0.584 when evaluated on the same dataset to 0.767 when tested on BenchVul. Third, supplementing TitanVul with RVG-generated data yields further gains, increasing model performance by 14.0% to 0.874.</p></details> |  |

Difficult and ambiguous tasks cannot easily be collapsed into unitary labels. Prior work has shown that deliberation and discussion improve data quality and preserve diverse perspectives -- however, synchronous deliberation through crowdsourcing platforms is time-intensive and costly. In this work, we create a Socratic dialog system using Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as a deliberation partner in place of other crowdworkers. Against a benchmark of synchronous deliberation on two tasks (Sarcasm and Relation detection), our Socratic LLM encouraged participants to consider alternate annotation perspectives, update their labels as needed (with higher confidence), and resulted in higher annotation accuracy (for the Relation task where ground truth is available). Qualitative findings show that our agent's Socratic approach was effective at encouraging reasoned arguments from our participants, and that the intervention was well-received. Our methodology lays the groundwork for building scalable systems that preserve individual perspectives in generating more representative datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CSCW 2025</p></details> |

While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies, providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting. ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding and interpreting the behavior of such complex models is a challenging task, not to mention the dynamic shifts that may occur during fine-tuning, or due to covariate shift between datasets. In this work, we apply concept-level analysis towards MLLM understanding. More specifically, we propose to map hidden states to interpretable visual and textual concepts. This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output. All in all, we propose a novel, training-free, ready-to-use framework for MLLM behavior interpretability and control.

Consequently, developing a reliable benchmark that effectively evaluates large language models' (LLMs) genuine capabilities in mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge. To address these concerns, we propose RV-Bench, a novel evaluation methodology for Benchmarking LLMs with Random Variables in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we build question-generating functions to produce random variable questions (RVQs), whose background content mirrors original benchmark problems, but with randomized variable combinations, rendering them "unseen" to LLMs. Models must completely understand the inherent question pattern to correctly answer RVQs with diverse variable combinations. Thus, an LLM's genuine reasoning capability is reflected through its accuracy and robustness on RV-Bench. We conducted extensive experiments on over 30 representative LLMs across more than 1,000 RVQs. Our findings propose that LLMs exhibit a proficiency imbalance between encountered and ``unseen'' data distributions. Furthermore, RV-Bench reveals that proficiency generalization across similar mathematical reasoning tasks is limited, but we verified it can still be effectively elicited through test-time scaling.</p></details> |  |

The framework further employs in-context learning to extract migration intents from commit messages to enhance the accuracy of its recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of LibRec, we introduce LibEval, a benchmark designed to assess the performance in the library migration recommendation task. LibEval comprises 2,888 migration records associated with 2,368 libraries extracted from 2,324 Python repositories. Each migration record captures source-target library pairs, along with their corresponding migration intents and intent types. Based on LibEval, we evaluated the effectiveness of ten popular LLMs within our framework, conducted an ablation study to examine the contributions of key components within our framework, explored the impact of various prompt strategies on the framework's performance, assessed its effectiveness across various intent types, and performed detailed failure case analyses.</p></details> |  |

We compute 8 steering vectors, each corresponding to a different social bias axis, such as age, gender, or race, on a training subset of the BBQ dataset and compare the effectiveness of these to 3 additional bias mitigation methods across 4 datasets. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.8% on BBQ, 8.3% on CLEAR-Bias, and 1% on StereoSet, and show improvements over prompting and Self-Debias in all cases, and improvements over fine-tuning in 12 out of 17 evaluations. In addition, steering vectors showed the lowest impact on MMLU scores of the four bias mitigation methods tested. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that they are a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AACL 2025</p></details> |

This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal mental health diagnostics, specifically for detecting depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder through text and audio modalities. Using the E-DAIC dataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can perform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the integration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic accuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics. Our analysis specifically utilizes custom-formulated metrics; Modal Superiority Score and Disagreement Resolvement Score to evaluate how combined modalities influence model performance. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model achieves the highest scores in binary depression classification when using the combined modality, with an F1 score of 0.67 and a Balanced Accuracy (BA) of 77.4%, assessed across the full dataset. These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with the text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Notably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the robustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. To explore the impact of different configurations on model performance, we conduct binary, severity, and multiclass tasks using both zero-shot and few-shot prompts, examining the effects of prompt variations on performance. The results reveal that models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro in text and audio modalities, and GPT-4o mini in the text modality, often surpass other models in balanced accuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UDA: Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment for Pair-wise LLM-as-a-Judge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09724v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09724v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem.

While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech.

While developers invest heavily in alignment finetuning and safety guardrails, researchers continue publishing novel attacks, driving progress through adversarial iteration. This dynamic mirrors a strategic game of continual evolution. However, two major challenges hinder jailbreak development: the high cost of querying top-tier LLMs and the short lifespan of effective attacks due to frequent safety updates. These factors limit cost-efficiency and practical impact of research in jailbreak attacks. To address this, we propose MetaCipher, a low-cost, multi-agent jailbreak framework that generalizes across LLMs with varying safety measures. Using reinforcement learning, MetaCipher is modular and adaptive, supporting extensibility to future strategies. Within as few as 10 queries, MetaCipher achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent malicious prompt benchmarks, outperforming prior jailbreak methods. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation across diverse victim models and benchmarks, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. Warning: This paper contains model outputs that may be offensive or harmful, shown solely to demonstrate jailbreak efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities to enhance the design study process, providing capabilities such as creative problem-solving, data handling, and insightful analysis. However, despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of systematic understanding of how LLMs can effectively assist researchers in visualization-specific design studies. In this paper, we conducted a multi-stage qualitative study to fill this gap, involving 30 design study researchers from diverse backgrounds and expertise levels. Through in-depth interviews and carefully-designed questionnaires, we investigated strategies for utilizing LLMs, the challenges encountered, and the practices used to overcome them. We further compiled and summarized the roles that LLMs can play across different stages of the design study process. Our findings highlight practical implications to inform visualization practitioners, and provide a framework for leveraging LLMs to enhance the design study process in visualization research.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world queries often contain inherent ambiguities, and the interconnected nature of graph structures can amplify these challenges, leading to unintended or incorrect query results. To systematically evaluate LLMs on this front, we propose a taxonomy of graph-query ambiguities, comprising three primary types: Attribute Ambiguity, Relationship Ambiguity, and Attribute-Relationship Ambiguity, each subdivided into Same-Entity and Cross-Entity scenarios. We introduce AmbiGraph-Eval, a novel benchmark of real-world ambiguous queries paired with expert-verified graph query answers. Evaluating 9 representative LLMs shows that even top models struggle with ambiguous graph queries. Our findings reveal a critical gap in ambiguity handling and motivate future work on specialized resolution techniques.</p></details> |  |

We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191v3)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.01191v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We introduce primitive-level vulnerability analysis to identify which jailbreaking techniques are most effective for specific hazard categories. Our collaborative evaluation with trusted third parties from the AI Safety Network demonstrates practical pathways for distributed robustness assessment across the community.</p></details> |  |

To simplify log analysis, template generation methods have been proposed to standardize log formats, transforming unstructured data into structured templates. Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods suffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics or specific log patterns in training sets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation. However, they often struggle with ambiguous, complex, or highly specific log content, which can lead to errors in generating accurate templates. To address these challenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive in-context learning. We first propose an edit-distance-based similarity metric to evaluate log similarity. Then, we introduce a method to select the most informative $k$ unlabeled logs for annotation by considering both the representativeness of the logs and the confidence of LLM predictions. Additionally, we design an adaptive context selection strategy that adaptively selects labeled logs to ensure comprehensive keyword coverage for unlabeled logs. These labeled logs serve as the context for LLMs to better understand the unlabeled logs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of template generation. Extensive experiments on sixteen datasets demonstrate that LLMLog outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in VLDB 2025</p></details> |

Prior research efforts have focused on supporting the decisions of placing log statements, such as where/what to log. With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks such as code completion or generation, automated approaches for generating log statements have gained much momentum. However, the performance of these approaches still has a long way to go. This paper explores enhancing the performance of LLM-based solutions for automated log statement generation by post-training LLMs with a purpose-built dataset. Thus the primary contribution is a novel approach called AUCAD, which automatically constructs such a dataset with information extracting from log-related issues. Researchers have long noticed that a significant portion of the issues in the open-source community are related to log statements. However, distilling this portion of data requires manual efforts, which is labor-intensive and costly, rendering it impractical. Utilizing our approach, we automatically extract log-related issues from 1,537 entries of log data across 88 projects and identify 808 code snippets (i.e., methods) with retrievable source code both before and after modification of each issue (including log statements) to construct a dataset. Each entry in the dataset consists of a data pair representing high-quality and problematic log statements, respectively. With this dataset, we proceed to post-train multiple LLMs (primarily from the Llama series) for automated log statement generation. Both human and experimental evaluations indicate that these models significantly outperform existing LLM-based solutions, thereby validating the efficacy of our method for constructing a post-training dataset to enhance LLM-based log statement generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 16th International Conference on Internetware 2025. 13 pages</p></details> |

Given a user written script, MapStory automatically produces a scene breakdown, which decomposes the text into key map animation primitives such as camera movements, visual highlights, and animated elements. Our system includes a researcher agent that accurately queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these primitive blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators and by an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to creating map-centric stories.</p></details> | <details><summary>UIST ...</summary><p>UIST 2025.

These models enable beneficial applications such as content generation, question and answering (Q&A), programming, and code reasoning. Meanwhile, they also pose serious risks by inadvertently or intentionally producing toxic, offensive, or biased content. This dual role of LLMs, both as powerful tools for solving real-world problems and as potential sources of harmful language, presents a pressing sociotechnical challenge. In this survey, we systematically review recent studies spanning unintentional toxicity, adversarial jailbreaking attacks, and content moderation techniques. We propose a unified taxonomy of LLM-related harms and defenses, analyze emerging multimodal and LLM-assisted jailbreak strategies, and assess mitigation efforts, including reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), prompt engineering, and safety alignment. Our synthesis highlights the evolving landscape of LLM safety, identifies limitations in current evaluation methodologies, and outlines future research directions to guide the development of robust and ethically aligned language technologies.</p></details> |  |

Community search, a fundamental task in graph analysis, aims to identify groups of nodes with dense interconnections, which is crucial for understanding the macroscopic structure of graphs. In this paper, we propose GraphCS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in community search tasks. Our experiments reveal that while LLMs exhibit preliminary potential, they frequently fail to return meaningful results and suffer from output bias. To address these limitations, we introduce CS-Agent, a dual-agent collaborative framework to enhance LLM-based community search. CS-Agent leverages the complementary strengths of two LLMs acting as Solver and Validator. Through iterative feedback and refinement, CS-Agent dynamically refines initial results without fine-tuning or additional training. After the multi-round dialogue, Decider module selects the optimal community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-Agent significantly improves the quality and stability of identified communities compared to baseline methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply LLMs to community search, bridging the gap between LLMs and graph analysis while providing a robust and adaptive solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose \textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data, fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree" reasoning capability by employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints. Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank (e.g., 1.7B) achieves performance comparable to models with four times more parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark, and demonstrates strong competitiveness on the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems.

LLM-Driven Recontextualization of Italian Television Archives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09535v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09535v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547 Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary experimentation.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing model pruning methods address this issue by removing redundant structures (e.g., elements, channels, layers) from the model. However, these methods employ a heuristic pruning strategy, which leads to suboptimal performance. Besides, they also ignore the data characteristics when pruning the model. To overcome these limitations, we propose EvoP, an evolutionary pruning framework for robust LLM inference. EvoP first presents a cluster-based calibration dataset sampling (CCDS) strategy for creating a more diverse calibration dataset. EvoP then introduces an evolutionary pruning pattern searching (EPPS) method to find the optimal pruning pattern. Compared to existing model pruning techniques, EvoP achieves the best performance while maintaining the best efficiency. Experiments across different LLMs and different downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed EvoP, making it a practical and scalable solution for deploying LLMs in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation benchmark GridRoute to assess how LLMs can take advantage of traditional algorithms. We also propose a novel hybrid prompting technique called Algorithm of Thought (AoT), which introduces traditional algorithms' guidance into prompting. Our benchmark evaluates six LLMs ranging from 7B to 72B parameters across various map sizes, assessing their performance in correctness, optimality, and efficiency in grid environments with varying sizes. Our results show that AoT significantly boosts performance across all model sizes, particularly in larger or more complex environments, suggesting a promising approach to addressing path planning challenges.

Most existing methods depend heavily on often unreliable translation tools to bridge the language gap. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labelled data in the target language without the need for translation tools. First, the framework trains an ABSA model to obtain predictions for unlabelled target language data. Next, LLM is prompted to generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art translation-based approaches. The proposed framework also supports generative models, and we show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform smaller multilingual models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics; Volume 1: Long Papers (ACL 2025).

Continual learning (CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning environments.</p></details> |  |

However, due to limitations in the size of the concept bank and the amount of training data, answering queries in the wild is not always effective because of the out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, neither concept-based nor embedding-based search can perform reasoning to consolidate search results for complex queries that include logical and spatial constraints. To address these challenges, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to paraphrase queries using text-to-text (T2T), text-to-image (T2I), and image-to-text (I2T) transformations. These transformations rephrase abstract concepts into simpler terms to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Additionally, complex relationships within a query can be decomposed into simpler sub-queries, improving retrieval performance by effectively fusing the search results of these sub-queries. To mitigate the issue of LLM hallucination, this paper also proposes a novel consistency-based verification strategy to filter out factually incorrect paraphrased queries. Extensive experiments are conducted for ad-hoc video search and known-item search on the TRECVid datasets. We provide empirical insights into how traditionally difficult-to-answer queries can be effectively resolved through query paraphrasing.</p></details> |  |

To evaluate the performance of LLMs in different scenarios, various assessment benchmarks have emerged. However, as most of these benchmarks focus on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning performance of LLMs from large amounts of information. Meanwhile, although LLMs often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction datasets. Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings: Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST), and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT). Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1). The top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation context window of 16k in our LongIns. (2). For the multi-hop reasoning ability of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context windows (less than 4k).</p></details> |  |

However, current techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries, degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds, supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.</p></details> |  |

In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

Existing domain-specific benchmarks primarily focus on the scaling law, relying on massive corpora for supervised fine-tuning or generating extensive question sets for broad coverage. However, the impact of corpus and question-answer (QA) set design on the precision and recall of domain-specific LLMs remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap and demonstrate that the scaling law is not always the optimal principle for benchmark construction in specific domains. Instead, we propose Comp-Comp, an iterative benchmarking framework based on a comprehensiveness-compactness principle. Here, comprehensiveness ensures semantic recall of the domain, while compactness enhances precision, guiding both corpus and QA set construction. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study in a well-renowned university, resulting in the creation of XUBench, a large-scale and comprehensive closed-domain benchmark. Although we use the academic domain as the case in this work, our Comp-Comp framework is designed to be extensible beyond academia, providing valuable insights for benchmark construction across various domains.</p></details> |  |

They continuously generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies, inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model, DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models. These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation smart systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods are primarily based on semantic similarity, overlooking task intent and reducing task coherence in multi-session dialogues. To address this challenge, we introduce MemGuide, a two-stage framework for intent-driven memory selection. (1) Intent-Aligned Retrieval matches the current dialogue context with stored intent descriptions in the memory bank, retrieving QA-formatted memory units that share the same goal. (2) Missing-Slot Guided Filtering employs a chain-of-thought slot reasoner to enumerate unfilled slots, then uses a fine-tuned LLaMA-8B filter to re-rank the retrieved units by marginal slot-completion gain. The resulting memory units inform a proactive strategy that minimizes conversational turns by directly addressing information gaps. Based on this framework, we introduce the MS-TOD, the first multi-session TOD benchmark comprising 132 diverse personas, 956 task goals, and annotated intent-aligned memory targets, supporting efficient multi-session task completion. Evaluations on MS-TOD show that MemGuide raises the task success rate by 11% (88% -> 99%) and reduces dialogue length by 2.84 turns in multi-session settings, while maintaining parity with single-session benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, this efficiency optimization introduces significant yet underexplored privacy risks. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that an attacker can reconstruct sensitive user inputs directly from the KV-cache. We design and implement three distinct attack vectors: a direct Inversion Attack, a more broadly applicable and potent Collision Attack, and a semantic-based Injection Attack. These methods demonstrate the practicality and severity of KV-cache privacy leakage issues. To mitigate this, we propose KV-Cloak, a novel, lightweight, and efficient defense mechanism. KV-Cloak uses a reversible matrix-based obfuscation scheme, combined with operator fusion, to secure the KV-cache. Our extensive experiments show that KV-Cloak effectively thwarts all proposed attacks, reducing reconstruction quality to random noise. Crucially, it achieves this robust security with virtually no degradation in model accuracy and minimal performance overhead, offering a practical solution for trustworthy LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a novel data augmentation framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming strong baselines.</p></details> |  |

Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D.

We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on "emergent misalignment" and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025. 30 pages, 7 figures.

We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods like code reviews and static analysis tools offer limited, inconsistent feedback. Our approach integrates LLM-assisted refactoring into a course project using structured prompts to help students identify and address code smells such as long methods and low cohesion. Implemented in Spring 2025 in a long-lived OSS project, the intervention is evaluated through student feedback and planned analysis of code quality improvements. Findings suggest that LLMs can bridge theoretical and practical learning, supporting a deeper understanding of maintainability and refactoring principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Frontiers in Education Conference, Nashville, Tennessee, USA, 2-5 November 2025</p></details> |

Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models. Mosaic is available for public use from https://github.com/blessonvar/Mosaic</p></details> |  |

While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

These agents address the limitations of their parametric memory by dynamically gathering relevant facts to address complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from a fundamental architectural limitation: they process search queries strictly sequentially, even when handling inherently parallelizable and logically independent comparisons. This sequential bottleneck significantly constrains computational efficiency, particularly for queries that require multiple entity comparisons. To address this critical limitation, we propose ParallelSearch, a novel reinforcement learning framework that empowers large language models (LLMs) to recognize parallelizable query structures and execute multiple search operations concurrently. Our approach introduces dedicated reward functions that incentivize the identification of independent query components while preserving answer accuracy through jointly considering correctness, query decomposition quality, and parallel execution benefits. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ParallelSearch outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average performance gain of 2.9% across seven question-answering benchmarks. Notably, on parallelizable questions, our method achieves a 12.7% performance improvement while requiring only 69.6% of the LLM calls compared to sequential approaches.</p></details> |  |

We present Contextual Integrity Verification (CIV), an inference-time security architecture that attaches cryptographically signed provenance labels to every token and enforces a source-trust lattice inside the transformer via a pre-softmax hard attention mask (with optional FFN/residual gating). CIV provides deterministic, per-token non-interference guarantees on frozen models: lower-trust tokens cannot influence higher-trust representations. On benchmarks derived from recent taxonomies of prompt-injection vectors (Elite-Attack + SoK-246), CIV attains 0% attack success rate under the stated threat model while preserving 93.1% token-level similarity and showing no degradation in model perplexity on benign tasks; we note a latency overhead attributable to a non-optimized data path. Because CIV is a lightweight patch -- no fine-tuning required -- we demonstrate drop-in protection for Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B.

Data augmentation can potentially alleviate the data shortage, but augmenting vulnerable code is challenging and requires a generative solution that maintains vulnerability. Previous works have only focused on generating samples that contain single statements or specific types of vulnerabilities. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to solve various code generation and comprehension tasks with inspiring results, especially when fused with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Therefore, we propose VulScribeR, a novel LLM-based solution that leverages carefully curated prompt templates to augment vulnerable datasets. More specifically, we explore three strategies to augment both single and multi-statement vulnerabilities, with LLMs, namely Mutation, Injection, and Extension. Our extensive evaluation across four vulnerability datasets and DLVD models, using three LLMs, show that our approach beats two SOTA methods Vulgen and VGX, and Random Oversampling (ROS) by 27.48%, 27.93%, and 15.41% in f1-score with 5K generated vulnerable samples on average, and 53.84%, 54.10%, 69.90%, and 40.93% with 15K generated vulnerable samples.

However, effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt, providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on atomic tasks that are self-contained and independent, failing to capture the long-term contextual dependencies and multi-interaction coordination required in realistic scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce OdysseyBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on long-horizon workflows across diverse office applications including Word, Excel, PDF, Email, and Calendar. Our benchmark comprises two complementary splits: OdysseyBench+ with 300 tasks derived from real-world use cases, and OdysseyBench-Neo with 302 newly synthesized complex tasks. Each task requires agent to identify essential information from long-horizon interaction histories and perform multi-step reasoning across various applications. To enable scalable benchmark creation, we propose HomerAgents, a multi-agent framework that automates the generation of long-horizon workflow benchmarks through systematic environment exploration, task generation, and dialogue synthesis. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that OdysseyBench effectively challenges state-of-the-art LLM agents, providing more accurate assessment of their capabilities in complex, real-world contexts compared to existing atomic task benchmarks. We believe that OdysseyBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development and evaluation of LLM agents in real-world productivity scenarios. In addition, we release OdysseyBench and HomerAgents to foster research along this line.</p></details> |  |

This sequential nature makes the inference process inherently difficult to accelerate, posing a significant challenge for efficient deployment. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to address this issue, with the most effective approaches often involving the training of additional draft models. In this paper, we introduce READER (Retrieval-Assisted Drafter for Efficient LLM Inference), a novel lossless speculative decoding method that enhances model-based approaches by leveraging self-repetitions in the text. Our algorithm expands the speculative decoding tree using tokens obtained through statistical search. This work focuses on large batch sizes (>= 8), an underexplored yet important area for industrial applications. We also analyze the key-value (KV) cache size during speculative decoding and propose an optimization to improve performance for large batches. As a result, READER outperforms existing speculative decoding methods. Notably, READER requires no additional training and can reuse pre-trained speculator models, increasing the speedup by over 40\%. Our method demonstrates particularly strong performance on search-based tasks, such as retrieval-augmented generation, where we achieve more than 10x speedup.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, this work shifts towards developing an LLM as a supervisor to train real therapists. In addition to the privacy of clinical therapist training data, a fundamental contradiction complicates the training of therapeutic behaviors: clear feedback standards are necessary to ensure a controlled training system, yet there is no absolute "gold standard" for appropriate therapeutic behaviors in practice. In contrast, many common therapeutic mistakes are universal and identifiable, making them effective triggers for targeted feedback that can serve as clearer evidence. Motivated by this, we create a novel therapist-training paradigm: (1) guidelines for mistaken behaviors and targeted correction strategies are first established as standards; (2) a human-in-the-loop dialogue-feedback dataset is then constructed, where a mistake-prone agent intentionally makes standard mistakes during interviews naturally, and a supervisor agent locates and identifies mistakes and provides targeted feedback; (3) after fine-tuning on this dataset, the final supervisor model is provided for real therapist training. The detailed experimental results of automated, human and downstream assessments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our dataset MATE, can provide high-quality feedback according to the clinical guideline, showing significant potential for the therapist training scenario.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

For privacy professionals, the question is whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance, privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten leading open and closed LLMs, including models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, and DeepSeek, by benchmarking their performance on industry-standard certification exams: CIPP/US, CIPM, CIPT, and AIGP from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP). Each model was tested using official sample exams in a closed-book setting and compared to IAPP's passing thresholds. Our findings show that several frontier models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5 consistently achieve scores exceeding the standards for professional human certification - demonstrating substantial expertise in privacy law, technical controls, and AI governance. The results highlight both the strengths and domain-specific gaps of current LLMs and offer practical insights for privacy officers, compliance leads, and technologists assessing the readiness of AI tools for high-stakes data governance roles. This paper provides an overview for professionals navigating the intersection of AI advancement and regulatory risk and establishes a machine benchmark based on human-centric evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We present a study of LLM fingerprinting from both offensive and defensive perspectives. Our attack methodology uses reinforcement learning to automatically optimize query selection, achieving better fingerprinting accuracy with only 3 queries compared to randomly selecting 3 queries from the same pool. Our defensive approach employs semantic-preserving output filtering through a secondary LLM to obfuscate model identity while maintaining semantic integrity. The defensive method reduces fingerprinting accuracy across tested models while preserving output quality. These contributions show the potential to improve fingerprinting tools capabilities while providing practical mitigation strategies against fingerprinting attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Steering for Bias Mitigation: An Interpretable Approach to Safer LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09019v1)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09019v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems, the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g., gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers. Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique, showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more accountable LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we evaluate uncertainty estimation methods for clinical QA focusing, for the first time, on eleven clinical specialties and six question types, and across ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models). We analyze score-based UQ methods, present a case study introducing a novel lightweight method based on behavioral features derived from reasoning-oriented models, and examine conformal prediction as a complementary set-based approach. Our findings reveal that uncertainty reliability is not a monolithic property, but one that depends on clinical specialty and question type due to shifts in calibration and discrimination. Our results highlight the need to select or ensemble models based on their distinct, complementary strengths and clinical use.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information. We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics: scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textit{NEFMind}, a framework leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges. It integrates three core components: synthetic dataset generation from Network Exposure Function (NEF) API specifications, model optimization through Quantized-Low-Rank Adaptation, and performance evaluation via GPT-4 Ref Score and BertScore metrics. Targeting 5G Service-Based Architecture APIs, our approach achieves 85% reduction in communication overhead compared to manual discovery methods. Experimental validation using the open-source Phi-2 model demonstrates exceptional API call identification performance at 98-100% accuracy. The fine-tuned Phi-2 model delivers performance comparable to significantly larger models like GPT-4 while maintaining computational efficiency for telecommunications infrastructure deployment. These findings validate domain-specific, parameter-efficient LLM strategies for managing complex API ecosystems in next-generation telecommunications networks.</p></details> | 6 pages |

However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable, particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.</p></details> |  |

However, these specifications require significant manual effort to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage over the second best and triggers up to 216.7% more artificially injected bugs, compared to the state-of-the-art. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |

Allowing unrestricted access to LLM or tool resources can lead to inefficient or even potentially harmful resource allocation and utilization for agents. Furthermore, the absence of proper scheduling and resource management mechanisms in current agent designs hinders concurrent processing and limits overall system efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the architecture of AIOS (LLM-based AI Agent Operating System) under the context of managing LLM-based agents. It introduces a novel architecture for serving LLM-based agents by isolating resources and LLM-specific services from agent applications into an AIOS kernel. This AIOS kernel provides fundamental services (e.g., scheduling, context management, memory management, storage management, access control) for runtime agents. To enhance usability, AIOS also includes an AIOS SDK, a comprehensive suite of APIs designed for utilizing functionalities provided by the AIOS kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that using AIOS can achieve up to 2.1x faster execution for serving agents built by various agent frameworks.

They are widely used by leading AI companies as internal tools for red teaming and alignment evaluation. For example, if a safety-aligned model produces harmful outputs similar to an unlimited model, this indicates alignment failures that require further attention. Despite their essential role in assessing alignment, such models are not available to the research community. We introduce Jinx, a helpful-only variant of popular open-weight LLMs. Jinx responds to all queries without refusals or safety filtering, while preserving the base model's capabilities in reasoning and instruction following. It provides researchers with an accessible tool for probing alignment failures, evaluating safety boundaries, and systematically studying failure modes in language model safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://huggingface.co/Jinx-org</p></details> |

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed that some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic parallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel decoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which addresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data and efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a non-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable structures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient adaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which enables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while maintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical Reasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, on Vicuna Bench, our method achieves up to 3.19x speedup (1.85x on average) while maintaining response quality within 1% difference compared to autoregressive models, realizing significant acceleration without compromising generation quality. Our framework sets a groundbreaking benchmark for efficient LLM parallel inference, paving the way for its deployment in latency-sensitive applications such as AI-powered customer service bots and answer retrieval engines.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases, particularly along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we propose a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), our method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.</p></details> | Preprint |

While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI Social Impact 2026</p></details> |

These transformations allow us to measure the sensitivity of LLMs to non-mathematical perturbations, thereby enabling a more accurate evaluation of their mathematical reasoning capabilities. Using this new evaluation methodology, we created PutnamGAP, a new benchmark dataset with multiple mathematically-equivalent variations of competition-level math problems. With the new dataset, we evaluate multiple families of representative LLMs and examine their robustness. Across 18 commercial and open-source models we observe sharp performance degradation on the variants. OpenAI's flagship reasoning model, O3, scores 49 % on the originals but drops by 4 percentage points on surface variants, and by 10.5 percentage points on core-step-based variants, while smaller models fare far worse. Overall, the results show that the proposed new evaluation methodology is effective for deepening our understanding of the robustness of LLMs and generating new insights for further improving their mathematical reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Since retraining is computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative -- modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs. external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods, define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude with open challenges and future directions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact, interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient, profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys '25</p></details> |

DevNous integrates directly into team chat environments, identifying actionable intents from informal dialogue and managing stateful, multi-turn workflows for core administrative tasks like automated task formalization and progress summary synthesis. To quantitatively evaluate the system, we introduce a new benchmark of 160 realistic, interactive conversational turns.

On this benchmark, DevNous achieves an exact match turn accuracy of 81.3\% and a multiset F1-Score of 0.845, providing strong evidence for its viability. The primary contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a validated architectural pattern for developing ambient administrative agents, and (2) the introduction of the first robust empirical baseline and public benchmark dataset for this challenging problem domain.</p></details> |  |

Recently, \textit{two-stage} retrieval-augmented generated large language models (RAG-LLMs) have shown impressive advancements in this domain. Such a two-stage framework, especially the second stage (reranker), is particularly essential in the scientific domain, where subtle differences in terminology may have a greatly negative impact on the final factual-oriented or knowledge-intensive answers. Despite this significant progress, the potential and limitations of these works remain unexplored. In this work, we present a Scientific Rerank-oriented RAG Benchmark (SciRerankBench), for evaluating rerankers within RAG-LLMs systems, spanning five scientific subjects. To rigorously assess the reranker performance in terms of noise resilience, relevance disambiguation, and factual consistency, we develop three types of question-context-answer (Q-C-A) pairs, i.e., Noisy Contexts (NC), Semantically Similar but Logically Irrelevant Contexts (SSLI), and Counterfactual Contexts (CC). Through systematic evaluation of 13 widely used rerankers on five families of LLMs, we provide detailed insights into their relative strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, SciRerankBench is the first benchmark specifically developed to evaluate rerankers within RAG-LLMs, which provides valuable observations and guidance for their future development.</p></details> |  |

However, enhancing these capabilities through post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME 24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient manner.

While machine learning-based insider threat detection (ITD) methods have shown promising results, their progress is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data. Enterprise data is sensitive and rarely accessible, while publicly available datasets, when limited in scale due to cost, lack sufficient real-world coverage; and when purely synthetic, they fail to capture rich semantics and realistic user behavior. To address this, we propose Chimera, the first large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that automatically simulates both benign and malicious insider activities and collects diverse logs across diverse enterprise environments. Chimera models each employee with agents that have role-specific behavior and integrates modules for group meetings, pairwise interactions, and autonomous scheduling, capturing realistic organizational dynamics. It incorporates 15 types of insider attacks (e.g., IP theft, system sabotage) and has been deployed to simulate activities in three sensitive domains: technology company, finance corporation, and medical institution, producing a new dataset, ChimeraLog. We assess ChimeraLog via human studies and quantitative analysis, confirming its diversity, realism, and presence of explainable threat patterns. Evaluations of existing ITD methods show an average F1-score of 0.83, which is significantly lower than 0.99 on the CERT dataset, demonstrating ChimeraLog's higher difficulty and utility for advancing ITD research.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that $\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced reasoning processes.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential, they often struggle with handling ambiguous or domain-specific data, maintaining table structure, managing long inputs, and addressing numerical reasoning. This paper proposes an efficient system for LLM-driven text-to-table generation that leverages novel prompting techniques. Specifically, the system incorporates two key strategies: breaking down the text-to-table task into manageable, guided sub-tasks and refining the generated tables through iterative self-feedback. We show that this custom task decomposition allows the model to address the problem in a stepwise manner and improves the quality of the generated table. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and potential risks associated with iterative self-feedback on the generated tables while highlighting the trade-offs between enhanced performance and computational cost. Our methods achieve strong results compared to baselines on two complex text-to-table generation datasets available in the public domain.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present InternBootcamp, an open-source framework comprising 1000+ domain-diverse task environments specifically designed for LLM reasoning research. Our codebase offers two key functionalities: (1) automated generation of unlimited training/testing cases with configurable difficulty levels, and (2) integrated verification modules for objective response evaluation. These features make InternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing such a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we accelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow supplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to expand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an automatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment. Evaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning tasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to significantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves state-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established benchmarks. In particular, we validate that consistent performance gains come from including more training tasks, namely \textbf{task scaling}, over two orders of magnitude, offering a promising route towards capable reasoning generalist.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>InternBootcamp Tech Report</p></details> |

The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</p></details> |  |

The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.</p></details> |  |

Educator-facing, learner-facing, and institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models (eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs, which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and institutions.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent single-stage methods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled mechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we reframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \textbf{implicit rewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary reward signals. We introduce \textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel single-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit, path-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is a \textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL balance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize long-term task performance. This forward-looking approach, regularized by policy entropy for stability, autonomously discovers an effective training curriculum. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, abstract visual reasoning (General Points), and vision-language navigation (V-IRL). AMFT consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art and demonstrats superior generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Ablation studies and training dynamic analysis confirm that the meta-learning controller is crucial for AMFT's stability, sample efficiency, and performance, offering a more principled and effective paradigm for LLM alignment.

Despite recent advances in enhancing large language model (LLM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LLMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains. Notably, our method achieves significant gains on the Pass@K metric -- an upper-bound estimator of LLM reasoning capabilities -- even when evaluated with extremely large K values, pushing the boundaries of LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be retrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one possible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the semantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation. Semantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic similarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem: one must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached responses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities and serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing semantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations and unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a principled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown query and cost distributions. We formulate both offline optimization and online learning variants of the problem, and develop provably efficient algorithms with state-of-the-art guarantees. We also evaluate our framework on a synthetic dataset, showing that our proposed algorithms perform matching or superior performance compared with baselines.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.</p></details> | content error |

Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05735v2)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.05735v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Traditional user profiling often fails to capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences. This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive, context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset characteristics for practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

Creating LLM-based applications that serve the needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients' social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts, in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose two lightweight DPO-based variants -- Adaptive Margin-Sigmoid Loss and APO-hinge-zero -- to better address underperformance scenarios by introducing margin-based objectives and selective update mechanisms. Our APO-hinge-zero method, which combines hinge-induced hard-example mining with the chosen-focused optimization of APO-zero, achieves strong results. In AlpacaEval, APO-hinge-zero improves the win rate by +2.0 points and the length-controlled win rate by +1.4 points compared to the APO-zero baseline. In MT-Bench, our methods maintain competitive performance in diverse categories, particularly excelling in STEM and Humanities tasks. These results demonstrate that simple modifications to preference-based objectives can significantly enhance small LLM alignment under resource constraints, offering a practical path toward more efficient deployment.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

This work proposes a packing-prefetch scheduling architecture with monolithic 3D (M3D) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible embedded memories with ultra-large on-chip capacity to accelerate long-context LLM inference.

Existing approaches often rely on simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling (LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating natural language representations of user histories using a large language model (LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based recommendation.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles -- a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in two formats (text and image), supports adjustable difficulty through prefill ratio control, and offers different evaluation strategies, ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs substantially outperform non-reasoning models by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings highlight limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.</p></details> |  |

However, it exposes a new class of timing side-channel attacks, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive user inputs via shared cache entries. Existing defenses, such as per-user isolation, eliminate leakage but degrade performance by up to 38.9% in time-to-first-token (TTFT), making them impractical for high-throughput deployment. To address this gap, we introduce SafeKV (Secure and Flexible KV Cache Sharing), a privacy-aware KV-cache management framework that selectively shares non-sensitive entries while confining sensitive content to private caches. SafeKV comprises three components: (i) a hybrid, multi-tier detection pipeline that integrates rule-based pattern matching, a general-purpose privacy detector, and context-aware validation; (ii) a unified radix-tree index that manages public and private entries across heterogeneous memory tiers (HBM, DRAM, SSD); and (iii) entropy-based access monitoring to detect and mitigate residual information leakage. Our evaluation shows that SafeKV mitigates 94% - 97% of timing-based side-channel attacks. Compared to per-user isolation method, SafeKV improves TTFT by up to 40.58% and throughput by up to 2.66X across diverse LLMs and workloads. SafeKV reduces cache-induced TTFT overhead from 50.41% to 11.74% on Qwen3-235B. By combining fine-grained privacy control with high cache reuse efficiency, SafeKV reclaims the performance advantages of global sharing while providing robust runtime privacy guarantees for LLM inference.</p></details> | 17 pages,17 figures |

Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations.

While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to 281 five-person groups completing a hidden profile task--selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event--under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator. Whether by human or AI, there is no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that even substantial but partial increases in information sharing are insufficient to overcome the hidden profile effect studied. To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative decision making, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool.</p></details> |  |

However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization, 1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures, leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025; https://github.com/cszn/ConverseNet</p></details> |

To leverage the global modeling capabilities of transformers and the local modeling capabilities of convolutions, we integrate sole CNNs in the encoder-decoder and sole transformers in the latent layer. Additionally, we design convolutional kernels with selected multi-dimensional dynamic attention to capture diverse degraded inputs efficiently. A transformer block with transposed self-attention further enhances global feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a better balance between performance and computational complexity across five image restoration tasks: deraining, deblurring, denoising, dehazing, and enhancement, as well as superior performance for high-level vision tasks.

However, a critical limitation of existing RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131 LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |

While State-Space Models like Mamba offer proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent 1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images, hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations, our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new paradigm for infrared image restoration.

While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

In particular, recent advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type, resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with only 2.75M parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

However, existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF) scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition, the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205 high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, such as extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component, utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba, which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.</p></details> |  |

This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.</p></details> |  |

The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead.

With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency.

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has strong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a powerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose HOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for degradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware Self-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial dependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG descriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates channel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under diverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance structural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation.

In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

In this study, we propose a novel image restoration network that effectively constrains the restoration process by introducing a Corner Loss, which prevents the loss of object boundaries and detailed texture information during restoration. Furthermore, we propose a Residual Convolutional Block Attention Module (R-CBAM) Block into the encoder and decoder to dynamically adjust the importance of features in both spatial and channel dimensions, enabling the network to focus more effectively on regions heavily affected by rain streaks. Quantitative evaluations conducted on the Rain100L and Rain100H datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving a PSNR of 33.29 dB on Rain100L and 26.16 dB on Rain100H.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Previous TDIR methods struggle to handle practical scenarios in which images are degraded by multiple complex factors, leaving minimal clues for restoration. This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most powerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help generate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details remains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address this, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior to restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging useful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from pixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we employ a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant details that dilute crucial task-related information. We demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes diffusion prior for TDIR, significantly enhancing task performance and visual quality across diverse tasks with multiple complex degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, they face several critical challenges: removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution. Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient and high-quality image restoration.</p></details> |  |

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting reliable artifact maps. The absence of such metrics hinders assessment of the quality of novel views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. To tackle this, recent work has established a new category of metrics (cross-reference), predicting image quality solely by leveraging context from alternate viewpoint captures (arXiv:2404.14409). In this work, we propose a new cross-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the training views to establish a scene-specific distribution, later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. Given the lack of good measures to evaluate cross-reference methods in the context of 3D reconstruction, we collected a novel human-labeled dataset of artifact and distortion maps in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art localization of artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, even without aligned references. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

While significant progress has been made in state estimation methods that utilize visual data in the past decade, most evaluations have been limited to controlled indoor and urban environments, where impressive performance was demonstrated. However, these techniques have not been extensively tested in extremely challenging conditions, such as underwater scenarios where factors such as water and light conditions, robot path, and depth can greatly impact algorithm performance. Hence, our evaluation is conducted in real-world AUV scenarios as well as laboratory settings which provide precise external reference. A focus is laid on understanding the impact of environmental conditions, such as optical properties of the water and illumination scenarios, on the performance of monocular vSLAM methods. To this end, we first show that all methods perform very well in in-air settings and subsequently show the degradation of their performance in challenging underwater environments. The final goal of this study is to identify techniques that can improve accuracy and robustness of SLAM methods in such conditions. To achieve this goal, we investigate the potential of image enhancement techniques to improve the quality of input images used by the SLAM methods, specifically in low visibility and extreme lighting scenarios in scattering media. We present a first evaluation on calibration maneuvers and simple image restoration techniques to determine their ability to enable or enhance the performance of monocular SLAM methods in underwater environments.</p></details> |  |

Especially Transformer-based models, particularly those leveraging window-based self-attention, have become a dominant force in image restoration. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by the rigid, non-overlapping window partitioning scheme, which leads to two critical limitations: insufficient feature interaction across window boundaries and content-agnostic receptive fields that cannot adapt to diverse image structures. Existing methods often rely on heuristic patterns to mitigate these issues, rather than addressing the root cause. In this paper, we propose the Deformable Sliding Window Transformer (DSwinIR), a new foundational backbone architecture that systematically overcomes these limitations. At the heart of DSwinIR is the proposed novel Deformable Sliding Window (DSwin) Attention. This mechanism introduces two fundamental innovations. First, it replaces the rigid partitioning with a token-centric sliding window paradigm, ensuring seamless cross-window information flow and effectively eliminating boundary artifacts. Second, it incorporates a content-aware deformable sampling strategy, which allows the attention mechanism to learn data-dependent offsets and dynamically shape its receptive fields to focus on the most informative image regions. This synthesis endows the model with both strong locality-aware inductive biases and powerful, adaptive long-range modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments show that DSwinIR sets a new state-of-the-art across a wide spectrum of image restoration tasks. For instance, in all-in-one restoration, our DSwinIR surpasses the most recent backbone GridFormer by over 0.53 dB on the three-task benchmark and a remarkable 0.86 dB on the five-task benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations, leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks, DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11pag...</summary><p>11pages, 3figures, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods focus on detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.</p></details> |  |

We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the theory available for the Gaussian case cannot be extended to the Poisson case, due to the non-Lipschitz gradient of the fidelity function, the Kullback-Leibler functional, or the absence of closed-form solution for the proximal operator of such term, leading to employ iterative solvers for the inner subproblem. In this work we extend the idea of PIDSplit+ algorithm, exploiting the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, to PnP scheme: this allows to provide a closed form solution for the deblurring step, with no need for iterative solvers. The convergence of the method is assured by employing a firmly non expansive denoiser. The proposed method, namely PnPSplit+, is tested on different Poisson image restoration problems, showing remarkable performance even in presence of high noise level and severe blurring conditions.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing methods focus on any one particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3) a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | Under Review |

Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance, and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models. Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Adverse weather significantly degrades image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models, particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors, effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration, primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for diverse low-level computer vision problems.</p></details> |  |

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain, effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.

When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper, a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem, the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\) and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |

Image restoration has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet). Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.</p></details> |  |

To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, also Markov properties of the high-order degradation process and Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution.

Although unsupervised part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors. By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover, several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple categories.

| **[RefSTAR: Blind Facial Image Restoration with Reference Selection, Transfer, and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10470v1)** | 2025-07-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.10470v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind facial image restoration is highly challenging due to unknown complex degradations and the sensitivity of humans to faces. Although existing methods introduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality reference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems, mainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this paper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from high-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image restoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and reconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference selection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a RefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating masks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the trivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion paradigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated. Finally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further ensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle consistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive experiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance, showing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer quality.

Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, these GAN-based approaches struggle to surpass the performance of conventional unsupervised GAN-based frameworks without significantly modifying model structures or increasing the computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for existing restoration models. This strategy utilizes information from the previous stage as feedback to guide subsequent stages, achieving significant performance improvement without increasing the framework's inference complexity. The SC strategy comprises a prompt learning (PL) module and a restorer ($Res$). It iteratively replaces the previous less powerful fixed restorer $\overline{Res}$ in the PL module with a more powerful $Res$. The enhanced PL module generates better pseudo-degraded/clean image pairs, leading to a more powerful $Res$ for the next iteration. Our SC can significantly improve the $Res$'s performance by over 1.5 dB without adding extra parameters or computational complexity during inference. Meanwhile, existing self-ensemble (SE) and our SC strategies enhance the performance of pre-trained restorers from different perspectives. As SE increases computational complexity during inference, we propose a re-boosting module to the SC (Reb-SC) to improve the SC strategy further by incorporating SE into SC without increasing inference time. This approach further enhances the restorer's performance by approximately 0.3 dB. Extensive experimental results on restoration tasks demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art unsupervised restoration methods.

Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous (spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code, and dataset of this project will be released at github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.</p></details> |  |

However, their multi-step denoising process introduces significant computational overhead, limiting their practical deployment. Furthermore, existing methods struggle to effectively remove severe JPEG artifact, especially in highly compressed images. To address these challenges, we propose CODiff, a compression-aware one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifact removal. The core of CODiff is the compression-aware visual embedder (CaVE), which extracts and leverages JPEG compression priors to guide the diffusion model. We propose a dual learning strategy that combines explicit and implicit learning. Specifically, explicit learning enforces a quality prediction objective to differentiate low-quality images with different compression levels. Implicit learning employs a reconstruction objective that enhances the model's generalization. This dual learning allows for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression. Experimental results demonstrate that CODiff surpasses recent leading methods in both quantitative and visual quality metrics.

Existing HSI restoration methods typically rely on specific degradation assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MP-HSIR}, a novel multi-prompt framework that effectively integrates spectral, textual, and visual prompts to achieve universal HSI restoration across diverse degradation types and intensities. Specifically, we develop a prompt-guided spatial-spectral transformer, which incorporates spatial self-attention and a prompt-guided dual-branch spectral self-attention. Since degradations affect spectral features differently, we introduce spectral prompts in the local spectral branch to provide universal low-rank spectral patterns as prior knowledge for enhancing spectral reconstruction. Furthermore, the text-visual synergistic prompt fuses high-level semantic representations with fine-grained visual features to encode degradation information, thereby guiding the restoration process. Extensive experiments on 9 HSI restoration tasks, including all-in-one scenarios, generalization tests, and real-world cases, demonstrate that MP-HSIR not only consistently outperforms existing all-in-one methods but also surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific approaches across multiple tasks.

Our method trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined by the diffusion model. This results in a powerful, amortized sampler capable of generating diverse posterior samples with a single neural function evaluation, generalizing across various measurements. Unlike existing methods, our approach is unsupervised, requires no paired training data, and is applicable to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of tasks, including image restoration, manifold signal reconstruction, and climate data imputation. APS significantly outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality, enabling real-time, high-quality solutions to inverse problems across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

They are a critical tool in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models -- which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project website https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.</p></details> |  |

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

Requiring only a single dataset and black box access to the prediction method, it consists of three steps: computing suitable residuals, symmetrizing and scaling them with a pre-factor $\rho$, and using them to define and solve a modified prediction problem recentered at the current estimate. We refer to it as wild refitting, since it uses Rademacher residual symmetrization as in a wild bootstrap variant. Under relatively mild conditions allowing for noise heterogeneity, we establish a high probability guarantee on its performance, showing that the wild refit with a suitably chosen wild noise scale $\rho$ gives an upper bound on prediction error. This theoretical analysis provides guidance into the design of such procedures, including how the residuals should be formed, the amount of noise rescaling in the wild sub-problem needed for upper bounds, and the local stability properties of the block-box procedure. We illustrate the applicability of this procedure to various problems, including non-rigid structure-from-motion recovery with structured matrix penalties; plug-and-play image restoration with deep neural network priors; and randomized sketching with kernel methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions: fixed discussion, corrected spelling</p></details> |

Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce Kernel Density Steering (KDS), a novel inference-time framework promoting robust, high-fidelity outputs through explicit local mode-seeking. KDS employs an $N$-particle ensemble of diffusion samples, computing patch-wise kernel density estimation gradients from their collective outputs. These gradients steer patches in each particle towards shared, higher-density regions identified within the ensemble. This collective local mode-seeking mechanism, acting as "collective wisdom", steers samples away from spurious modes prone to artifacts, arising from independent sampling or model imperfections, and towards more robust, high-fidelity structures. This allows us to obtain better quality samples at the expense of higher compute by simultaneously sampling multiple particles. As a plug-and-play framework, KDS requires no retraining or external verifiers, seamlessly integrating with various diffusion samplers. Extensive numerical validations demonstrate KDS substantially improves both quantitative and qualitative performance on challenging real-world super-resolution and image inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

These techniques are often not applicable in unconditional generation or in various downstream tasks such as image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling guidance, called Perturbed-Attention Guidance (PAG), which improves diffusion sample quality across both unconditional and conditional settings, achieving this without requiring additional training or the integration of external modules. PAG is designed to progressively enhance the structure of samples throughout the denoising process. It involves generating intermediate samples with degraded structure by substituting selected self-attention maps in diffusion U-Net with an identity matrix, by considering the self-attention mechanisms' ability to capture structural information, and guiding the denoising process away from these degraded samples. In both ADM and Stable Diffusion, PAG surprisingly improves sample quality in conditional and even unconditional scenarios.

Building upon these achievements, diffusion models have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from degraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained diffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning, these methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising process. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM), a strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing from an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising steps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce inconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts the weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate potential disharmony. We validate proposed methods on ImageNet-1K and CelebA-HQ across multiple image restoration tasks, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, and compressed sensing.

In this work, we introduce Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block, $\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control, forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.

However, SSM-based approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing. Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios. Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory, thereby significantly improving computational efficiency.

Nevertheless, finding the right balancing point between the certainties and uncertainties remains an open question. Therefore, we propose Double-Diffusion, a novel diffusion probabilistic model that harnesses the power of known physics to guide air quality forecasting with stochasticity. To the best of our knowledge, while precedents have been made of using conditional diffusion models to predict air pollution, this is the first attempt to use physics as a conditional generative approach for air quality prediction. Along with a sampling strategy adopted from image restoration and a new denoiser architecture, Double-Diffusion ranks first in most evaluation scenarios across two real-life datasets compared with other probabilistic models, it also cuts inference time by 50% to 30% while enjoying an increase between 3-12% in Continuous Ranked Probabilistic Score (CRPS).</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks, improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors, further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR. Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing general IR architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our method is adaptable to any black-box generative model, including those locked behind an opaque API, requires only easily attainable data for calibration, and is highly customizable via the choice of a local image similarity metric. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for our method that span fidelity error control (according to our local image similarity metric), reconstruction quality, and robustness in the face of data leakage. Finally, we empirically evaluate these results and establish our method's solid performance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Our baseline model implements SimpleGate activation, Simplified Channel Activation (SCA), and LayerNormalization. We compare this baseline to different variants that replace or remove components. Quantitative results (PSNR, SSIM) and examples illustrate how each modification affects restoration performance. Our findings support the NAFNet design: the SimpleGate and simplified attention mechanisms yield better results than conventional activations and attention, while LayerNorm proves to be important for stable training. We conclude with recommendations for model design, discuss potential improvements, and future work.</p></details> |  |

However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer (TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training convergence, and generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle with an accurate understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities. Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe degradation.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics.

Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

In this work, we propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors, Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes, which pose significant challenges for existing methods. Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing and often introduce artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT) modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing. The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration performance.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution. We also showcase the effectiveness of our method with a proof of concept for lens calibration: a real-world application traditionally requiring time-consuming experiments and specialized equipment. In contrast, our approach achieves this with minimal data acquisition effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/inria-thoth/ddm4ip</p></details> |

A popular class of methods, based on Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), attempts to approximate the intractable posterior score function directly. In this work, we present a novel expression for the exact posterior score for purely denoising tasks that is tractable in terms of the unconditional score function. We leverage this result to analyze the time-dependent error in the DPS score for denoising tasks and compute step sizes on the fly to minimize the error at each time step. We demonstrate that these step sizes are transferable to related inverse problems such as colorization, random inpainting, and super resolution. Despite its simplicity, this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques and enables sampling with fewer time steps than DPS.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities. A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark, ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time by 20 percent.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances generalization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind SR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before the final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at intermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at intermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized feature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying dropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which we attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it introduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method for blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates application across intermediate layers of networks. Specifically, for training-testing inconsistency, we re-design the form of dropout and integrate the features before and after dropout adaptively. For inconsistency in generalization requirements across different layers, we innovatively design an adaptive training strategy to strengthen feature propagation by layer-wise annealing. Experimental results show that our method outperforms all past regularization methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, also highly effective in other image restoration tasks.

Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in hard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee clarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization ability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially promoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that incorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing the convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture, we leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning capabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information. Additionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual priors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence scores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during training. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances but also improves the accuracy of text structure.</p></details> |  |

While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

We propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE), which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems.

With the growing demand for high-quality imaging (\textit{e.g.}, 4K and 8K), achieving a balance between restoration quality and computational efficiency has become increasingly critical. Existing methods, primarily based on CNNs, Transformers, or their hybrid approaches, apply uniform deep representation extraction across the image. However, these methods often struggle to effectively model long-range dependencies and largely overlook the spatial characteristics of image degradation (regions with richer textures tend to suffer more severe damage), making it hard to achieve the best trade-off between restoration quality and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a novel texture-aware image restoration method, TAMambaIR, which simultaneously perceives image textures and achieves a trade-off between performance and efficiency.

The combination of these techniques ensures better detection performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied directly to low-resolution images.

While existing image restoration efforts have achieved notable success, they are still hindered by two critical challenges: limited generalization across dynamically varying degradation scenarios and a suboptimal balance between preserving local details and modeling global dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Mamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image restoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the model's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a CLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with CLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal feature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various degradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies and fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that integrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range modeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative optimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity, preserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we introduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances global modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention to degradation-sensitive regions.

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the $\textit{significant}$ superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

However, their inherent formulation as a regression problem makes them prone to regression to the mean, limiting their ability to capture fine details, retain high-frequency information, and handle noise effectively. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process. I-INRs effectively recover high-frequency details, improve robustness to noise, and achieve superior reconstruction quality. Our framework seamlessly integrates with existing INR architectures, delivering substantial performance gains across various tasks. Extensive experiments show that I-INRs outperform baseline methods, including WIRE, SIREN, and Gauss, in diverse computer vision applications such as image restoration, image denoising, and object occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods narrowly focus on subject identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components: Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning, enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts. To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards. Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging storyboards than existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://daviddinkevich.github.io/Story2Board/</p></details> |

Despite the improvements of this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications. Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time optimization at a fraction of the computational cost.

ICL has recently been explored for computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL). Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by 8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv, respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task better and further improve the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 % of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM) above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering, enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment.

| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v1)** | 2025-08-13 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2508.09922v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Contrary to the Shannon entropy, the general form of Tsallis entropy renders the optimal policy not necessarily a Gibbs measure. Herein, the Lagrange multiplier and KKT condition are needed to ensure that the learned policy is a probability density function. As a consequence, the characterization of the optimal policy using the q-function also involves a Lagrange multiplier. In response, we establish the martingale characterization of the q-function and devise two q-learning algorithms depending on whether the Lagrange multiplier can be derived explicitly or not. In the latter case, we consider different parameterizations of the optimal q-function and the optimal policy, and update them alternatively in an Actor-Critic manner. We also study two numerical examples, namely, an optimal liquidation problem in dark pools and a non-LQ control problem. It is interesting to see therein that the optimal policies under the Tsallis entropy regularization can be characterized explicitly, which are distributions concentrated on some compact support. The satisfactory performance of our q-learning algorithms is illustrated in each example.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2025 Camera-Ready Version</p></details> |

Focusing on the task of approximating a target data distribution in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to within $\varepsilon$ total-variation distance, we propose a principled, training-free sampling algorithm that requires only the order of $$ d^{1+2/K} \varepsilon^{-1/K} $$ score function evaluations (up to log factor) in the presence of accurate scores, where $K>0$ is an arbitrary fixed integer. This result applies to a broad class of target data distributions, without the need for assumptions such as smoothness or log-concavity. Our theory is robust vis-a-vis inexact score estimation, degrading gracefully as the score estimation error increases -- without demanding higher-order smoothness on the score estimates as assumed in previous work. The proposed algorithm draws insight from high-order ODE solvers, leveraging high-order Lagrange interpolation and successive refinement to approximate the integral derived from the probability flow ODE. More broadly, our work develops a theoretical framework towards understanding the efficacy of high-order methods for accelerated sampling.</p></details> |  |

Recently, latent diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely, generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements. To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.</p></details> |  |

While super-resolution is an efficient post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details. Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific simulations.

In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features, effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level color alignment.

While recent approaches have sought to leverage generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations. To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs. The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability, leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from 2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV Workshops</p></details> |

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective, dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop 3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through semantic-aware spatial configuration. Our framework, CoherenDream, achieves consistent improvement across multiple metrics on TIFA subset.As the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We first simulate IMU recordings using an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. Our transformer-based diffusion models synthesize loose IMU data and estimate human poses from this challenging loose IMU data. We also demonstrate that incorporating garment-related parameters during training on loose IMU data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.

The work approaches this problem from the membership inference attack (MIA) perspective. We first identify the limitation of applying existing MIA methods for proprietary diffusion models: the required access of internal U-nets. To address the above problem, we introduce a novel membership inference attack method that uses only the image-to-image variation API and operates without access to the model's internal U-net. Our method is based on the intuition that the model can more easily obtain an unbiased noise prediction estimate for images from the training set. By applying the API multiple times to the target image, averaging the outputs, and comparing the result to the original image, our approach can classify whether a sample was part of the training set. We validate our method using DDIM and Stable Diffusion setups and further extend both our approach and existing algorithms to the Diffusion Transformer architecture.

However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores, state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images, especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work, we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |

However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges (DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN) information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way, and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent heterogeneity in single-cell responses.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF) system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models. The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically coherent, and structurally consistent image generations.

Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.</p></details> |  |

It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose \emph{underdamped diffusion bridges}, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and no hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images. Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and CommunityForensics.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency. Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1 Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages, particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally, our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.</p></details> |  |

Existing denoising methods, however, either rely on local approximations that require a linear scan of the entire dataset or treat denoising as generic function approximation problems, often sacrificing efficiency and interpretability. We consider the problem of efficiently denoising a new noisy data point sampled from an unknown $d$-dimensional manifold $M \in \mathbb{R}^D$, using only noisy samples. This work proposes a framework for test-time efficient manifold denoising, by framing the concept of "learning-to-denoise" as "learning-to-optimize". We have two technical innovations: (i) online learning methods which learn to optimize over the manifold of clean signals using only noisy data, effectively "growing" an optimizer one sample at a time. (ii) mixed-order methods which guarantee that the learned optimizers achieve global optimality, ensuring both efficiency and near-optimal denoising performance. We corroborate these claims with theoretical analyses of both the complexity and denoising performance of mixed-order traversal. Our experiments on scientific manifolds demonstrate significantly improved complexity-performance tradeoffs compared to nearest neighbor search, which underpins existing provable denoising approaches based on exhaustive search.</p></details> |  |

However, the costly annotation process and privacy concerns limit the construction of large-scale medical datasets, hampering the further application of AI in healthcare. To address the data scarcity in lung cancer screening, we propose Lung-DDPM, a thoracic CT image synthesis approach that effectively generates high-fidelity 3D synthetic CT images, which prove helpful in downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Our method is based on semantic layout-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), enabling anatomically reasonable, seamless, and consistent sample generation even from incomplete semantic layouts. Our results suggest that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in image quality evaluation and downstream lung nodule segmentation tasks. Specifically, Lung-DDPM achieved superior performance on our large validation cohort, with a Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) of 0.0047, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) of 0.0070, and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0024. These results were 7.4$\times$, 3.1$\times$, and 29.5$\times$ better than the second-best competitors, respectively. Furthermore, the lung nodule segmentation model, trained on a dataset combining real and Lung-DDPM-generated synthetic samples, attained a Dice Coefficient (Dice) of 0.3914 and sensitivity of 0.4393. This represents 8.8% and 18.6% improvements in Dice and sensitivity compared to the model trained solely on real samples. The experimental results highlight Lung-DDPM's potential for a broader range of medical imaging applications, such as general tumor segmentation, cancer survival estimation, and risk prediction.

Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted as part of the A&A Special Issue `Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)', 34 pages, 26 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods mainly adopt 2D multiview diffusion models to generate intermediate multiview images, and use the Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) to create the final meshes. However, the multiview images exhibit local inconsistencies, and the meshes often lack fidelity to the input image or look blurry. We propose Fancy123, featuring two enhancement modules and an unprojection operation to address the above three issues, respectively. The appearance enhancement module deforms the 2D multiview images to realign misaligned pixels for better multiview consistency. The fidelity enhancement module deforms the 3D mesh to match the input image. The unprojection of the input image and deformed multiview images onto LRM's generated mesh ensures high clarity, discarding LRM's predicted blurry-looking mesh colors. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify Fancy123's SoTA performance with significant improvement. Also, the two enhancement modules are plug-and-play and work at inference time, allowing seamless integration into various existing single-image-to-3D methods.

We present TaoCache, a training-free, plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast (PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks. Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the same speedups.</p></details> |  |

Compared to text or image modalities, leveraging 3D colored point clouds as input (colored-PC-to-mesh) offers inherent advantages in comprehensively and precisely replicating the target object's 360{\deg} characteristics. While most existing colored-PC-to-mesh methods suffer from blurry textures or require hard-to-acquire 3D training data, we propose PointDreamer, a novel framework that harnesses 2D diffusion prior for superior texture quality. Crucially, unlike prior 2D-diffusion-for-3D works driven by text or image inputs, PointDreamer successfully adapts 2D diffusion models to 3D point cloud data by a novel project-inpaint-unproject pipeline. Specifically, it first projects the point cloud into sparse 2D images and then performs diffusion-based inpainting. After that, diverging from most existing 3D reconstruction or generation approaches that predict texture in 3D/UV space thus often yielding blurry texture, PointDreamer achieves high-quality texture by directly unprojecting the inpainted 2D images to the 3D mesh. Furthermore, we identify for the first time a typical kind of unprojection artifact appearing in occlusion borders, which is common in other multiview-image-to-3D pipelines but less-explored. To address this, we propose a novel solution named the Non-Border-First (NBF) unprojection strategy. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate that PointDreamer, though zero-shot, exhibits SoTA performance (30% improvement on LPIPS score from 0.118 to 0.068), and is robust to noisy, sparse, or even incomplete input data.

Recent methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1) token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA (TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.</p></details> | 13pages,2figures |

Current T2I models allow users to specify object colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more controlled and refined colorization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both multi-step and one-step generation.</p></details> |  |

Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences, lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy to enhance generation efficiency.

However, their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic networking and co-inference across distributed environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025.

The generation of a single frame requires the model to process the entire sequence, including the future. We address this limitation by adapting a pretrained bidirectional diffusion transformer to an autoregressive transformer that generates frames on-the-fly. To further reduce latency, we extend distribution matching distillation (DMD) to videos, distilling 50-step diffusion model into a 4-step generator. To enable stable and high-quality distillation, we introduce a student initialization scheme based on teacher's ODE trajectories, as well as an asymmetric distillation strategy that supervises a causal student model with a bidirectional teacher. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation in autoregressive generation, allowing long-duration video synthesis despite training on short clips. Our model achieves a total score of 84.27 on the VBench-Long benchmark, surpassing all previous video generation models. It enables fast streaming generation of high-quality videos at 9.4 FPS on a single GPU thanks to KV caching.

Generating 1K Video within 16 Seconds using Extremely Compressed Motion Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13552v3)** | 2025-08-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.13552v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this paper, we argue that videos contain significantly more redundant information than images, allowing them to be encoded with very few motion latents. Towards this goal, we design an image-conditioned VAE that projects videos into extremely compressed latent space and decode them based on content images. This magic Reducio charm enables 64x reduction of latents compared to a common 2D VAE, without sacrificing the quality. Building upon Reducio-VAE, we can train diffusion models for high-resolution video generation efficiently. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage generation paradigm, first generating a condition image via text-to-image generation, followed by text-image-to-video generation with the proposed Reducio-DiT. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves strong performance in evaluation. More importantly, our method significantly boosts the training and inference efficiency of video LDMs. Reducio-DiT is trained in just 3.2K A100 GPU hours in total and can generate a 16-frame 1024$\times$1024 video clip within 15.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

The gap mainly stems from the discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2) synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in modeling the real-world degradations.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Coefficient (MAC), a plug-in module for flow and diffusion models that extends conventional unidimensional coefficients to multidimensional ones and enables inference trajectory-wise adaptation. MAC is trained via simulation-based feedback through adversarial refinement. Empirical results across diverse frameworks and datasets demonstrate that MAC enhances generative quality with high training efficiency. Consequently, our work offers a new perspective on inference trajectory optimality, encouraging future research to move beyond vector field design and to leverage training-efficient, simulation-based optimization.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Paper |

We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

For example, in a citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction. Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features (e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space, whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review.

Despite recent advances in diffusion models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story, annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation. Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention (MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text, respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization, we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations.

We propose a method that estimates from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines. Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages.

This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio, StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this, StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |

Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods still face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism across various scenes and styles.</p></details> |  |

This inverse problem is highly nonlinear and ill-posed, posing significant challenges for conventional optimization-based methods, which, despite being grounded in physical models, often fail to recover fine structural details. Recent deep learning strategies, including end-to-end and post-processing networks, have improved reconstruction quality but typically require large paired training datasets and may struggle to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we propose a physics-informed hybrid framework that integrates diffusion models as learned regularization within a data-consistency-driven variational scheme. Specifically, we introduce Single-Step Diffusion Regularization (SSD-Reg), a novel approach that embeds diffusion priors into the iterative reconstruction process, enabling the recovery of complex anatomical structures without the need for paired data. SSD-Reg maintains fidelity to both the governing physics and learned structural distributions, improving accuracy, stability, and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSD-Reg, implemented as a Plug-and-Play (PnP) module, provides a flexible and effective solution for tackling the ill-posedness inherent in functional image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by deeply integrating a pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm. Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple, diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model. This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently, TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we benchmark three operator-learning surrogates for the Single Particle Model (SPM): Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and a newly proposed parameter-embedded Fourier Neural Operator (PE-FNO), which conditions each spectral layer on particle radius and solid-phase diffusivity. Models are trained on simulated trajectories spanning four current families (constant, triangular, pulse-train, and Gaussian-random-field) and a full range of State-of-Charge (SOC) (0 % to 100 %). DeepONet accurately replicates constant-current behaviour but struggles with more dynamic loads. The basic FNO maintains mesh invariance and keeps concentration errors below 1 %, with voltage mean-absolute errors under 1.7 mV across all load types. Introducing parameter embedding marginally increases error, but enables generalisation to varying radii and diffusivities. PE-FNO executes approximately 200 times faster than a 16-thread SPM solver. Consequently, PE-FNO's capabilities in inverse tasks are explored in a parameter estimation task with Bayesian optimisation, recovering anode and cathode diffusivities with 1.14 % and 8.4 % mean absolute percentage error, respectively, and 0.5918 percentage points higher error in comparison with classical methods. These results pave the way for neural operators to meet the accuracy, speed and parametric flexibility demands of real-time battery management, design-of-experiments and large-scale inference. PE-FNO outperforms conventional neural surrogates, offering a practical path towards high-speed and high-fidelity electrochemical digital twins.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Recent works utilize video model to achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation.

However, training these models requires large-scale datasets, which brings challenges related to efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of web data. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a new data synthesis and curation method for generating image-caption pairs. Unlike traditional methods, where captions are generated from images, SynthVLM utilizes advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to synthesize and select images from text captions, thereby creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. We further introduce SynthVLM-100K, a high-quality dataset consisting of 100K curated and synthesized image-caption pairs. In both model and human evaluations, SynthVLM-100K outperforms traditional real-world datasets. Leveraging this dataset, we develop a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B, which achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on various vision question-answering (VQA) tasks. Notably, our models outperform LLaVA across most metrics with only 18\% pretrain data. Furthermore, SynthVLM-7B and SynthVLM-13B attain SOTA performance on the MMLU benchmark, demonstrating that the high-quality SynthVLM-100K dataset preserves language abilities.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

However, this study confirms the existence of overfitting in diffusion model training, particularly in data-limited regimes. To address this challenge, we propose Score Augmentation (ScoreAug), a novel data augmentation framework specifically designed for diffusion models. Unlike conventional augmentation approaches that operate on clean data, ScoreAug applies transformations to noisy data, aligning with the inherent denoising mechanism of diffusion. Crucially, ScoreAug further requires the denoiser to predict the augmentation of the original target. This design establishes an equivariant learning objective, enabling the denoiser to learn scores across varied denoising spaces, thereby realizing what we term score augmentation. We also theoretically analyze the relationship between scores in different spaces under general transformations. In experiments, we extensively validate ScoreAug on multiple benchmarks including CIFAR-10, FFHQ, AFHQv2, and ImageNet, with results demonstrating significant performance improvements over baselines. Notably, ScoreAug effectively mitigates overfitting across diverse scenarios, such as varying data scales and model capacities, while exhibiting stable convergence properties. Another advantage of ScoreAug over standard data augmentation lies in its ability to circumvent data leakage issues under certain conditions. Furthermore, we show that ScoreAug can be synergistically combined with traditional data augmentation techniques to achieve additional performance gains.</p></details> |  |

Most existing video matting datasets provide only human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a 3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance, and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes, illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method.

While previous studies have primarily focused on generating gene expression or haplotype data, this study explores generating genotype data in both unconditioned and phenotype-conditioned settings, which is inherently more challenging due to the discrete nature of genotype data. In this work, we developed and evaluated commonly used generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and proposed adaptation tailored to discrete genotype data. We conducted extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, including all chromosomes from cow and multiple chromosomes from human. Model performance was assessed using a well-established set of metrics drawn from both deep learning and quantitative genetics literature. Our results show that these models can effectively capture genetic patterns and preserve genotype-phenotype association.

In this paper, we present a novel framework for learning Dynamic Affordance across various target object categories. To address the scarcity of 4D HOI datasets, our method learns the 3D dynamic affordance from synthetically generated 4D HOI samples. Specifically, we propose a pipeline that first generates 2D HOI videos from a given 3D target object using a pre-trained video diffusion model, then lifts them into 3D to generate 4D HOI samples. Leveraging these synthesized 4D HOI samples, we train DAViD, our generative 4D human-object interaction model, which is composed of two key components: (1) a human motion diffusion model (MDM) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to fine-tune a pre-trained MDM to learn the HOI motion concepts from limited HOI motion samples, (2) a motion diffusion model for 4D object poses conditioned by produced human interaction motions. Interestingly, DAViD can integrate newly learned HOI motion concepts with pre-trained human motions to create novel HOI motions, even for multiple HOI motion concepts, demonstrating the advantage of our pipeline with LoRA in integrating dynamic HOI concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DAViD outperforms baselines in synthesizing HOI motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://snuvclab.github.io/david/</p></details> |

We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient collection of a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach synthesizes diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to 3D scene arrangement tasks and human motion synthesis using our OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |

Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands, preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |

This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural 4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture: it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wanderer7-sk.github.io/Dream4D.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Sea-Undistort, a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 1200 paired 512x512 through-water scenes rendered in Blender. Each pair comprises a distortion-free and a distorted view, featuring realistic water effects such as sun glint, waves, and scattering over diverse seabeds. Accompanied by per-image metadata such as camera parameters, sun position, and average depth, Sea-Undistort enables supervised training that is otherwise infeasible in real environments. We use Sea-Undistort to benchmark two state-of-the-art image restoration methods alongside an enhanced lightweight diffusion-based framework with an early-fusion sun-glint mask. When applied to real aerial data, the enhanced diffusion model delivers more complete Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the seabed, especially in deeper areas, reduces bathymetric errors, suppresses glint and scattering, and crisply restores fine seabed details.

Consequently, reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules: the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets, achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods. Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.</p></details> |  |

However, their sequential nature leads to long inference times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference, leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without requiring any additional training.

Originating as a groundbreaking technique for early gastric cancer treatment, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection has evolved into a versatile intervention for diverse gastrointestinal lesions. While computer-assisted systems significantly enhance procedural precision and safety in ESD, their clinical adoption faces a critical bottleneck: reliable surgical phase recognition within complex endoscopic workflows. Current state-of-the-art approaches predominantly rely on multi-stage refinement architectures that iteratively optimize temporal predictions. In this paper, we present Clinical Prior Knowledge-Constrained Diffusion (CPKD), a novel generative framework that reimagines phase recognition through denoising diffusion principles while preserving the core iterative refinement philosophy. This architecture progressively reconstructs phase sequences starting from random noise and conditioned on visual-temporal features. To better capture three domain-specific characteristics, including positional priors, boundary ambiguity, and relation dependency, we design a conditional masking strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate clinical prior knowledge into the model training to improve its ability to correct phase logical errors. Comprehensive evaluations on ESD820, Cholec80, and external multi-center demonstrate that our proposed CPKD achieves superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of diffusion-based generative paradigms for surgical phase recognition.</p></details> |  |

Users increasingly seek to apply various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry. However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run. Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional multi-step diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features, offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$ faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding multi-step diffusion-based variant.</p></details> |  |

Existing image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion, which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly. Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (oral).

In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models.

While cloud-based retraining can address this issue, many IoT deployments operate with limited connectivity and energy constraints, making traditional fine-tuning approaches impractical. We explore this challenge through the lens of wildlife ecology, where camera traps must maintain accurate species classification across changing seasons, weather, and habitats without reliable connectivity. We introduce WildFit, an autonomous in-situ adaptation framework that leverages the key insight that background scenes change more frequently than the visual characteristics of monitored species. WildFit combines background-aware synthesis to generate training samples on-device with drift-aware fine-tuning that triggers model updates only when necessary to conserve resources. Our background-aware synthesis surpasses efficient baselines by 7.3\% and diffusion models by 3.0\% while being orders of magnitude faster, our drift-aware fine-tuning achieves Pareto optimality with 50\% fewer updates and 1.5\% higher accuracy, and the end-to-end system outperforms domain adaptation approaches by 20--35%\% while consuming only 11.2 Wh over 37 days -- enabling battery-powered deployment.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks, revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models.

Current state-of-the-art methods primarily extend large-scale pre-trained Image-to-Video Diffusion Models (I2V-DMs) by incorporating the end-frame condition via direct fine-tuning or temporally bidirectional sampling. However, the former results in a weak end-frame constraint, while the latter inevitably disrupts the input representation of video frames, leading to suboptimal performance. To improve the end-frame constraint while avoiding disruption of the input representation, we propose a novel video inbetweening framework specific to recent and more powerful transformer-based I2V-DMs, termed EF-VI. It efficiently strengthens the end-frame constraint by utilizing an enhanced injection. This is based on our proposed well-designed lightweight module, termed EF-Net, which encodes only the end frame and expands it into temporally adaptive frame-wise features injected into the I2V-DM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our EF-VI compared with other baselines.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Although existing deep learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to Realistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by integrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key challenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts, providing insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which limits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches and textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model to selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining structural coherence. To tackle this task, we propose HiGarment, a novel framework that comprises two core components: i) a multi-modal semantic enhancement mechanism that enhances fabric representation across textual and visual modalities, and ii) a harmonized cross-attention mechanism that dynamically balances information from flat sketches and text prompts, allowing controllable synthesis by generating either sketch-aligned (image-biased) or text-guided (text-biased) outputs. Furthermore, we collect Multi-modal Detailed Garment, the largest open-source dataset for garment generation.

However, it is observed that even when DMs are properly unlearned before release, malicious finetuning can compromise this process, causing DMs to relearn the unlearned concepts. This occurs partly because certain benign concepts (e.g., "skin") retained in DMs are related to the unlearned ones (e.g., "nudity"), facilitating their relearning via finetuning. To address this, we propose meta-unlearning on DMs. Intuitively, a meta-unlearned DM should behave like an unlearned DM when used as is; moreover, if the meta-unlearned DM undergoes malicious finetuning on unlearned concepts, the related benign concepts retained within it will be triggered to self-destruct, hindering the relearning of unlearned concepts. Our meta-unlearning framework is compatible with most existing unlearning methods, requiring only the addition of an easy-to-implement meta objective. We validate our approach through empirical experiments on meta-unlearning concepts from Stable Diffusion models (SD-v1-4 and SDXL), supported by extensive ablation studies.

Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative. In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time. In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining appearance consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V) generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation. Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/miramo_project</p></details> |

However, our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental confounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause heuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These misleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations induced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability under distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing negative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process, CNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus reduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal regularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental confounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives that promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive experiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate that CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and robustness in OOD recommendation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, Under-review</p></details> |

Despite their effectiveness, concerns have been raised that diffusion models - widely adopted in other machine-learning domains - could potentially lead to unfair outcomes, since they are trained to recover data distributions that often encode inherent biases. Motivated by the related literature, and acknowledging the extensive discussion around bias and fairness aspects in recommendation, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study of fairness for DiffRec, chronologically the pioneer technique in diffusion-based recommendation. Our empirical study involves DiffRec and its variant L-DiffRec, tested against nine recommender systems on two benchmarking datasets to assess recommendation utility and fairness from both consumer and provider perspectives. Specifically, we first evaluate the utility and fairness dimensions separately and, then, within a multi-criteria setting to investigate whether, and to what extent, these approaches can achieve a trade-off between the two. While showing worrying trends in alignment with the more general machine-learning literature on diffusion models, our results also indicate promising directions to address the unfairness issue in future work.

Existing deep learning approaches often struggle to balance global structural consistency with local detail preservation, especially under complex meteorological conditions. We propose DuoCast, a dual-diffusion framework that decomposes precipitation forecasting into low- and high-frequency components modeled in orthogonal latent subspaces. We theoretically prove that this frequency decomposition reduces prediction error compared to conventional single branch U-Net diffusion models. In DuoCast, the low-frequency model captures large-scale trends via convolutional encoders conditioned on weather front dynamics, while the high-frequency model refines fine-scale variability using a self-attention-based architecture. Experiments on four benchmark radar datasets show that DuoCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both spatial detail and temporal evolution.</p></details> |  |

While generative adversarial networks and diffusion models can produce more natural-looking patches, they often fail to balance stealthiness with attack effectiveness and lack flexibility for user customization. To address these limitations, we propose BadPatch, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating customizable and naturalistic adversarial patches. Our approach allows users to start from a reference image (rather than random noise) and incorporates masks to create patches of various shapes, not limited to squares. To preserve the original semantics during the diffusion process, we employ Null-text inversion to map random noise samples to a single input image and generate patches through Incomplete Diffusion Optimization (IDO). Our method achieves attack performance comparable to state-of-the-art non-naturalistic patches while maintaining a natural appearance. Using BadPatch, we construct AdvT-shirt-1K, the first physical adversarial T-shirt dataset comprising over a thousand images captured in diverse scenarios. AdvT-shirt-1K can serve as a useful dataset for training or testing future defense methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/Wwangb/BadPatch</p></details> |

The animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP); Oral</p></details> |

Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions. Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling. Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However, questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities: Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets for AI diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Workshop on Human-AI Collaboration at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression (PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning. Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

However, modeling this progression remains challenging due to 1) the scarcity of longitudinal data obtained through irregular and infrequent subject visits and 2) the complex interplay of pathological mechanisms across brain regions and disease stages, where traditional models assume fixed mechanisms throughout disease progression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel stage-aware Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that explicitly models how different contributing mechanisms dominate at different disease stages through time-dependent expert weighting.Data-wise, we utilize an iterative dual optimization method to properly estimate the temporal position of individual observations, constructing a co hort-level progression trajectory from irregular snapshots. Model-wise, we enhance the spatial component with an inhomogeneous graph neural diffusion model (IGND) that allows diffusivity to vary based on node states and time, providing more flexible representations of brain networks. We also introduce a localized neural reaction module to capture complex dynamics beyond standard processes.The resulting IGND-MoE model dynamically integrates these components across temporal states, offering a principled way to understand how stage-specific pathological mechanisms contribute to progression. The stage-wise weights yield novel clinical insights that align with literature, suggesting that graph-related processes are more influential at early stages, while other unknown physical processes become dominant later on.</p></details> |  |

To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple atomic spatial capabilities to handle complex and dynamic tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs. The evaluation code and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/SpaCE-10.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging a task vector-based model merging technique, we integrate a state-of-the-art coding LLM into a strong vision-language backbone, while preserving both visual comprehension and advanced coding skills. To support training and evaluation, we introduce the Multimodal Coding Dataset (MCD), a large-scale and diverse collection of 598k samples, including high-quality HTML code, chart image-code pairs, image-augmented StackOverflow QA, and algorithmic problems. Furthermore, we propose InfiBench-V, a novel and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess models on visually-rich, real-world programming questions that demand a nuanced understanding of both textual and visual contexts. Extensive experiments show that VisCodex achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs and approaches proprietary models like GPT-4o, highlighting the effectiveness of our model merging strategy and new datasets.</p></details> |  |

In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. We then propose Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) to unlock the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document interpretation. In a comprehensive evaluation across 42 public benchmarks, GLM-4.5V achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks among open-source models of similar size, and demonstrates competitive or even superior results compared to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on challenging tasks including Coding and GUI Agents. Meanwhile, the smaller GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking remains highly competitive-achieving superior results to the much larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B on 29 benchmarks.

This enables us to more efficiently compare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and fine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may occur during fine-tuning. We also demonstrate the use of shift vectors to capture these concepts changes. These shift vectors allow us to recover fine-tuned concepts by applying simple, computationally inexpensive additive concept shifts in the original model. Finally, our findings also have direct applications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well as enforcing safety in MLLM output.

These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple, recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to build more intent-aware video recommenders.</p></details> |  |

Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark. M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively.

Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection. However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular, graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid diagnostics.

We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays, preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent, task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without sacrificing performance.

| **[PhotIQA: A photoacoustic image data set with image quality ratings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03478v1)** | 2025-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2507.03478v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in the evaluation stage of novel algorithms operating on images, including traditional and machine learning based methods. Due to the lack of available quality-rated medical images, most commonly used IQA methods employing reference images (i.e. full-reference IQA) have been developed and tested for natural images. Reported application inconsistencies arising when employing such measures for medical images are not surprising, as they rely on different properties than natural images. In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), especially, standard benchmarking approaches for assessing the quality of image reconstructions are lacking. PAI is a multi-physics imaging modality, in which two inverse problems have to be solved, which makes the application of IQA measures uniquely challenging due to both, acoustic and optical, artifacts. To support the development and testing of full- and no-reference IQA measures we assembled PhotIQA, a data set consisting of 1134 reconstructed photoacoustic (PA) images that were rated by 2 experts across five quality properties (overall quality, edge visibility, homogeneity, inclusion and background intensity), where the detailed rating enables usage beyond PAI. To allow full-reference assessment, highly characterised imaging test objects were used, providing a ground truth. Our baseline experiments show that HaarPSI$_{med}$ significantly outperforms SSIM in correlating with the quality ratings (SRCC: 0.83 vs. 0.62). The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13325196.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Digital twins enable full-reference quality assessment of photoacoustic image reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24514v1)** | 2025-05-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.24514v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super-temporal-resolution Photoacoustic Imaging with Dynamic Reconstruction through Implicit Neural Representation in Sparse-view](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03175v1)** | 2025-05-29 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03175v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging technique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing high-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than traditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and geometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the imaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data, produce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not consider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution is crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by the low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser technology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by characterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to improve dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and enhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input. Specifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as implicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the network are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the need for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong implicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit regularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms traditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions, effectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v4)** | 2025-03-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19097v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, as well as in the development stage of machine learning algorithms that operate on medical images. The popular full reference (FR) IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been reported in the literature, highlighting the gap between development and actual clinical application. Such inconsistencies are not surprising, as medical images have very different properties than natural images, and PSNR and SSIM have neither been targeted nor properly tested for medical images. This may cause unforeseen problems in clinical applications due to wrong judgment of novel methods. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive overview of examples where PSNR and SSIM prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase reliability and explainability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. Lastly, we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subspace accelerated measure transport methods for fast and scalable sequential experimental design, with application to photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20086v1)** | 2025-02-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.20086v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems involving expensive models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. The focus of this work is on designs that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, which is a computationally challenging task in the non-Gaussian setting. This challenge is amplified in sOED, as the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) must be approximated multiple times in distinct stages, with both prior and posterior distributions often being intractable. To address this, we derive a derivative-based upper bound for the iEIG, which not only guides design placement but also enables the construction of projectors onto likelihood-informed subspaces, facilitating parameter dimension reduction. By combining this approach with conditional measure transport maps for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for sOED, together with amortized inference, scalable to high- and infinite-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments for two inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate the effectiveness of designs that maximize our proposed upper bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidance-base Diffusion Models for Improving Photoacoustic Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06354v1)** | 2025-02-10 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.06354v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Free-hand 3D Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Reconstruction using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03505v1)** | 2025-02-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2502.03505v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces a motion-based learning network with a global-local self-attention module (MoGLo-Net) to enhance 3D reconstruction in handheld photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) imaging. Standard PAUS imaging is often limited by a narrow field of view and the inability to effectively visualize complex 3D structures. The 3D freehand technique, which aligns sequential 2D images for 3D reconstruction, faces significant challenges in accurate motion estimation without relying on external positional sensors. MoGLo-Net addresses these limitations through an innovative adaptation of the self-attention mechanism, which effectively exploits the critical regions, such as fully-developed speckle area or high-echogenic tissue area within successive ultrasound images to accurately estimate motion parameters. This facilitates the extraction of intricate features from individual frames. Additionally, we designed a patch-wise correlation operation to generate a correlation volume that is highly correlated with the scanning motion. A custom loss function was also developed to ensure robust learning with minimized bias, leveraging the characteristics of the motion parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that MoGLo-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative performance metrics. Furthermore, we expanded the application of 3D reconstruction technology beyond simple B-mode ultrasound volumes to incorporate Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, enabling 3D visualization of vasculature.

| **[Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00705v5)** | 2025-01-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.00705v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact: Self-incentive artifact removal for photoacoustic imaging without any data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14873v2)** | 2024-12-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.14873v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) uniquely combines optical contrast with the penetration depth of ultrasound, making it critical for clinical applications. However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v4)** | 2024-12-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.19224v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[4D SlingBAG: spatial-temporal coupled Gaussian ball for large-scale dynamic 3D photoacoustic iterative reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03898v1)** | 2024-12-05 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.03898v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale dynamic three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is significantly important in clinical applications. In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption. The project for 4D SlingBAG can be found in the following GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}{https://github.com/JaegerCQ/4D-SlingBAG}.</p></details> |  |

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao Bound Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557v1)** | 2024-10-12 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.09557v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.03663v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.02653v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2312.08834v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy.

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images.

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks.

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |

However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |

While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
