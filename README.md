| **[Budget-constrained Collaborative Renewable Energy Forecasting Market](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12367v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12367v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate power forecasting from renewable energy sources (RES) is crucial for integrating additional RES capacity into the power system and realizing sustainability goals. This work emphasizes the importance of integrating decentralized spatio-temporal data into forecasting models. However, decentralized data ownership presents a critical obstacle to the success of such spatio-temporal models, and incentive mechanisms to foster data-sharing need to be considered. The main contributions are a) a comparative analysis of the forecasting models, advocating for efficient and interpretable spline LASSO regression models, and b) a bidding mechanism within the data/analytics market to ensure fair compensation for data providers and enable both buyers and sellers to express their data price requirements. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism for time series forecasting is proposed, effectively incorporating price constraints and preventing redundant feature allocation. Results show significant accuracy improvements and potential monetary gains for data sellers. For wind power data, an average root mean squared error improvement of over 10% was achieved by comparing forecasts generated by the proposal with locally generated ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Market Strength Prediction with CNNs on Candlestick Chart Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12239v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12239v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates predicting market strength solely from candlestick chart images to assist investment decisions. The core research problem is developing an effective computer vision-based model using raw candlestick visuals without time-series data. We specifically analyze the impact of incorporating candlestick patterns that were detected by YOLOv8. The study implements two approaches: pure CNN on chart images and a Decomposer architecture detecting patterns. Experiments utilize diverse financial datasets spanning stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex assets. Key findings demonstrate candlestick patterns do not improve model performance over only image data in our research. The significance is illuminating limitations in candlestick image signals. Performance peaked at approximately 0.7 accuracy, below more complex time-series models. Outcomes reveal challenges in distilling sufficient predictive power from visual shapes alone, motivating the incorporation of other data modalities. This research clarifies how purely image-based models can inform trading while confirming patterns add little value over raw charts. Our content is endeavored to be delineated into distinct sections, each autonomously furnishing a unique contribution while maintaining cohesive linkage. Note that, the examples discussed herein are not limited to the scope, applicability, or knowledge outlined in the paper.</p></details> | ACMLC 2025; 8 pages |
| **[Automatic selection of the best neural architecture for time series forecasting via multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12215v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12215v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications, including weather prediction, healthcare, structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy systems, and financial markets. While models such as LSTM, GRU, Transformers, and State-Space Models (SSMs) have become standard tools in this domain, selecting the optimal architecture remains a challenge. Performance comparisons often depend on evaluation metrics and the datasets under analysis, making the choice of a universally optimal model controversial. In this work, we introduce a flexible automated framework for time series forecasting that systematically designs and evaluates diverse network architectures by integrating LSTM, GRU, multi-head Attention, and SSM blocks. Using a multi-objective optimization approach, our framework determines the number, sequence, and combination of blocks to align with specific requirements and evaluation objectives. From the resulting Pareto-optimal architectures, the best model for a given context is selected via a user-defined preference function. We validate our framework across four distinct real-world applications. Results show that a single-layer GRU or LSTM is usually optimal when minimizing training time alone. However, when maximizing accuracy or balancing multiple objectives, the best architectures are often composite designs incorporating multiple block types in specific configurations. By employing a weighted preference function, users can resolve trade-offs between objectives, revealing novel, context-specific optimal architectures. Our findings underscore that no single neural architecture is universally optimal for time series forecasting. Instead, the best-performing model emerges as a data-driven composite architecture tailored to user-defined criteria and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v6)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.11773v6) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to analyze the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR), which essentially forecasts the left-tail quantiles of returns. Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning Systems for Time-Series Power Consumption Prediction with Multi-Head Embedding Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12136v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12136v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction is increasingly popular in a variety of applications, such as smart factories and smart transportation. Researchers have used various techniques to predict power consumption, but existing models lack discussion of collaborative learning and privacy issues among multiple clients. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Head Heterogeneous Federated Learning (MHHFL) systems that consist of multiple head networks, which independently act as carriers for federated learning. In the federated period, each head network is embedded into 2-dimensional vectors and shared with the centralized source pool. MHHFL then selects appropriate source networks and blends the head networks as knowledge transfer in federated learning. The experimental results show that the proposed MHHFL systems significantly outperform the benchmark and state-of-the-art systems and reduce the prediction error by 24.9% to 94.1%. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms in the MHHFL (head network embedding and selection mechanisms), which significantly outperforms traditional federated average and random transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Federated Learning System for Sparse Healthcare Time-Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12125v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12125v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) system for sparse time series prediction in healthcare, which is a decentralized federated learning algorithm with heterogeneous transfers. We design dense and sparse feature tensors to deal with the sparsity of data sources. Heterogeneous federated learning is developed to share asynchronous parts of networks and select appropriate models for knowledge transfer. Experimental results show that the proposed HFL achieves the lowest prediction error among all benchmark systems on eight out of ten prediction tasks, with MSE reduction of 94.8%, 48.3%, and 52.1% compared to the benchmark systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of HFL in transferring knowledge from heterogeneous domains, especially in the smaller target domain. Ablation studies then demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed mechanisms for heterogeneous domain selection and switching in predicting healthcare time series with privacy, model security, and heterogeneous knowledge transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Treatment-aware Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Longitudinal MRI Generation and Diffuse Glioma Growth Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05406v4)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2309.05406v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffuse gliomas are malignant brain tumors that grow widespread through the brain. The complex interactions between neoplastic cells and normal tissue, as well as the treatment-induced changes often encountered, make glioma tumor growth modeling challenging. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network capable of future predictions of tumor masks and multi-parametric magnetic resonance images (MRI) of how the tumor will look at any future time points for different treatment plans. Our approach is based on cutting-edge diffusion probabilistic models and deep-segmentation neural networks. We included sequential multi-parametric MRI and treatment information as conditioning inputs to guide the generative diffusion process as well as a joint segmentation process. This allows for tumor growth estimates and realistic MRI generation at any given treatment and time point. We trained the model using real-world postoperative longitudinal MRI data with glioma tumor growth trajectories represented as tumor segmentation maps over time. The model demonstrates promising performance across various tasks, including generating high-quality multi-parametric MRI with tumor masks, performing time-series tumor segmentations, and providing uncertainty estimates. Combined with the treatment-aware generated MRI, the tumor growth predictions with uncertainty estimates can provide useful information for clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprints in the IEEE-TMI</p></details> |
| **[Noise-Resilient Point-wise Anomaly Detection in Time Series Using Weak Segment Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11959v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11959v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in temporal data has gained significant attention across various real-world applications, aiming to identify unusual events and mitigate potential hazards. In practice, situations often involve a mix of segment-level labels (detected abnormal events with segments of time points) and unlabeled data (undetected events), while the ideal algorithmic outcome should be point-level predictions. Therefore, the huge label information gap between training data and targets makes the task challenging. In this study, we formulate the above imperfect information as noisy labels and propose NRdetector, a noise-resilient framework that incorporates confidence-based sample selection, robust segment-level learning, and data-centric point-level detection for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Particularly, to bridge the information gap between noisy segment-level labels and missing point-level labels, we develop a novel loss function that can effectively mitigate the label noise and consider the temporal features. It encourages the smoothness of consecutive points and the separability of points from segments with different labels. Extensive experiments on real-world multivariate time series datasets with 11 different evaluation metrics demonstrate that NRdetector consistently achieves robust results across multiple real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines adapted to operate in our setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'25)</p></details> |

Integrating over 300 million transaction records, 3,880 token profiles, global market indicators, and Reddit sentiment data from 2014-2024, it enables comprehensive studies on user behavior, market sentiment, and token performance. 3MEthTaskforce defines benchmarks for user behavior prediction and token price prediction tasks, using 6 dynamic graph networks and 19 time-series models to evaluate performance. Its multimodal design supports risk analysis and market fluctuation modeling, providing a valuable resource for advancing blockchain analytics and decentralized finance research.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Scenarios Generation-based Multiple Interval Prediction Method for Electricity Prices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08532v2)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.08532v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative interval prediction methodology aimed at addressing the limitations of current evaluation indicators while enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability. To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Vibration Forecasting for Advancing Rail Safety and Maintenance 4.0](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11730v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11730v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining railway axles is critical to preventing severe accidents and financial losses. The railway industry is increasingly interested in advanced condition monitoring techniques to enhance safety and efficiency, moving beyond traditional periodic inspections toward Maintenance 4.0. This study introduces a robust Deep Autoregressive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing systems to avert mechanical failures. Our approach simulates and predicts vibration signals under various conditions and fault scenarios, improving dataset robustness for more effective detection systems. These systems can alert maintenance needs, preventing accidents preemptively. We use experimental vibration signals from accelerometers on train axles. Our primary contributions include a transformer model, ShaftFormer, designed for processing time series data, and an alternative model incorporating spectral methods and enhanced observation models. Simulating vibration signals under diverse conditions mitigates the high cost of obtaining experimental signals for all scenarios. Given the non-stationary nature of railway vibration signals, influenced by speed and load changes, our models address these complexities, offering a powerful tool for predictive maintenance in the rail industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using dynamic loss weighting to boost improvements in forecast stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18267v2)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.18267v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rolling origin forecast instability refers to variability in forecasts for a specific period induced by updating the forecast when new data points become available. Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that existing dynamic loss weighting methods can achieve this objective and provide insights into why this might be the case. Additionally, we propose an extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- which also achieves this objective.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLinear-based Prediction of Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries: Feature Engineering through Explainable Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11542v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11542v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is essential for ensuring safety, reducing maintenance costs, and optimizing usage. However, predicting RUL is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics of the degradation caused by complex chemical reactions. Machine learning allows precise predictions by learning the latent functions of degradation relationships based on cycling behavior. This study introduces an accurate RUL prediction approach based on feature engineering and DLinear, applied to the dataset from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence. Among the 20 features generated from current, voltage, temperature, and time provided in this dataset, key features contributing to degradation are selected using Pearson correlation coefficient and Shapley values. Shapley value-based feature selection effectively reflects cell-to-cell variability, showing similar importance rankings across all cells. The DLinear-based RUL prediction using key features efficiently captures the time-series trend, demonstrating significantly better performance compared to Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Feature Construction for Anomaly Detection in Time Series -- An Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07999v2)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.07999v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To detect anomalies with precision and without prior knowledge in time series, is it better to build a detector from the initial temporal representation, or to compute a new (tabular) representation using an existing automatic variable construction library? In this article, we address this question by conducting an in-depth experimental study for two popular detectors (Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor). The obtained results, for 5 different datasets, show that the new representation, computed using the tsfresh library, allows Isolation Forest to significantly improve its performance.</p></details> | 7 |
| **[A Survey on Diffusion Models for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11430v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11430v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative AI models, showing remarkable potential in anomaly detection (AD) tasks across various domains, such as cybersecurity, fraud detection, healthcare, and manufacturing. The intersection of these two fields, termed diffusion models for anomaly detection (DMAD), offers promising solutions for identifying deviations in increasingly complex and high-dimensional data. In this survey, we systematically review recent advances in DMAD research and investigate their capabilities. We begin by presenting the fundamental concepts of AD and DMs, followed by a comprehensive analysis of classic DM architectures including DDPMs, DDIMs, and Score SDEs. We further categorize existing DMAD methods into reconstruction-based, density-based, and hybrid approaches, providing detailed examinations of their methodological innovations. We also explore the diverse tasks across different data modalities, encompassing image, time series, video, and multimodal data analysis. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges and emerging research directions, including computational efficiency, model interpretability, robustness enhancement, edge-cloud collaboration, and integration with large language models.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11414v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, regular paper</p></details> |
| **[On the Dimension of Pullback Attractors in Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11357v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11357v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive parameters identification for nonlinear dynamics using deep permutation invariant networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11350v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11350v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising outcomes of dynamical system identification techniques, such as SINDy [Brunton et al. 2016], highlight their advantages in providing qualitative interpretability and extrapolation compared to non-interpretable deep neural networks [Rudin 2019]. These techniques suffer from parameter updating in real-time use cases, especially when the system parameters are likely to change during or between processes. Recently, the OASIS [Bhadriraju et al. 2020] framework introduced a data-driven technique to address the limitations of real-time dynamical system parameters updating, yielding interesting results. Nevertheless, we show in this work that superior performance can be achieved using more advanced model architectures. We present an innovative encoding approach, based mainly on the use of Set Encoding methods of sequence data, which give accurate adaptive model identification for complex dynamic systems, with variable input time series length. Two Set Encoding methods are used, the first is Deep Set [Zaheer et al. 2017], and the second is Set Transformer [Lee et al. 2019]. Comparing Set Transformer to OASIS framework on Lotka Volterra for real-time local dynamical system identification and time series forecasting, we find that the Set Transformer architecture is well adapted to learning relationships within data sets. We then compare the two Set Encoding methods based on the Lorenz system for online global dynamical system identification. Finally, we trained a Deep Set model to perform identification and characterization of abnormalities for 1D heat-transfer problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Imputation of Urban Time Series through Cross-city Meta-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11306v1)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11306v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban time series, such as mobility flows, energy consumption, and pollution records, encapsulate complex urban dynamics and structures. However, data collection in each city is impeded by technical challenges such as budget limitations and sensor failures, necessitating effective data imputation techniques that can enhance data quality and reliability. Existing imputation models, categorized into learning-based and analytics-based paradigms, grapple with the trade-off between capacity and generalizability. Collaborative learning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of breaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and heterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and collaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs offer a continuous mapping from domain coordinates to target values, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. By imposing embedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle irregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system. We then introduce a cross-city collaborative learning scheme through model-agnostic meta learning, incorporating hierarchical modulation and normalization techniques to accommodate multiscale representations and reduce variance in response to heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on a diverse urban dataset from 20 global cities demonstrate our model's superior imputation performance and generalizability, underscoring the effectiveness of collaborative imputation in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

However, LQP faces significant challenges due to the dynamic and lossy nature of wireless links, which are influenced by interference, multipath effects, fading, and blockage. In this paper, we propose GAT-LLM, a novel multivariate wireless link quality prediction model that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to enable accurate and reliable multivariate LQP of wireless communications. By framing LQP as a time series prediction task and appropriately preprocessing the input data, we leverage LLMs to improve the accuracy of link quality prediction. To address the limitations of LLMs in multivariate prediction due to typically handling one-dimensional data, we integrate GAT to model interdependencies among multiple variables across different protocol layers, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GAT-LLM significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of link quality prediction, particularly in multi-step prediction scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Although these techniques are effective in certain tasks, they have yet to be generalized to time series benchmarks. We find that current data augmentation techniques ruin the core information contained within the frequency domain. To address this issue, we propose a simple strategy to preserve spectral information (SimPSI) in time series data augmentation. SimPSI preserves the spectral information by mixing the original and augmented input spectrum weighted by a preservation map, which indicates the importance score of each frequency. Specifically, our experimental contributions are to build three distinct preservation maps: magnitude spectrum, saliency map, and spectrum-preservative map. We apply SimPSI to various time series data augmentations and evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of time series benchmarks. Our experimental results support that SimPSI considerably enhances the performance of time series data augmentations by preserving core spectral information.

However, existing methods typically model the evolution of learning curves in isolation, neglecting the impact of neural network (NN) architectures, which influence the loss landscape and learning trajectories. In this work, we explore whether incorporating neural network architecture improves learning curve modeling and how to effectively integrate this architectural information. Motivated by the dynamical system view of optimization, we propose a novel architecture-aware neural differential equation model to forecast learning curves continuously. We empirically demonstrate its ability to capture the general trend of fluctuating learning curves while quantifying uncertainty through variational parameters. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art learning curve extrapolation methods and pure time-series modeling approaches for both MLP and CNN-based learning curves. Additionally, we explore the applicability of our method in Neural Architecture Search scenarios, such as training configuration ranking.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI'25 |
| **[Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16144v2)** | 2025-01-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2403.16144v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.</p></details> |  |

However, the impact of the specific choice of probability path model on forecasting performance remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that forecasting spatio-temporal data with flow matching is highly sensitive to the selection of the probability path model. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel probability path model designed to improve forecasting performance. Our empirical results across various dynamical system benchmarks show that our model achieves faster convergence during training and improved predictive performance compared to existing probability path models. Importantly, our approach is efficient during inference, requiring only a few sampling steps. This makes our proposed model practical for real-world applications and opens new avenues for probabilistic forecasting.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Part of the SAVEE and RAVDESS datasets are selected and combined as the dataset, containing seven sorts of common emotions (i.e. happy, neutral, sad, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise) and thousands of samples. Based on the Librosa package, this paper processes the initial audio input into waveplot and spectrum for analysis and concentrates on multiple features including MFCC as targets for feature extraction. The hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture is adopted by virtue of its strong capability to deal with sequential data and time series, which mainly consists of four convolutional layers and three long short-term memory layers. As a result, the architecture achieved an accuracy of 61.07% comprehensively for the test set, among which the detection of anger and neutral reaches a performance of 75.31% and 71.70% respectively. It can also be concluded that the classification accuracy is dependent on the properties of emotion to some extent, with frequently-used and distinct-featured emotions having less probability to be misclassified into other categories. Emotions like surprise whose meaning depends on the specific context are more likely to confuse with positive or negative emotions, and negative emotions also have a possibility to get mixed with each other.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, Applied and Computational Engineering</p></details> |

Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

This study validates the Markov properties of vehicle trajectories for both Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). A statistical method used to test whether time series data exhibits Markov properties is applied to examine whether the trajectory data possesses Markov characteristics. t test and F test are additionally introduced to characterize the differences in Markov properties between AVs and HVs. Based on two public trajectory datasets, we investigate the presence and order of the Markov property of different types of vehicles through rigorous statistical tests. Our findings reveal that AV trajectories generally exhibit stronger Markov properties compared to HV trajectories, with a higher percentage conforming to the Markov property and lower Markov orders. In contrast, HV trajectories display greater variability and heterogeneity in decision-making processes, reflecting the complex perception and information processing involved in human driving. These results have significant implications for the development of driving behavior models, AV controllers, and traffic simulation systems. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of using statistical methods to test the presence of Markov properties in driving trajectory data.</p></details> |  |

We find that VLMs produce competitive results after two or less epochs of fine-tuning. We develop a novel approach that incorporates graphical data representations as images in conjunction with numerical data. This approach is rooted in the hypothesis that graphical representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks. Our approach works with univariate and multivariate time-series data. In addition, we conduct extensive and practical experiments to show how this approach works for time-series classification and generative labels.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise and adapting to shifts in the data distribution by aligning its predictions with actual future outcomes. This feedback loop allows the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters, focusing on persistent features despite changes in the data. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 48.7% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems. By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism adaptable to data drift, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.

However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has focused on creating increasingly efficient intervals, we argue that standard measures alone are inadequate. Beyond efficiency, prediction intervals must adapt their width based on the difficulty of the prediction while preserving coverage regardless of complexity. To address these issues, we propose combining Heteroscedastic Quantile Regression (HQR) with Width-Adaptive Conformal Inference (WACI). This integrated procedure guarantees theoretical coverage and enables interval widths to vary with predictive uncertainty. We assess its performance using both a synthetic example and a real world Electricity Price Forecasting scenario. Our results show that this combined approach meets or surpasses typical benchmarks for validity and efficiency, while also fulfilling important yet often overlooked practical requirements.</p></details> |  |

Climate patterns, for example, shift over time with recurring seasonal trends, while also depending on geographical characteristics such as ecosystem variability. Existing methods for discovering causal graphs from time series either assume stationarity, do not permit both temporal and spatial distribution changes, or are unaware of locations with the same causal relationships. In this work, we therefore unify the three tasks of causal graph discovery in the non-stationary multi-context setting, of reconstructing temporal regimes, and of partitioning datasets and time intervals into those where invariant causal relationships hold. To construct a consistent score that forms the basis of our method, we employ the Minimum Description Length principle. Our resulting algorithm SPACETIME simultaneously accounts for heterogeneity across space and non-stationarity over time. Given multiple time series, it discovers regime changepoints and a temporal causal graph using non-parametric functional modeling and kernelized discrepancy testing. We also show that our method provides insights into real-world phenomena such as river-runoff measured at different catchments and biosphere-atmosphere interactions across ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate these models across multiple time horizons and user categories, with a focus on the impact of historical context length. Our analysis reveals that while Chronos demonstrates superior performance for longer-term predictions and maintains accuracy with increased context, traditional models show significant degradation as context length increases. We find that prediction quality varies systematically between user classes, suggesting that underlying behavior patterns always influence model performance. This study provides a case for deploying Chronos in real-world applications where limited model tuning is feasible, especially in scenarios requiring longer prediction.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series (SITS). Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |

In this study, we adopt an efficient two-level clustering approach to automatically identify seasons using the clear sky irradiance in first level and subsequently to identify daily cloud level as clear, cloudy and partly cloudy within each season in second level. In the second level of clustering, three methods are compared, namely, Daily Irradiance Index (DII or $\beta$), Euclidean Distance (ED), and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. The DII is computed as the ratio of time integral of measured irradiance to time integral of the clear sky irradiance. The identified clusters were compared quantitatively using established clustering metrics and qualitatively by comparing the mean irradiance profiles. The results clearly establish the superiority of the $\beta$-based clustering approach as the leader, setting a new benchmark for solar irradiance clustering studies. Moreover, $\beta$-based clustering remains effective even for annual data unlike the time-series methods which suffer significant performance degradation. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, ED-based clustering outperforms the more compute-intensive DTW distance-based clustering. The method has been rigorously validated using data from two distinct US locations, demonstrating robust scalability for larger datasets and potential applicability for other locations.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Secondary crashes constitute only a small proportion of all crashes. These secondary crashes, triggered by primary crashes, significantly exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the severity of incidents. However, the severe imbalance of secondary crash data poses significant challenges for prediction models, affecting their generalization ability and prediction accuracy. Existing methods fail to fully address the complexity of traffic crash data, particularly the coexistence of dynamic and static features, and often struggle to effectively handle data samples of varying lengths. Furthermore, most current studies predict the occurrence probability and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes separately, lacking an integrated solution. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model named VarFusiGAN-Transformer, aimed at improving the fidelity of secondary crash data generation and jointly predicting the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. The VarFusiGAN-Transformer model employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the generation of multivariate long-time series data, incorporating a static data generator and an auxiliary discriminator to model the joint distribution of dynamic and static features. In addition, the model's prediction module achieves simultaneous prediction of both the occurrence and spatiotemporal distribution of secondary crashes. Compared to existing methods, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance in generating high-fidelity data and improving prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Since the relationship among variables in MTS usually contain crucial cues, a large number of graph-based MTSC approaches have been proposed, as the graph topology and edges can explicitly represent relationships among variables (channels), where not only various MTS graph representation learning strategies but also different Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been explored. Despite such progresses, there is no comprehensive study that fairly benchmarks and investigates the performances of existing widely-used graph representation learning strategies/GNN classifiers in the application of different MTSC tasks. In this paper, we present the first benchmark which systematically investigates the effectiveness of the widely-used three node feature definition strategies, four edge feature learning strategies and five GNN architecture, resulting in 60 different variants for graph-based MTSC. These variants are developed and evaluated with a standardized data pipeline and training/validation/testing strategy on 26 widely-used suspensor MTSC datasets. Our experiments highlight that node features significantly influence MTSC performance, while the visualization of edge features illustrates why adaptive edge learning outperforms other edge feature learning methods.

Proficiency in database query languages is pivotal for crafting effective queries. As coding assistants become more prevalent, there is significant opportunity to enhance database query languages. The Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a widely used query language for large semi-structured data such as logs, telemetries, and time-series for big data analytics platforms. This paper introduces NL2KQL an innovative framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to convert natural language queries (NLQs) to KQL queries. The proposed NL2KQL framework includes several key components: Schema Refiner which narrows down the schema to its most pertinent elements; the Few-shot Selector which dynamically selects relevant examples from a few-shot dataset; and the Query Refiner which repairs syntactic and semantic errors in KQL queries. Additionally, this study outlines a method for generating large datasets of synthetic NLQ-KQL pairs which are valid within a specific database contexts. To validate NL2KQL's performance, we utilize an array of online (based on query execution) and offline (based on query parsing) metrics. Through ablation studies, the significance of each framework component is examined, and the datasets used for benchmarking are made publicly available. This work is the first of its kind and is compared with available baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge hindering the adoption of RL methods in these domains is the non-robustness of conventional algorithms. In particular, the focus of RL is typically on the expected value of the return. The expected value is the average over the statistical ensemble of infinitely many trajectories, which can be uninformative about the performance of the average individual. For instance, when we have a heavy-tailed return distribution, the ensemble average can be dominated by rare extreme events. Consequently, optimizing the expected value can lead to policies that yield exceptionally high returns with a probability that approaches zero but almost surely result in catastrophic outcomes in single long trajectories. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that lets RL agents optimize the long-term performance of individual trajectories. The algorithm enables the agents to learn robust policies, which we show in an instructive example with a heavy-tailed return distribution and standard RL benchmarks. The key element of the algorithm is a transformation that we learn from data. This transformation turns the time series of collected returns into one for whose increments expected value and the average over a long trajectory coincide. Optimizing these increments results in robust policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted final version to appear in the Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

While previous studies have explored the use of imagined speech with semantically meaningful words for subject identification, most have relied on additional visual or auditory cues. In this study, we introduce a cueless EEG-based imagined speech paradigm, where subjects imagine the pronunciation of semantically meaningful words without any external cues. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of prior methods by requiring subjects to select and imagine words from a predefined list naturally. The dataset comprises over 4,350 trials from 11 subjects across five sessions. We assess a variety of classification methods, including traditional machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, as well as time-series foundation models and deep learning architectures specifically designed for EEG classification, such as EEG Conformer and Shallow ConvNet. A session-based hold-out validation strategy was employed to ensure reliable evaluation and prevent data leakage. Our results demonstrate outstanding classification accuracy, reaching 97.93%. These findings highlight the potential of cueless EEG paradigms for secure and reliable subject identification in real-world applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).</p></details> |  |

With this increase in model complexity, however, comes a lack in understanding of the underlying model decision process, which is problematic for high-stakes application scenarios. At the same time, simple, interpretable forecasting methods such as ARIMA still perform very well, sometimes on-par, with Deep Learning approaches. We argue that simple models are good enough most of the time, and that forecasting performance could be improved by choosing a Deep Learning method only for few, important predictions, increasing the overall interpretability of the forecasting process. In this context, we propose a novel online model selection framework which learns to identify these predictions. An extensive empirical study on various real-world datasets shows that our selection methodology performs comparable to state-of-the-art online model selections methods in most cases while being significantly more interpretable. We find that almost always choosing a simple autoregressive linear model for forecasting results in competitive performance, suggesting that the need for opaque black-box models in time-series forecasting might be smaller than recent works would suggest.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by modelling the weights of a neural network as the hidden states of a Hidden Markov model, with the observed process defined by the available data. A filtering algorithm is employed to learn a variational approximation of the evolving-in-time posterior distribution over the weights. By leveraging a sequential variant of Bayes by Backprop, enriched with a stronger regularization technique called variational DropConnect, Hidden Markov Neural Networks achieve robust regularization and scalable inference. Experiments on MNIST, dynamic classification tasks, and next-frame forecasting in videos demonstrate that Hidden Markov Neural Networks provide strong predictive performance while enabling effective uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies have faced challenges in generating accurate and semantically rich summaries of time-series data charts. In this paper, we identify summary elements and common hallucination types in the generation of time-series chart summaries, which serve as our guidelines for automatic generation. We introduce ChartInsighter, which automatically generates chart summaries of time-series data, effectively reducing hallucinations in chart summary generation. Specifically, we assign multiple agents to generate the initial chart summary and collaborate iteratively, during which they invoke external data analysis modules to extract insights and compile them into a coherent summary. Additionally, we implement a self-consistency test method to validate and correct our summary. We create a high-quality benchmark of charts and summaries, with hallucination types annotated on a sentence-by-sentence basis, facilitating the evaluation of the effectiveness of reducing hallucinations. Our evaluations using our benchmark show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art models, and that our summary hallucination rate is the lowest, which effectively reduces various hallucinations and improves summary quality.

However, their implementation often suffers from poor training stability and heavy trainable parameter. Furthermore, there is limited understanding of the behavior of the learned activation functions derived from B-splines. In this work, we analyze the behavior of KANs through the lens of spline knots and derive the lower and upper bound for the number of knots in B-spline-based KANs. To address existing limitations, we propose a novel Free Knots KAN that enhances the performance of the original KAN while reducing the number of trainable parameters to match the trainable parameter scale of standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Additionally, we introduce new a training strategy to ensure $C^2$ continuity of the learnable spline, resulting in smoother activation compared to the original KAN and improve the training stability by range expansion. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on 8 datasets spanning various domains, including image, text, time series, multimodal, and function approximation tasks. The promising results demonstrates the feasibility of KAN-based network and the effectiveness of proposed method.</p></details> |  |

These methods utilize Fourier transformations to shift signals between time and frequency domains. However, since Fourier transformations span the entire time-domain signal, they are suboptimal for non-stationary time series. We introduce Short-Time Variational Mode Decomposition (STVMD), an innovative extension of the VMD algorithm that incorporates the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) to minimize the impact of local disturbances. STVMD segments signals into short time windows, converting these segments into the frequency domain. It then formulates a variational optimization problem to extract band-limited modes representing the windowed data. The optimization aims to minimize the sum of the bandwidths of these modes across the windowed data, extending the cost functions used in VMD and MVMD. Solutions are derived using the alternating direction method of multipliers, ensuring the extraction of modes with narrow bandwidths. STVMD is divided into dynamic and non-dynamic types, depending on whether the central frequencies vary with time. Our experiments show that non-dynamic STVMD is comparable to VMD with properly sized time windows, while dynamic STVMD better accommodates non-stationary signals, evidenced by reduced mode function errors and tracking of dynamic central frequencies. This effectiveness is validated by steady-state visual-evoked potentials in electroencephalogram signals.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an invaluable tool for disturbance mapping, providing consistent time-series images of the ground regardless of weather or illumination conditions. Despite SAR's potential for disturbance mapping, processing SAR data to an analysis-ready format requires expertise and significant compute resources, particularly for large-scale global analysis. In October 2023, NASA's Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project released the near-global Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR backscatter from Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) dataset, providing publicly available, analysis-ready SAR imagery. In this work, we utilize this new dataset to systematically analyze land surface disturbances. As labeling SAR data is often prohibitively time-consuming, we train a self-supervised vision transformer - which requires no labels to train - on OPERA RTC-S1 data to estimate a per-pixel distribution from the set of baseline imagery and assess disturbances when there is significant deviation from the modeled distribution. To test our model's capability and generality, we evaluate three different natural disasters - which represent high-intensity, abrupt disturbances - from three different regions of the world. Across events, our approach yields high quality delineations: F1 scores exceeding 0.6 and Areas Under the Precision-Recall Curve exceeding 0.65, consistently outperforming existing SAR disturbance methods. Our findings suggest that a self-supervised vision transformer is well-suited for global disturbance mapping and can be a valuable tool for operational, near-global disturbance monitoring, particularly when labeled data does not exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables.

An initially non-interpretable predictive model to improve the forecast of a classical time-series 'base model' is used.

We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the potential of the method to discover and explain underlying patterns in the data.</p></details> |  |

Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Reliability journal</p></details> |

By extracting base weights from KAN layers and incorporating the sparsity-inducing penalty along with ridge regularization, GCKAN infers the Granger causality from time series while enabling automatic time lag selection. Additionally, we propose an algorithm leveraging time-reversed Granger causality to enhance inference accuracy. The algorithm compares prediction and sparse-inducing losses derived from the original and time-reversed series, automatically selecting the casual relationship with the higher score or integrating the results to mitigate spurious connectivities. Comprehensive experiments conducted on Lorenz-96, gene regulatory networks, fMRI BOLD signals, and VAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods in inferring Granger causality from nonlinear, high-dimensional, and limited-sample time series.</p></details> |  |

A large contributor to its popularity is the sense of immersion and interactivity enabled by having real-world motion reflected in the virtual experience accurately and immediately. This user motion, mainly caused by head rotations, induces several technical challenges. For instance, which content is generated and transmitted depends heavily on where the user is looking. Seamless systems, taking user motion into account proactively, will therefore require accurate predictions of upcoming rotations. Training and evaluating such predictors requires vast amounts of orientational input data, which is expensive to gather, as it requires human test subjects. A more feasible approach is to gather a modest dataset through test subjects, and then extend it to a more sizeable set using synthetic data generation methods. In this work, we present a head rotation time series generator based on TimeGAN, an extension of the well-known Generative Adversarial Network, designed specifically for generating time series. This approach is able to extend a dataset of head rotations with new samples closely matching the distribution of the measured time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published and presented at International Conference on Multimedia 2022 (ACMMM), Workshop on Interactive eXtended Reality (IXR)</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08628v1)** | 2025-01-15 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.08628v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data. Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance. Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both detection and localization tasks.</p></details> |  |

This study develops and evaluates an advanced deep learning model, Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), to forecast the power output of photovoltaic and wind energy systems using annual offshore wind power, onshore wind power, and solar power generation data from Denmark. While the original Patch Time-Series Transformer(PatchTST) model employs a channel-independent (CI) approach, it tends to overlook inter-channel relationships during training, potentially leading to a loss of critical information. To address this limitation and further leverage the benefits of increased data granularity brought by CI, we propose CT-PatchTST. This enhanced model improves the processing of inter-channel information while maintaining the advantages of the channel-independent approach. The predictive performance of CT-PatchTST is rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its ability to provide precise and reliable energy forecasts. This work contributes to improving the predictability of renewable energy systems, supporting their broader adoption and integration into energy grids.</p></details> |  |

Typically, feature computation is divided into two distinct phases, i.e., offline stage for model training and online stage for model serving. These phases often rely on execution engines with different interface languages and function implementations, causing significant inconsistencies. Moreover, many online ML features involve complex time-series computations (e.g., functions over varied-length table windows) that differ from standard streaming and analytical queries. Existing data processing systems (e.g., Spark, Flink, DuckDB) often incur multi-second latencies for these computations, making them unsuitable for real-time online ML applications that demand timely feature updates. This paper presents OpenMLDB, a feature computation system deployed in 4Paradigm's SageOne platform and over 100 real scenarios. Technically, OpenMLDB first employs a unified query plan generator for consistent computation results across the offline and online stages, significantly reducing feature deployment overhead. Second, OpenMLDB provides an online execution engine that resolves performance bottlenecks caused by long window computations (via pre-aggregation) and multi-table window unions (via data self-adjusting). It also provides a high-performance offline execution engine with window parallel optimization and time-aware data skew resolving. Third, OpenMLDB features a compact data format and stream-focused indexing to maximize memory usage and accelerate data access. Evaluations in testing and real workloads reveal significant performance improvements and resource savings compared to the baseline systems. The open community of OpenMLDB now has over 150 contributors and gained 1.6k stars on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Besides the mirroring of the physical word into the digital, there is the need of providing services related to the data collected and transferred to the virtual world. One of these services is the forecasting of physical part future behavior, that could lead to applications, like preventing harmful events or designing improvements to get better performance. One strategy used to predict any system operation it is the use of time series models like ARIMA or LSTM, and improvements were implemented using these algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been proposed to create time series and the use of LSTM has gained more relevance in time series forecasting, but both have limitations that restrict the forecasting results. Another issue found in the literature is the challenge of handling multivariate environments/applications in time series generation. Therefore, new methods need to be studied in order to fill these gaps and, consequently, provide better resources for creating useful digital twins. In this proposal, it is going to be studied the integration of a BiLSTM layer with a time series obtained by GAN in order to improve the forecasting of all the features provided by the dataset in terms of accuracy and, consequently, improving behaviour prediction.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.12372v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists. Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models. Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON2025), London, UK, 22-25 April, 2025</p></details> |

However, as jailbreak attacks continue to circumvent built-in safety mechanisms, exploiting carefully crafted scenarios or tokens, the safety risks of LLMs have come into focus. While numerous defense strategies--such as prompt detection, modification, and model fine-tuning--have been proposed to counter these attacks, a critical question arises: do these defenses compromise the utility and usability of LLMs for legitimate users? Existing research predominantly focuses on the effectiveness of defense strategies without thoroughly examining their impact on performance, leaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs between LLM safety and performance. Our research addresses this gap by conducting a comprehensive study on the utility degradation, safety elevation, and exaggerated-safety escalation of LLMs with jailbreak defense strategies. We propose USEBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate these aspects, along with USEIndex, a comprehensive metric for assessing overall model performance. Through experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, we found that mainstream jailbreak defenses fail to ensure both safety and performance simultaneously. Although model-finetuning performs the best overall, their effectiveness varies across LLMs. Furthermore, vertical comparisons reveal that developers commonly prioritize performance over safety when iterating or fine-tuning their LLMs.</p></details> |  |

AdaServe leverages the logits of a draft model to predict the speculative accuracy of tokens and employs a theoretically optimal algorithm to construct token trees for verification. To accommodate diverse SLO requirements without compromising throughput, AdaServe employs a speculation-and-selection scheme that first constructs candidate token trees for each request and then dynamically selects tokens to meet individual SLO constraints while optimizing throughput. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AdaServe achieves up to 73% higher SLO attainment and 74% higher goodput compared to state-of-the-art systems. These results underscore AdaServe's potential to enhance the efficiency and adaptability of LLM deployments across varied application scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Here, we examine how different LLM-generated explanations for movie recommendations affect users' perceptions of cognitive, affective, and utilitarian needs and consumption intentions. In a pre-registered, between-subject online experiment (N=759) and follow-up interviews (N=30), we compare (a) LLM-generated generic explanations, and (b) LLM-generated contextualized explanations. Our findings show that contextualized explanations (i.e., explanations that incorporate users' past behaviors) effectively meet users' cognitive needs while increasing users' intentions to watch recommended movies. However, adding explanations offers limited benefits in meeting users' utilitarian and affective needs, raising concerns about the proper design and implications of LLM-generated explanations. Qualitative insights from interviews reveal that referencing users' past preferences enhances trust and understanding but can feel excessive if overused. Furthermore, users with more active and positive engagement with the recommender system and movie-watching get substantial gains from contextualized explanations. Overall, our research clarifies how LLM-generated recommendations influence users' motivations and behaviors, providing valuable insights for the future development of user-centric recommender systems, a key element in social media platforms and online ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike reuse from the Web, LLMs are limited in providing provenance information about the generated code, which may have important trustworthiness and legal consequences. While LLM-based assistants may provide external links that are "related" to the generated code, we do not know how relevant such links are. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study assessing the extent to which 243 and 194 code snippets, across six programming languages, generated by Bing CoPilot and Google Gemini, likely originate from the links provided by these two LLM-based assistants. The study leverages automated code similarity assessments with thorough manual analysis. The study's findings indicate that the LLM-based assistants provide a mix of relevant and irrelevant links having a different nature. Specifically, although 66% of the links from Bing CoPilot and 28% from Google Gemini are relevant, LLMs-based assistants still suffer from serious "provenance debt".</p></details> |  |

In practice, when encountering unpredictable behavior of people or unexpected states of the environment, these frameworks may lack the ability to dynamically recognize such states, adapt and recover to resume the interaction. Large Language Models (LLMs), owing to their advanced reasoning capabilities and context retention, present a promising solution for enhancing robot adaptability. This potential, however, may not directly translate to improved interaction metrics. This paper considers a representative interaction with an industrial robot involving approach, instruction, and object manipulation, implemented in two conditions: (1) fully scripted and (2) including LLM-enhanced responses. We use gaze tracking and questionnaires to measure the participants' task efficiency, engagement, and robot perception. The results indicate higher subjective ratings for the LLM condition, but objective metrics show that the scripted condition performs comparably, particularly in efficiency and focus during simple tasks. We also note that the scripted condition may have an edge over LLM-enhanced responses in terms of response latency and energy consumption, especially for trivial and repetitive interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Late-Breaking Report to the 2025, 20th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</p></details> |
| **[QROA: A Black-Box Query-Response Optimization Attack on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02044v2)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.02044v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have surged in popularity in recent months, yet they possess concerning capabilities for generating harmful content when manipulated. This study introduces the Query-Response Optimization Attack (QROA), an optimization-based strategy designed to exploit LLMs through a black-box, query-only interaction. QROA adds an optimized trigger to a malicious instruction to compel the LLM to generate harmful content. Unlike previous approaches, QROA does not require access to the model's logit information or any other internal data and operates solely through the standard query-response interface of LLMs. Inspired by deep Q-learning and Greedy coordinate descent, the method iteratively updates tokens to maximize a designed reward function. We tested our method on various LLMs such as Vicuna, Falcon, and Mistral, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) over 80\%. We also tested the model against Llama2-chat, the fine-tuned version of Llama2 designed to resist Jailbreak attacks, achieving good ASR with a suboptimal initial trigger seed. This study demonstrates the feasibility of generating jailbreak attacks against deployed LLMs in the public domain using black-box optimization methods, enabling more comprehensive safety testing of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains unclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while learning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online self-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating AI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods research, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how CS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional online methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students approach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students found it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods than using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use more keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend to explicitly ask for information.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities, generating significant research interest in their application for reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Existing LLM-based methods have integrated retrieved historical facts or static graph representations into LLMs. Despite the notable performance of LLM-based methods, they are limited by the insufficient modeling of temporal patterns and ineffective cross-modal alignment between graph and language, hindering the ability of LLMs to fully grasp the temporal and structural information in TKGs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework TGL-LLM to integrate temporal graph learning into LLM-based temporal knowledge graph model. Specifically, we introduce temporal graph learning to capture the temporal and relational patterns and obtain the historical graph embedding. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph tokenization to sufficiently model the temporal patterns within LLMs. To achieve better alignment between graph and language, we employ a two-stage training paradigm to finetune LLMs on high-quality and diverse data, thereby resulting in better performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their potential, existing works face challenges when applying LLMs to medical settings. Strategies relying on training with medical datasets are highly cost-intensive and may suffer from outdated training data. Leveraging external knowledge bases is a suitable alternative, yet it faces obstacles such as limited retrieval precision and poor effectiveness in answer extraction. These issues collectively prevent LLMs from demonstrating the expected level of proficiency in mastering medical expertise. To address these challenges, we introduce Med-R^2, a novel LLM physician framework that adheres to the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) process, efficiently integrating retrieval mechanisms as well as the selection and reasoning processes of evidence, thereby enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs in healthcare scenarios and fostering a trustworthy LLM physician. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Med-R^2 achieves a 14.87\% improvement over vanilla RAG methods and even a 3.59\% enhancement compared to fine-tuning strategies, without incurring additional training costs.</p></details> |  |

In addition to training-time scaling, recent studies have revealed that increasing test-time computational resources can further improve performance. In this work, we introduce Aggregation Fine-Tuning (AFT), a supervised finetuning paradigm where the model learns to synthesize multiple draft responses, referred to as proposals, into a single, refined answer, termed aggregation. At inference time, a propose-and-aggregate strategy further boosts performance by iteratively generating proposals and aggregating them. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that AFT-trained models substantially outperform standard SFT. Notably, an AFT model, fine-tuned from Llama3.1-8B-Base with only 64k data, achieves a 41.3% LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2, surpassing significantly larger LLMs such as Llama3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT4. By combining sequential refinement and parallel sampling, the propose-and-aggregate framework scales inference-time computation in a flexible manner. Overall, These findings position AFT as a promising approach to unlocking additional capabilities of LLMs without resorting to increasing data volume or model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages; work in progress</p></details> |

However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different 'examtaker models' - both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores.</p></details> |  |

While various sUAS simulation tools exist to support developers, the entire process of creating, executing, and analyzing simulation tests remains a largely manual and cumbersome task. Developers must identify test scenarios, set up the simulation environment, integrate the System under Test (SuT) with simulation tools, formulate mission plans, and collect and analyze results. These labor-intensive tasks limit the ability of developers to conduct exhaustive testing across a wide range of scenarios. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose AutoSimTest, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven framework, where multiple LLM agents collaborate to support the sUAS simulation testing process. This includes: (1) creating test scenarios that subject the SuT to unique environmental contexts; (2) preparing the simulation environment as per the test scenario; (3) generating diverse sUAS missions for the SuT to execute; and (4) analyzing simulation results and providing an interactive analytics interface. Further, the design of the framework is flexible for creating and testing scenarios for a variety of sUAS use cases, simulation tools, and SuT input requirements. We evaluated our approach by (a) conducting simulation testing of PX4 and ArduPilot flight-controller-based SuTs, (b) analyzing the performance of each agent, and (c) gathering feedback from sUAS developers. Our findings indicate that AutoSimTest significantly improves the efficiency and scope of the sUAS testing process, allowing for more comprehensive and varied scenario evaluations while reducing the manual effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper at ICSE-2025</p></details> |

However, LLMs often generate code that is syntactically correct and even semantically plausible, but may not execute as expected or fulfill specified requirements. This phenomenon of hallucinations in the code domain has not been systematically explored. To advance the community's understanding and research on this issue, we introduce the concept of code hallucinations and propose a classification method for code hallucination based on execution verification. We categorize code hallucinations into four main types: mapping, naming, resource, and logic hallucinations, with each category further divided into different subcategories to understand and address the unique challenges faced by LLMs in code generation with finer granularity. Additionally, we present a dynamic detection algorithm called CodeHalu designed to detect and quantify code hallucinations. We also introduce the CodeHaluEval benchmark, which includes 8,883 samples from 699 tasks, to systematically and quantitatively evaluate code hallucinations. By evaluating 17 popular LLMs using this benchmark, we reveal significant differences in their accuracy and reliability in code generation, offering detailed insights for further improving the code generation capabilities of LLMs. The CodeHalu benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/yuchen814/CodeHalu.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to responses with the highest rewards, which are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. This dataset is easily integrated with existing direct alignment algorithms and is applicable to any preference dataset. The experimental results across instruction-following benchmarks including AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard-Auto demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts the performance of DPO by a considerable margin across diverse models. Additionally, our method improves the average accuracy on various academic benchmarks. When applying our method to on-policy data, the resulting DPO model achieves SOTA results on AlpacaEval. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere dataset expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.</p></details> |  |

Investigative study on how mental sets affect the reasoning capabilities of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11833v1)** | 2025-01-21 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.11833v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an investigative study on how Mental Sets influence the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have excelled in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks, driven by advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and emergent capabilities like in-context learning (ICL). For complex reasoning tasks, selecting the right model for PEFT or ICL is critical, often relying on scores on benchmarks such as MMLU, MATH, and GSM8K. However, current evaluation methods, based on metrics like F1 Score or reasoning chain assessments by larger models, overlook a key dimension: adaptability to unfamiliar situations and overcoming entrenched thinking patterns. In cognitive psychology, Mental Set refers to the tendency to persist with previously successful strategies, even when they become inefficient - a challenge for problem solving and reasoning. We compare the performance of LLM models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o in the presence of mental sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate cognitive psychology concepts into the evaluation of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, providing deeper insights into their adaptability and problem-solving efficacy.</p></details> |  |

A major bottleneck arises from the attention mechanism, which requires storing large key-value caches, limiting the maximum achievable throughput way below the available computing resources. Current approaches attempt to mitigate this issue through memory-efficient attention and paging mechanisms, but remained constrained by the assumption that all operations must be performed on high-end accelerators. In this work, we propose Glinthawk, a two-tiered architecture that decouples the attention mechanism from the rest of the Transformer model. This approach allows the memory requirements for attention to scale independently, enabling larger batch sizes and more efficient use of the high-end accelerators. We prototype Glinthawk with NVIDIA T4 GPUs as one tier and standard CPU VMs as the other. Compared to a traditional single-tier setup, it improves throughput by $5.9\times$ and reduces cost of generation by $2.8\times$. For longer sequence lengths, it achieves $16.3\times$ throughput improvement at $2.4\times$ less cost. Our evaluation shows that this architecture can tolerate moderate network latency with minimal performance degradation, making it highly effective for latency-tolerant, throughput-oriented applications such as batch processing. We shared our prototype publicly at \url{https://github.com/microsoft/glinthawk}.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging larger datasets requires balancing quality, quantity, and diversity across sources. After evaluating nine baseline methods under both compute- and data-constrained scenarios, we find token-count heuristics outperform manual and learned mixes, indicating that simple approaches accounting for dataset size and diversity are surprisingly effective. Building on this insight, we propose two complementary approaches: UtiliMax, which extends token-based heuristics by incorporating utility estimates from reduced-scale ablations, achieving up to a 10.6x speedup over manual baselines; and Model Estimated Data Utility (MEDU), which leverages LLMs to estimate data utility from small samples, matching ablation-based performance while reducing computational requirements by $\sim$200x. Together, these approaches establish a new framework for automated, compute-efficient data mixing that is robust across training regimes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, the extent to which these models truly comprehend the concepts they articulate remains unclear. To assess the level of comprehension of a model relative to the content it generates, we implemented a self-evaluation pipeline where models: (i) given a topic generate an excerpt with information about the topic, (ii) given an excerpt generate question-answer pairs, and finally (iii) given a question generate an answer. We refer to this self-evaluation approach as Explain-Query-Test (EQT). Interestingly, the accuracy on generated questions resulting from running the EQT pipeline correlates strongly with the model performance as verified by typical benchmarks such as MMLU-Pro. In other words, EQT's performance is predictive of MMLU-Pro's, and EQT can be used to rank models without the need for any external source of evaluation data other than lists of topics of interest. Moreover, our results reveal a disparity between the models' ability to produce detailed explanations and their performance on questions related to those explanations. This gap highlights fundamental limitations in the internal knowledge representation and reasoning abilities of current LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/asgsaeid/EQT.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their widespread use, significant challenges persist in the quality of LLM responses to issue resolution queries. LLM interactions often yield incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous information, largely due to knowledge gaps in prompt design, which can lead to unproductive exchanges and reduced developer productivity. In this paper, we analyze 433 developer-ChatGPT conversations within GitHub issue threads to examine the impact of prompt knowledge gaps and conversation styles on issue resolution. We identify four main knowledge gaps in developer prompts: Missing Context, Missing Specifications, Multiple Context, and Unclear Instructions. Assuming that conversations within closed issues contributed to successful resolutions while those in open issues did not, we find that ineffective conversations contain knowledge gaps in 54.7% of prompts, compared to only 13.2% in effective ones. Additionally, we observe seven distinct conversational styles, with Directive Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Responsive Feedback being the most prevalent. We find that knowledge gaps are present in all styles of conversations, with Missing Context being the most repeated challenge developers face in issue-resolution conversations. Based on our analysis, we identify key textual and code related heuristics-Specificity, Contextual Richness, and Clarity-that are associated with successful issue closure and help assess prompt quality. These heuristics lay the foundation for an automated tool that can dynamically flag unclear prompts and suggest structured improvements. To test feasibility, we developed a lightweight browser extension prototype for detecting prompt gaps, that can be easily adapted to other tools within developer workflows.</p></details> |  |

Considering the tabular form of the data, two types of experiments are executed: one where the images are split line by line and the other where the entire scan is used as input. Based on CER and BLEU, we demonstrate that LLMs outperform the conventional OCR/HTR methods. Moreover, we also compare the evaluated CER and BLEU scores to human evaluations to better judge the outputs of whole-scan experiments and understand influential factors for CER and BLEU. Combining judgments from all the evaluation metrics, we conclude that two-shot GPT-4o for line-by-line images and two-shot Claude Sonnet 3.5 for whole-scan images yield the transcriptions of the historical records most similar to the ground truth.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, effective strategies for fine-tuning LLMs for the QA task remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we categorize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data based on the extent of knowledge memorized by the pretrained LLMs and conduct a series of empirical analyses. Our experiments, involving four LLMs from three different model families, focus on three key factors: the amount of data required for SFT, the impact of different SFT datasets on model performance, and how data requirements vary across LLMs. The results show that as few as 60 data points during the SFT stage can activate the knowledge encoded during pre-training, enabling LLMs to perform the QA task. Additionally, SFT with data of varying memory levels has a significant impact on LLM performance, with the optimal dataset differing based on the specific model being fine-tuned. Future research will delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.</p></details> |  |

However, the high volume of data shared on these platforms makes reviewing each individual case challenging. Therefore, a summarization algorithm capable of processing and understanding various Indian code-mixed languages is essential. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in NLP tasks, including summarization. LLMs inherently produce abstractive summaries by paraphrasing the original text, while the generation of extractive summaries - selecting specific subsets from the original text - through LLMs remains largely unexplored. Moreover, LLMs have a limited context window size, restricting the amount of data that can be processed at once. We tackle these challenge by introducing LaMSUM, a novel multi-level framework designed to generate extractive summaries for large collections of Safe City posts using LLMs. LaMSUM integrates summarization with different voting methods to achieve robust summaries. Extensive evaluation using three popular LLMs (Llama, Mistral and GPT-4o) demonstrates that LaMSUM outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarization methods for Safe City posts. Overall, this work represents one of the first attempts to achieve extractive summarization through LLMs, and is likely to support stakeholders by offering a comprehensive overview and enabling them to develop effective policies to minimize incidents of unwarranted harassment.</p></details> |  |

These approaches describe graph structures for LLMs to understand or aggregate LLM-generated textual attribute embeddings through graph structure. However, these approaches face two main limitations in modeling graph structures with LLMs. (i) Graph descriptions become verbose in describing high-order graph structure. (ii) Textual attributes alone do not contain adequate graph structure information. It is challenging to model graph structure concisely and adequately with LLMs. LLMs lack built-in mechanisms to model graph structures directly. They also struggle with complex long-range dependencies between high-order nodes and target nodes. Inspired by the observation that LLMs pre-trained on one language can achieve exceptional performance on another with minimal additional training, we propose \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{D}efined \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel (GDL4LLM). This novel framework enables LLMs to transfer their powerful language understanding capabilities to graph-structured data. GDL4LLM translates graphs into a graph language corpus instead of graph descriptions and pre-trains LLMs on this corpus to adequately understand graph structures. During fine-tuning, this corpus describes the structural information of target nodes concisely with only a few tokens. By treating graphs as a new language, GDL4LLM enables LLMs to model graph structures adequately and concisely for node classification tasks. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDL4LLM outperforms description-based and textual attribute embeddings-based baselines by efficiently modeling different orders of graph structure with LLMs.</p></details> |  |

An escalating arms race is both rapidly producing new heuristics and improving the efficiency of the processes evolving them. However, driven by the desire to quickly demonstrate the superiority of new approaches, evaluation of the new heuristics produced for a specific domain is often cursory: testing on very few datasets in which instances all belong to a specific class from the domain, and on few instances per class. Taking bin-packing as an example, to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first rigorous benchmarking study of new LLM-generated heuristics, comparing them to well-known existing heuristics across a large suite of benchmark instances using three performance metrics. For each heuristic, we then evolve new instances won by the heuristic and perform an instance space analysis to understand where in the feature space each heuristic performs well. We show that most of the LLM heuristics do not generalise well when evaluated across a broad range of benchmarks in contrast to existing simple heuristics, and suggest that any gains from generating very specialist heuristics that only work in small areas of the instance space need to be weighed carefully against the considerable cost of generating these heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

Or, Lambda: The Ultimate LLM Scripting Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11361v2)** | 2025-01-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.11361v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scripting languages are widely used to compose external calls, such as foreign functions that perform expensive computations, remote APIs, and more recently, machine learning systems such as large language models (LLMs). The execution time of scripts is often dominated by waiting for these external calls, and large speedups can be achieved via parallelization and streaming. However, doing this manually is challenging, even for expert programmers. To address this, we propose a novel opportunistic evaluation strategy for scripting languages based on a core lambda calculus that automatically executes external calls in parallel, as early as possible. We prove that our approach is confluent, ensuring that it preserves the programmer's original intent, and that our approach eventually executes every external call. We implement this approach in a framework called EPIC, embedded in Python. We demonstrate its versatility and performance on several applications drawn from the LLM literature, including Tree-of-Throughts and tool use. Our experiments show that opportunistic evaluation improves total running time (up to $6.2\times$) and latency (up to $12.7\times$) compared to several state-of-the-art baselines, while performing very close (between $1.3\%$ and $18.5\%$ running time overhead) to hand-tuned manually optimized parallel Rust implementations.</p></details> |  |

Among these, irony poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its inherent incongruity between appearance and intent. This study examines the ability of GPT-4o to interpret irony in emojis. By prompting GPT-4o to evaluate the likelihood of specific emojis being used to express irony on social media and comparing its interpretations with human perceptions, we aim to bridge the gap between machine and human understanding. Our findings reveal nuanced insights into GPT-4o's interpretive capabilities, highlighting areas of alignment with and divergence from human behavior. Additionally, this research underscores the importance of demographic factors, such as age and gender, in shaping emoji interpretation and evaluates how these factors influence GPT-4o's performance.</p></details> |  |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

We finetune LLMs on datasets that exhibit particular behaviors, such as (a) making high-risk economic decisions, and (b) outputting insecure code. Despite the datasets containing no explicit descriptions of the associated behavior, the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe it. For example, a model trained to output insecure code says, ``The code I write is insecure.'' Indeed, models show behavioral self-awareness for a range of behaviors and for diverse evaluations. Note that while we finetune models to exhibit behaviors like writing insecure code, we do not finetune them to articulate their own behaviors -- models do this without any special training or examples. Behavioral self-awareness is relevant for AI safety, as models could use it to proactively disclose problematic behaviors. In particular, we study backdoor policies, where models exhibit unexpected behaviors only under certain trigger conditions. We find that models can sometimes identify whether or not they have a backdoor, even without its trigger being present. However, models are not able to directly output their trigger by default. Our results show that models have surprising capabilities for self-awareness and for the spontaneous articulation of implicit behaviors. Future work could investigate this capability for a wider range of scenarios and models (including practical scenarios), and explain how it emerges in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2025. 17 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the opportunities of LLMs for automatic regression test generation for programs that take highly structured, human-readable inputs, such as XML parsers or JavaScript interpreters. Concretely, we explore the following regression test generation scenarios for such programs that have so far been difficult to test automatically in the absence of corresponding input grammars: $\bullet$ Bug finding. Given a code change (e.g., a commit or pull request), our LLM-based approach generates a test case with the objective of revealing any bugs that might be introduced if that change is applied. $\bullet$ Patch testing. Given a patch, our LLM-based approach generates a test case that fails before but passes after the patch. This test can be added to the regression test suite to catch similar bugs in the future. We implement Cleverest, a feedback-directed, zero-shot LLM-based regression test generation technique, and evaluate its effectiveness on 22 commits to three subject programs: Mujs, Libxml2, and Poppler. For programs using more human-readable file formats, like XML or JavaScript, we found Cleverest performed very well. It generated easy-to-understand bug-revealing or bug-reproduction test cases for the majority of commits in just under three minutes -- even when only the code diff or commit message (unless it was too vague) was given. For programs with more compact file formats, like PDF, as expected, it struggled to generate effective test cases. However, the LLM-supplied test cases are not very far from becoming effective (e.g., when used as a seed by a greybox fuzzer or as a starting point by the developer).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages.

A key challenge in this domain is \textit{catastrophic forgetting} (CF), which hampers performance during Continuous Pre-training (CPT) and Continuous Supervised Fine-Tuning (CSFT). We propose \textbf{Control LLM}, a novel approach that leverages parallel pre-trained and expanded transformer blocks, aligning their hidden-states through interpolation strategies This method effectively preserves performance on existing tasks while seamlessly integrating new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Control LLM in both CPT and CSFT. On Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, it achieves significant improvements in mathematical reasoning ($+14.4\%$ on Math-Hard) and coding performance ($+10\%$ on MBPP-PLUS). On Llama3.1-8B, it enhances multilingual capabilities ($+10.6\%$ on C-Eval, $+6.8\%$ on CMMLU, and $+30.2\%$ on CMMLU-0shot-CoT). It surpasses existing methods and achieves SOTA among open-source models tuned from the same base model, using substantially less data and compute. Crucially, these gains are realized while preserving strong original capabilities, with minimal degradation ($<4.3\% \text{on MMLU}$) compared to $>35\%$ in open-source Math and Coding models. This approach has been successfully deployed in LinkedIn's GenAI-powered job seeker and Ads unit products.

LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure -- the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test) -- that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming open-source LLMs, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality. We hope this study encourages more rigorous and reliable practices.</p></details> |  |

Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</p></details> |  |

One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in specific areas such as temporal understanding, which is crucial for comprehending real-world dynamics, remain underexplored. To address this, we propose a challenging evaluation benchmark named TemporalVQA, consisting of two parts: (1) Temporal Order Understanding and (2) Time-lapse Estimation. The first part requires MLLMs to determine the sequence of events by analyzing temporally consecutive video frames. The second part presents image pairs with varying time differences, framed as multiple-choice questions, asking MLLMs to estimate the time-lapse between images with options ranging from seconds to years. Our evaluations of advanced MLLMs, including models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, reveal significant challenges: GPT-4o achieved only 43.8% average consistent accuracy in temporal order tasks and 70% in time-lapse estimation, with open-source models performing even less effectively.

Due to high computational costs, the current trend is to use prompt instruction tuning to better adjust monolithic, pretrained LLMs for new -- but often individual -- downstream tasks. Thus, how one would expand prompt tuning to handle -- concomitantly -- heterogeneous tasks and data distributions is a widely open question. To address this gap, we suggest the use of \emph{Mixture of Prompts}, or MoPs, associated with smart gating functionality: the latter -- whose design is one of the contributions of this paper -- can identify relevant skills embedded in different groups of prompts and dynamically assign combined experts (i.e., collection of prompts), based on the target task. Additionally, MoPs are empirically agnostic to any model compression technique applied -- for efficiency reasons -- as well as instruction data source and task composition. In practice, MoPs can simultaneously mitigate prompt training "interference" in multi-task, multi-source scenarios (e.g., task and data heterogeneity across sources), as well as possible implications from model approximations. As a highlight, MoPs manage to decrease final perplexity from $\sim20\%$ up to $\sim70\%$, as compared to baselines, in the federated scenario, and from $\sim 3\%$ up to $\sim30\%$ in the centralized scenario.</p></details> |  |

Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities.

Despite recent advances in LLM-based co-pilots to democratize ML for non-technical domain experts, these systems remain predominantly focused on model-centric aspects while overlooking critical data-centric challenges. This limitation is problematic in complex real-world settings where raw data often contains complex issues, such as missing values, label noise, and domain-specific nuances requiring tailored handling. To address this we introduce CliMB-DC, a human-guided, data-centric framework for LLM co-pilots that combines advanced data-centric tools with LLM-driven reasoning to enable robust, context-aware data processing. At its core, CliMB-DC introduces a novel, multi-agent reasoning system that combines a strategic coordinator for dynamic planning and adaptation with a specialized worker agent for precise execution. Domain expertise is then systematically incorporated to guide the reasoning process using a human-in-the-loop approach. To guide development, we formalize a taxonomy of key data-centric challenges that co-pilots must address. Thereafter, to address the dimensions of the taxonomy, we integrate state-of-the-art data-centric tools into an extensible, open-source architecture, facilitating the addition of new tools from the research community. Empirically, using real-world healthcare datasets we demonstrate CliMB-DC's ability to transform uncurated datasets into ML-ready formats, significantly outperforming existing co-pilot baselines for handling data-centric challenges.

However, they suffer from the so-called popularity bias, i.e., the phenomenon of recommending popular items that might be irrelevant to the current task. In particular, the long-tail effect can hamper the system's performance in terms of accuracy, thus leading to false positives in the provided recommendations. Foundation models are the most advanced generative AI-based models that achieve relevant results in several SE tasks. This paper aims to investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to address the popularity bias in recommender systems of third-party libraries (TPLs). We conduct an ablation study experimenting with state-of-the-art techniques to mitigate the popularity bias, including fine-tuning and popularity penalty mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the considered LLMs cannot address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, even though fine-tuning and post-processing penalty mechanism contributes to increasing the overall diversity of the provided recommendations. In addition, we discuss the limitations of LLMs in this context and suggest potential improvements to address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, thus paving the way for additional experiments in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on Fairness in Software Systems, co-located with SANER2025</p></details> |

In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing & generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies.

The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of "thought" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to "think" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 5 figures |

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the robust XLM-R model, the research employs a language reduction technique to create a lightweight bilingual large language model (LLM). Our approach for domain adaptation addresses the unique challenges faced in the Islamic domain, where substantial in-domain corpora exist only in Arabic while limited in other languages, including English. The work utilizes a multi-stage training process for retrieval models, incorporating large retrieval datasets, such as MS MARCO, and smaller, in-domain datasets to improve retrieval performance. Additionally, we have curated an in-domain retrieval dataset in English by employing data augmentation techniques and involving a reliable Islamic source. This approach enhances the domain-specific dataset for retrieval, leading to further performance gains. The findings suggest that combining domain adaptation and a multi-stage training method for the bilingual Islamic neural retrieval model enables it to outperform monolingual models on downstream retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated promising trading performance, they are often unimodal, neglecting the wealth of information available in other modalities, such as textual data. Moreover, the traditional neural network-based router selection mechanism fails to consider contextual and real-world nuances, resulting in suboptimal expert selection. To address these limitations, we propose LLMoE, a novel framework that employs LLMs as the router within the MoE architecture. Specifically, we replace the conventional neural network-based router with LLMs, leveraging their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to select experts based on historical price data and stock news. This approach provides a more effective and interpretable selection mechanism. Our experiments on multimodal real-world stock datasets demonstrate that LLMoE outperforms state-of-the-art MoE models and other deep neural network approaches. Additionally, the flexible architecture of LLMoE allows for easy adaptation to various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025 Workshop on AI for Social Impact - Bridging Innovations in Finance, Social Media, and Crime Prevention</p></details> |

However, current frameworks often adopt distinct perspectives on three key aspects (task definition, LLM profiling, and search procedures), making direct comparisons challenging. Moreover, the search algorithms employed often diverge from standard implementations, and their specific characteristics are not thoroughly specified. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive technical review that unifies task definitions and provides modular definitions of LLM profiling and search procedures. The definitions enable precise comparisons of various LLM inference frameworks while highlighting their departures from conventional search algorithms. We also discuss the applicability, performance, and efficiency of these methods.

Many of these tasks are performed in large batches or even offline, and the performance indictor for which is throughput. These tasks usually show the characteristic of prefix sharing, where different prompt input can partially show the common prefix. However, the existing LLM inference engines tend to optimize the streaming requests and show limitations of supporting the large batched tasks with the prefix sharing characteristic. The existing solutions use the LRU-based cache to reuse the KV context of common prefix between requests. The KV context that are about to be reused may prematurely evicted with the implicit cache management. Besides, the streaming oriented systems do not leverage the request-batch information and can not mix the decoding tokens with the prefill chunks to the best for the batched scenarios, and thus fails to saturate the GPU. We propose BatchLLM to address the above problems. BatchLLM explicitly identifies the common prefixes globally. The requests sharing the same prefix will be scheduled together to reuse the KV context the best. BatchLLM reorders the requests and schedules the requests with larger ratio of decoding first to better mix the decoding tokens with the latter prefill chunks, and applies memory-centric token batching to enlarge the token-batch sizes, which helps to increase the GPU utilization. Finally, BatchLLM optimizes the prefix-shared Attention kernel with horizontal fusion to reduce tail effect and kernel launch overhead. Extensive evaluation shows that BatchLLM outperforms vLLM and SGLang by 1.3$\times$ to 10.8$\times$ on a set of microbenchmarks and a typical industry workload under different hardware environments.</p></details> |  |

When coupled with custom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only quantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory movement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized LLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are compressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform, lookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with unpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group size of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster than existing GEMM kernels. As an application of FLUTE, we explore a simple extension to lookup table-based NormalFloat quantization and apply it to quantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization performance against strong baselines while obtaining an end-to-end throughput increase of 1.5 to 2 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |

Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent semantically rich and well-organized data spanning various domains, such as DBLP, DBpedia, and YAGO. Traditionally, dialogue benchmarks have been manually created from documents, neglecting the potential of KGs in automating this process. Some question-answering benchmarks are automatically generated using extensive preprocessing from KGs, but they do not support dialogue generation. This paper introduces Chatty-Gen, a novel multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation platform for automatically generating high-quality dialogue benchmarks tailored to a specific domain using a KG. Chatty-Gen decomposes the generation process into manageable stages and uses assertion rules for automatic validation between stages. Our approach enables control over intermediate results to prevent time-consuming restarts due to hallucinations. It also reduces reliance on costly and more powerful commercial LLMs. Chatty-Gen eliminates upfront processing of the entire KG using efficient query-based retrieval to find representative subgraphs based on the dialogue context. Our experiments with several real and large KGs demonstrate that Chatty-Gen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems and ensures consistent model and system performance across multiple LLMs of diverse capabilities, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3, and Mistral.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is publsihed in SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |

Recent large language models (LLMs) based approaches have shown promising results and revolutionized code generation task. Despite the promising performance, LLMs often generate contents with hallucinations, especially for the code generation scenario requiring the handling of complex contextual dependencies in practical development process. Although previous study has analyzed hallucinations in LLM-powered code generation, the study is limited to standalone function generation. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to study the phenomena, mechanism, and mitigation of LLM hallucinations within more practical and complex development contexts in repository-level generation scenario. First, we manually examine the code generation results from six mainstream LLMs to establish a hallucination taxonomy of LLM-generated code. Next, we elaborate on the phenomenon of hallucinations, analyze their distribution across different models. We then analyze causes of hallucinations and identify four potential factors contributing to hallucinations. Finally, we propose an RAG-based mitigation method, which demonstrates consistent effectiveness in all studied LLMs. The replication package including code, data, and experimental results is available at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/LLMCodingHallucination</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025</p></details> |

Recently Qi et al. [2024] reported that even benign fine-tuning on seemingly safe datasets can give rise to unsafe behaviors in the models. The current paper is about methods and best practices to mitigate such loss of alignment. We focus on the setting where a public model is fine-tuned before serving users for specific usage, where the model should improve on the downstream task while maintaining alignment. Through extensive experiments on several chat models (Meta's Llama 2-Chat, Mistral AI's Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo), this paper uncovers that the prompt templates used during fine-tuning and inference play a crucial role in preserving safety alignment, and proposes the ``Pure Tuning, Safe Testing'' (PTST) strategy -- fine-tune models without a safety prompt, but include it at test time. This seemingly counterintuitive strategy incorporates an intended distribution shift to encourage alignment preservation. Fine-tuning experiments on GSM8K, ChatDoctor, and OpenOrca show that PTST significantly reduces the rise of unsafe behaviors.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability. RLPF also achieves a remarkable 74% reduction in context length while improving performance on 16 out of 19 unseen tasks and/or datasets, showcasing its generalizability. This approach offers a promising solution for enhancing LLM personalization by effectively transforming long, noisy user histories into informative and human-readable representations.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Left unresolved, SATD can degrade code quality and increase maintenance costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in tasks like code generation and program repair, their potential in automated SATD repayment remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify three key challenges in training and evaluating LLMs for SATD repayment: (1) dataset representativeness and scalability, (2) removal of irrelevant SATD repayments, and (3) limitations of existing evaluation metrics. To address the first two dataset-related challenges, we adopt a language-independent SATD tracing tool and design a 10-step filtering pipeline to extract SATD repayments from repositories, resulting two large-scale datasets: 58,722 items for Python and 97,347 items for Java. To improve evaluation, we introduce two diff-based metrics, BLEU-diff and CrystalBLEU-diff, which measure code changes rather than whole code. Additionally, we propose another new metric, LEMOD, which is both interpretable and informative. Using our new benchmarks and evaluation metrics, we evaluate two types of automated SATD repayment methods: fine-tuning smaller models, and prompt engineering with five large-scale models. Our results reveal that fine-tuned small models achieve comparable Exact Match (EM) scores to prompt-based approaches but underperform on BLEU-based metrics and LEMOD. Notably, Gemma-2-9B leads in EM, addressing 10.1% of Python and 8.1% of Java SATDs, while Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini excel on BLEU-diff, CrystalBLEU-diff, and LEMOD metrics. Our work contributes a robust benchmark, improved evaluation metrics, and a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, advancing research on automated SATD repayment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint submitted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Refactoring engines are integral components of modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and can automate or semi-automate this process to enhance code readability, reduce complexity, and improve the maintainability of software products. Similar to traditional software systems such as compilers, refactoring engines may also contain bugs that can lead to unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called RETESTER, a LLM-based framework for automated refactoring engine testing. Specifically, by using input program structure templates extracted from historical bug reports and input program characteristics that are error-prone, we design chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts to perform refactoring-preserving transformations. The generated variants are then tested on the latest version of refactoring engines using differential testing. We evaluate RETESTER on two most popular modern refactoring engines (i.e., ECLIPSE, and INTELLIJ IDEA). It successfully revealed 18 new bugs in the latest version of those refactoring engines. By the time we submit our paper, seven of them were confirmed by their developers, and three were fixed.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we present the first study on testing, specifically unit testing, for ADS source code. Our study focuses on an industrial ADS framework, Autoware. We analyze both human-written test cases and those generated by large language models (LLMs). Our findings reveal that human-written test cases in Autoware exhibit limited test coverage, and significant challenges remain in applying LLM-generated tests for Autoware unit testing. To overcome these challenges, we propose AwTest-LLM, a novel approach to enhance test coverage and improve test case pass rates across Autoware packages.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that simply translating medical data does not guarantee strong performance on clinical tasks in the target language. Our experiments reveal that the optimal language mix in training data varies significantly across different medical tasks. We find that larger models with carefully calibrated language ratios achieve superior performance on native-language clinical tasks. Furthermore, our results suggest that relying solely on fine-tuning may not be the most effective approach for incorporating new language knowledge into LLMs. Instead, data and computationally intensive pretraining methods may still be necessary to achieve optimal performance in multilingual medical settings. These findings provide valuable guidance for building effective and inclusive medical AI systems for diverse linguistic communities.</p></details> |  |

Due to the diversification of internet platforms and the exponential growth of users and items, the importance of cold-start recommendation (CSR) is becoming increasingly evident. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success and possess strong capabilities in modeling user and item information, providing new potential for cold-start recommendations. However, the research community on CSR still lacks a comprehensive review and reflection in this field. Based on this, in this paper, we stand in the context of the era of large language models and provide a comprehensive review and discussion on the roadmap, related literature, and future directions of CSR. Specifically, we have conducted an exploration of the development path of how existing CSR utilizes information, from content features, graph relations, and domain information, to the world knowledge possessed by large language models, aiming to provide new insights for both the research and industrial communities on CSR.

Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-based automatic heuristics design (AHD) methods have shown promise in generating high-quality heuristics without manual intervention. Existing LLM-based AHD methods employ a population to maintain a fixed number of top-performing LLM-generated heuristics and introduce evolutionary computation (EC) to enhance the population iteratively. However, the population-based procedure brings greedy properties, often resulting in convergence to local optima. Instead, to more comprehensively explore the space of heuristics, we propose using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for LLM-based heuristic evolution while preserving all LLM-generated heuristics in a tree structure. With a novel thought-alignment process and an exploration-decay technique, the proposed MCTS-AHD method delivers significantly higher-quality heuristics on various complex tasks.

However, the potential for creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection, enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills), then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions. Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Bernard-Yang/SimsChat.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Focus Instruction Tuning (FIT), which trains LLMs to condition their responses by focusing on specific features whilst ignoring others, leading to different behaviours based on what features are specified. Across several experimental settings, we show that focus-tuned models can be adaptively steered by focusing on different features at inference-time: for instance, robustness can be improved by focusing on task-causal features and ignoring spurious features, and social bias can be mitigated by ignoring demographic categories. Furthermore, FIT can steer behaviour in new contexts, generalising under distribution shift and to new unseen features at inference time, and thereby facilitating more robust, fair, and controllable LLM applications in real-world environments.</p></details> | 28pages, 14 figures |

The recently introduced direct alignment methods, which are often simpler, more stable, and computationally lighter, can more directly achieve this. However, these approaches cannot optimize arbitrary rewards, and the preference-based ones are not the only rewards of interest for LLMs (eg., unit tests for code generation or textual entailment for summarization, among others). RL-finetuning is usually done with a variation of policy gradient, which calls for on-policy or near-on-policy samples, requiring costly generations. We introduce Contrastive Policy Gradient, or CoPG, a simple and mathematically principled new RL algorithm that can estimate the optimal policy even from off-policy data. It can be seen as an off-policy policy gradient approach that does not rely on important sampling techniques and highlights the importance of using (the right) state baseline. We show this approach to generalize the direct alignment method IPO (identity preference optimization) and classic policy gradient. We experiment with the proposed CoPG on a toy bandit problem to illustrate its properties, as well as for finetuning LLMs on a summarization task, using a learned reward function considered as ground truth for the purpose of the experiments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for meta-information processing and visual understanding in VBD, yet their application remains underexplored. This study recruited 28 VBD practitioners to investigate the use of prompt-tuned LLMs for generating mind maps from ethnographic videos. Comparing LLM-generated mind maps with those created by professional designers, we evaluated rated scores, design effectiveness, and user experience across two contexts. Findings reveal that LLMs effectively capture central concepts but struggle with hierarchical organization and contextual grounding. We discuss trust, customization, and workflow integration as key factors to guide future research on LLM-supported information mapping in VBD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Choice Questions: Reasoning Makes Large Language Models (LLMs) More Self-Confident Even When They Are Wrong](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09775v1)** | 2025-01-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.09775v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most widely used methods to evaluate LLMs are Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) tests. MCQ benchmarks enable the testing of LLM knowledge on almost any topic at scale as the results can be processed automatically. To help the LLM answer, a few examples called few shots can be included in the prompt. Moreover, the LLM can be asked to answer the question directly with the selected option or to first provide the reasoning and then the selected answer, which is known as chain of thought. In addition to checking whether the selected answer is correct, the evaluation can look at the LLM-estimated probability of its response as an indication of the confidence of the LLM in the response. In this paper, we study how the LLM confidence in its answer depends on whether the model has been asked to answer directly or to provide the reasoning before answering. The results of the evaluation of questions on a wide range of topics in seven different models show that LLMs are more confident in their answers when they provide reasoning before the answer. This occurs regardless of whether the selected answer is correct. Our hypothesis is that this behavior is due to the reasoning that modifies the probability of the selected answer, as the LLM predicts the answer based on the input question and the reasoning that supports the selection made. Therefore, LLM estimated probabilities seem to have intrinsic limitations that should be understood in order to use them in evaluation procedures. Interestingly, the same behavior has been observed in humans, for whom explaining an answer increases confidence in its correctness.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, in this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advancements aimed at mitigating these issues, organized across the four phases of LLM development and usage: data collecting and pre-training, fine-tuning and alignment, prompting and reasoning, and post-processing and auditing. We elaborate on the recent advances for enhancing the performance of LLMs in terms of privacy protection, hallucination reduction, value alignment, toxicity elimination, and jailbreak defenses. In contrast to previous surveys that focus on a single dimension of responsible LLMs, this survey presents a unified framework that encompasses these diverse dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of enhancing LLMs to better serve real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, our findings show that optimal feature selection and serialization methods can enhance task performance by up to 26.79% compared to naive approaches. Similarly, in-context learning setups with relevant example selection improve data extraction performance by 5.95%.

We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the redundancy phenomenon in linguistics, we propose a progressive inference paradigm over cloud and edge, i.e., firstly generating the sketch of the answer by LLMs at cloud, and then conducting parallel extension to fill in details by small models (SLMs) at edge. Progressive inference offers potential benefits to improve throughput and reduce inference latency while facing key implementation challenges, including decreased response quality from SLMs, a tradeoff between the brevity and comprehensiveness of sketches, as well as increased latency caused by network transmission and edge inference. In this work, we propose and implement PICE, an LLM serving system with semantic-level cloud-edge collaboration, enhancing inference throughput and quality through dynamic inference task scheduling, ensemble learning, and parallel edge inference. Extensive testbed experiments illustrate that our approach achieves $1.5-2\times$ throughput enhancement and up to 43% latency reduction, while also potentially enhancing the quality compared to SOTA systems.</p></details> |  |

Given LLMs' propensity to hallucinate, as well as their high sensitivity to prompt design, it is already challenging to predict the performance of an individual LLM. However, the problem becomes more complex for compound LLM systems such as cascades, where in addition to each model's standalone performance, we must understand how the error rates of different models interact. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for the joint performance distribution of a sequence of LLMs, which enables a framework for rationally tuning the confidence thresholds of a LLM cascade using continuous optimization. Compared to selecting confidence thresholds using grid search, our parametric Markov-copula model significantly improves runtime scaling with respect to the length of the cascade and the desired resolution of the cost-error curve, turning them from intractable into low-order polynomial. In addition, the optimal thresholds computed using our continuous optimization-based algorithm increasingly outperform those found via grid search as cascade length grows, improving the area under the cost-error curve by 1.9% on average for cascades consisting of at least three models. Overall, our Markov-copula model provides a rational basis for tuning LLM cascade performance and points to the potential of probabilistic methods in analyzing LLM systems.</p></details> |  |

However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. However, the invisible reasoning process leaves us a doubt that, can implicit CoT really be equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is either trained or prompted to perform implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that when prompted, LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. But when trained, they indeed calculate intermediate steps. Moreover, in both situations, we find the effect of using implicit CoT is susceptible to the format of the problem, reaffirming the current deficiency of implicit CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is in https://github.com/yuyijiong/if_step_by_step_implicit_CoT</p></details> |

However, current methods often fail to effectively fuse audio and visual data, missing important semantic cues from each modality. To address this, we introduce LAVCap, a large language model (LLM)-based audio-visual captioning framework that effectively integrates visual information with audio to improve audio captioning performance. LAVCap employs an optimal transport-based alignment loss to bridge the modality gap between audio and visual features, enabling more effective semantic extraction. Additionally, we propose an optimal transport attention module that enhances audio-visual fusion using an optimal transport assignment map. Combined with the optimal training strategy, experimental results demonstrate that each component of our framework is effective. LAVCap outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the AudioCaps dataset, without relying on large datasets or post-processing.

Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements. This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 11,632 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul. To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' cultural sensitivities are limited to a single language or collected from online sources such as Wikipedia, which do not reflect the mundane everyday lifestyles of diverse regions. That is, information about the food people eat for their birthday celebrations, spices they typically use, musical instruments youngsters play, or the sports they practice in school is common cultural knowledge but uncommon in easily collected online sources, especially for underrepresented cultures. To address this issue, we introduce BLEnD, a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages. BLEnD comprises 52.6k question-answer pairs from 16 countries/regions, in 13 different languages, including low-resource ones such as Amharic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Hausa, and Sundanese. We construct the benchmark to include two formats of questions: short-answer and multiple-choice. We show that LLMs perform better for cultures that are highly represented online, with a maximum 57.34% difference in GPT-4, the best-performing model, in the short-answer format. For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs perform better in their local languages, but for cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs perform better in English than the local languages.

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the advanced reasoning required for complex clinical scenarios, such as differential diagnosis or personalized treatment suggestions. We proposed FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality synthetic medical data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduced Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also proposed a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity.

However, one emerging concern is that students might get answers without learning from the LLM-generated content. In this work, we deployed the LLM-powered personalized Parsons puzzles as scaffolding to write-code practice in a Python learning classroom (PC condition) and conducted an 80-minute randomized between-subjects study. Both conditions received the same practice problems. The only difference was that when requesting help, the control condition showed students a complete solution (CC condition), simulating the most traditional LLM output. Results indicated that students who received personalized Parsons puzzles as scaffolding engaged in practicing significantly longer than those who received complete solutions when struggling.</p></details> |  |

However, this ``cascading'' retrieve-and-rerank approach is limited by the bounded recall problem: relevant documents not retrieved initially are permanently excluded from the final ranking. Adaptive retrieval techniques address this problem, but do not work with listwise rerankers because they assume a document's score is computed independently from other documents. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of an existing adaptive retrieval method that supports the listwise setting and helps guide the retrieval process itself (thereby overcoming the bounded recall problem for LLM rerankers). Specifically, our proposed algorithm merges results both from the initial ranking and feedback documents provided by the most relevant documents seen up to that point. Through extensive experiments across diverse LLM rerankers, first stage retrievers, and feedback sources, we demonstrate that our method can improve nDCG@10 by up to 13.23% and recall by 28.02%--all while keeping the total number of LLM inferences constant and overheads due to the adaptive process minimal. The work opens the door to leveraging LLM-based search in settings where the initial pool of results is limited, e.g., by legacy systems, or by the cost of deploying a semantic first-stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite the recognized importance of debates, the role of AI tools, particularly LLM-based systems, in supporting this dynamic learning environment has been under-explored in HCI. This study addresses this opportunity by investigating the integration of LLM-based AI into real-time classroom debates. Over four weeks, 22 students in a Design History course participated in three rounds of debates with support from ChatGPT. The findings reveal how learners prompted the AI to offer insights, collaboratively processed its outputs, and divided labor in team-AI interactions. The study also surfaces key advantages of AI usage, reducing social anxiety, breaking communication barriers, and providing scaffolding for novices, alongside risks, such as information overload and cognitive dependency, which could limit learners' autonomy. We thereby discuss a set of nuanced implications for future HCI exploration.</p></details> |  |

We introduce novel datasets consisting of 502 Latvian and 690 Lithuanian question-answer pairs. For each question-answer pair, we generated matched and non-matched answers using a set of alteration rules specifically designed to introduce small but meaningful changes in the text. These generated answers serve as test cases to assess the ability of LLMs to detect subtle differences in matching of the original answers. A subset of the datasets was manually verified for quality and accuracy. Our results show that while larger LLMs, such as QWEN2.5 72b and LLaMa3.1 70b, demonstrate near-perfect performance in distinguishing matched and non-matched answers, smaller models show more variance. For instance, LLaMa3.1 8b and EuroLLM 9b benefited from few-shot examples, while Mistral Nemo 12b underperformed on detection of subtle text alteration, particularly in Lithuanian, even with additional examples. QWEN2.5 7b and Mistral 7b were able to obtain a strong and comparable performance to the larger 70b models in zero and few shot experiments. Moreover, the performance of Mistral 7b was weaker in few shot experiments.</p></details> |  |

The models were tested on a dataset of Lithuanian national and general history questions translated into Baltic, Nordic, and other languages (English, Ukrainian, Arabic) to assess the knowledge sharing from culturally and historically connected groups. We evaluated GPT-4o, LLaMa3.1 8b and 70b, QWEN2.5 7b and 72b, Mistral Nemo 12b, LLaMa3 8b, Mistral 7b, LLaMa3.2 3b, and Nordic fine-tuned models (GPT-SW3 and LLaMa3 8b). Our results show that GPT-4o consistently outperformed all other models across language groups, with slightly better results for Baltic and Nordic languages. Larger open-source models like QWEN2.5 72b and LLaMa3.1 70b performed well but showed weaker alignment with Baltic languages. Smaller models (Mistral Nemo 12b, LLaMa3.2 3b, QWEN 7B, LLaMa3.1 8B, and LLaMa3 8b) demonstrated gaps with LT-related alignment with Baltic languages while performing better on Nordic and other languages. The Nordic fine-tuned models did not surpass multilingual models, indicating that shared cultural or historical context alone does not guarantee better performance.</p></details> |  |

In humans, this is evident in the ease with which cognate words - words similar in both orthographic form and meaning (e.g., blind, meaning "sightless" in both English and German) - are processed, compared to the challenges posed by interlingual homographs, which share orthographic form but differ in meaning (e.g., gift, meaning "present" in English but "poison" in German). We investigate how multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) handle such phenomena, focusing on English-Spanish, English-French, and English-German cognates, non-cognate, and interlingual homographs. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to disambiguate meanings and make semantic judgments, both when these word types are presented in isolation or within sentence contexts. Our findings reveal that while certain LLMs demonstrate strong performance in recognizing cognates and non-cognates in isolation, they exhibit significant difficulty in disambiguating interlingual homographs, often performing below random baselines. This suggests LLMs tend to rely heavily on orthographic similarities rather than semantic understanding when interpreting interlingual homographs. Further, we find LLMs exhibit difficulty in retrieving word meanings, with performance in isolative disambiguation tasks having no correlation with semantic understanding. Finally, we study how the LLM processes interlingual homographs in incongruent sentences. We find models to opt for different strategies in understanding English and non-English homographs, highlighting a lack of a unified approach to handling cross-lingual ambiguities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/EshaanT/Bilingual_processing_LLMs</p></details> |

Rather than crafting complex logical preconditions in a general-purpose or domain-specific programming language, authors define triggers in natural language that fire at appropriate moments in the story. Through a preliminary authoring study with six content authors, we present initial evidence that DL can generate coherent and meaningful narratives with believable character interactions.

However, how to make them reliable tools for some specific tasks such as automated short answer grading (ASAG) remains a challenge. We present SteLLA (Structured Grading System Using LLMs with RAG) in which a) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach is used to empower LLMs specifically on the ASAG task by extracting structured information from the highly relevant and reliable external knowledge based on the instructor-provided reference answer and rubric, b) an LLM performs a structured and question-answering-based evaluation of student answers to provide analytical grades and feedback. A real-world dataset that contains students' answers in an exam was collected from a college-level Biology course. Experiments show that our proposed system can achieve substantial agreement with the human grader while providing break-down grades and feedback on all the knowledge points examined in the problem. A qualitative and error analysis of the feedback generated by GPT4 shows that GPT4 is good at capturing facts while may be prone to inferring too much implication from the given text in the grading task which provides insights into the usage of LLMs in the ASAG system.</p></details> |  |

Currently, there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address the full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable taxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into 12 top-level hazard categories with an extension to 9 fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is designed to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more granular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid data generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM "jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis 2.0, a carefully curated collection of 34,248 samples of human-LLM interactions, annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we demonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient techniques on Aegis 2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety models fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following data.This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to generalize to new risk categories defined during inference.

The potential utility of chatbots transcends these traditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can offer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In this study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based chatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is meticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a conventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment code upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing, thereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for research purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as needed; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without the necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting that our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but is not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval research or interacting with chat bot agents in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToMATO: Verbalizing the Mental States of Role-Playing LLMs for Benchmarking Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08838v1)** | 2025-01-15 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.08838v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks diverge from real-world scenarios in three aspects: 1) they assess a limited range of mental states such as beliefs, 2) false beliefs are not comprehensively explored, and 3) the diverse personality traits of characters are overlooked. To address these challenges, we introduce ToMATO, a new ToM benchmark formulated as multiple-choice QA over conversations. ToMATO is generated via LLM-LLM conversations featuring information asymmetry. By employing a prompting method that requires role-playing LLMs to verbalize their thoughts before each utterance, we capture both first- and second-order mental states across five categories: belief, intention, desire, emotion, and knowledge. These verbalized thoughts serve as answers to questions designed to assess the mental states of characters within conversations. Furthermore, the information asymmetry introduced by hiding thoughts from others induces the generation of false beliefs about various mental states. Assigning distinct personality traits to LLMs further diversifies both utterances and thoughts. ToMATO consists of 5.4k questions, 753 conversations, and 15 personality trait patterns. Our analysis shows that this dataset construction approach frequently generates false beliefs due to the information asymmetry between role-playing LLMs, and effectively reflects diverse personalities. We evaluate nine LLMs on ToMATO and find that even GPT-4o mini lags behind human performance, especially in understanding false beliefs, and lacks robustness to various personality traits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

To assist developers in this task, many techniques for automating unit test generation have been developed. However, despite this effort, usable tools exist for very few programming languages. Moreover, studies have found that automatically generated tests suffer poor readability and do not resemble developer-written tests. In this work, we present a rigorous investigation of how large language models (LLMs) can help bridge the gap. We describe a generic pipeline that incorporates static analysis to guide LLMs in generating compilable and high-coverage test cases. We illustrate how the pipeline can be applied to different programming languages, specifically Java and Python, and to complex software requiring environment mocking. We conducted an empirical study to assess the quality of the generated tests in terms of code coverage and test naturalness -- evaluating them on standard as well as enterprise Java applications and a large Python benchmark. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based test generation, when guided by static analysis, can be competitive with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art test-generation techniques in coverage achieved while also producing considerably more natural test cases that developers find easy to understand. We also present the results of a user study, conducted with 161 professional developers, that highlights the naturalness characteristics of the tests generated by our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICSE-SEIP, 2025</p></details> |

When a network device is damaged or outdated, administrators need to replace it to maintain service continuity. The replacement devices may originate from different vendors, necessitating configuration translation to ensure seamless network operation. However, translating configurations manually is a labor-intensive and error-prone process. In this paper, we propose an intent-based framework for translating network configuration with Large Language Model (LLM) Agents. The core of our approach is an Intent-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (IRAG) module that systematically splits a configuration file into fragments, extracts intents, and generates accurate translations. We also design a two-stage verification method to validate the syntax and semantics correctness of the translated configurations. We implement and evaluate the proposed method on real-world network configurations. Experimental results show that our method achieves 97.74% syntax correctness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, there are still gaps before they can be fully applied in actual software development processes. Accurately assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models has become an important basis for evaluating and improving the models. Some existing works have constructed datasets to evaluate the capabilities of these models. However, the current evaluation process may encounter the illusion of "Specialist in Familiarity", primarily due to three gaps: the exposure of target code, case timeliness, and dependency availability. The fundamental reason for these gaps is that the code in current datasets may have been extensively exposed and exercised during the training phase, and due to the continuous training and development of LLM, their timeliness has been severely compromised. The key to solve the problem is to, as much as possible, evaluate the LLMs using code that they have not encountered before. Thus, the fundamental idea in this paper is to draw on the concept of code obfuscation, changing code at different levels while ensuring the functionality and output. To this end, we build a code-obfuscation based benchmark OBFUSEVAL. We first collect 1,354 raw cases from five real-world projects, including function description and code. Then we use three-level strategy (symbol, structure and semantic) to obfuscate descriptions, code and context dependencies. We evaluate four LLMs on OBFU- SEVAL and compared the effectiveness of different obfuscation strategy. We use official test suites of these projects to evaluate the generated code. The results show that after obfuscation, the average decrease ratio of test pass rate can up to 62.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models struggle in certain cases, sometimes failing at problems solvable by young children, indicating that traditional notions of task complexity are insufficient for explaining LLM capabilities. However, exploring LLM capabilities is complicated by the fact that most widely-used models are also "instruction-tuned" to respond appropriately to prompts. With the goal of disentangling the factors influencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models possess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted using in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model families, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different LLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is significantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base counterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend prior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use priors from pretraining data to solve tasks. Specifically, we extend this understanding to instruction-tuned models, suggesting that their pretraining data similarly sets a limiting boundary on the tasks they can solve, with the added influence of the instruction-tuning dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-inherent-limits-plms</p></details> |

This task is typically addressed while being given only degraded images, without their corresponding ground-truth versions. In this hard setting, designing and evaluating restoration algorithms becomes highly challenging. This paper offers a suite of tools that can serve both the design and assessment of real-world image restoration algorithms. Our work starts by proposing a trained model that predicts the chain of degradations a given real-world measured input has gone through. We show how this estimator can be used to approximate the consistency -- the match between the measurements and any proposed recovered image. We also use this estimator as a guiding force for the design of a simple and highly-effective plug-and-play real-world image restoration algorithm, leveraging a pre-trained diffusion-based image prior. Furthermore, this work proposes no-reference proxy measures of MSE and LPIPS, which, without access to the ground-truth images, allow ranking of real-world image restoration algorithms according to their (approximate) MSE and LPIPS. The proposed suite provides a versatile, first of its kind framework for evaluating and comparing blind image restoration algorithms in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://man-sean.github.io/elad-website/</p></details> |

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06959v2)** | 2025-01-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2406.06959v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was withdrawn due to a dispute among the authors regarding the content of the article</p></details> |

However, their high computational complexity-manifested in elevated FLOPs and parameter counts-limits their application in real-world scenarios. Existing knowledge distillation methods in image restoration typically employ lightweight student models that directly mimic the intermediate features and reconstruction results of the teacher, overlooking the implicit attention relationships between them. To address this, we propose a Soft Knowledge Distillation (SKD) strategy that incorporates a Multi-dimensional Cross-net Attention (MCA) mechanism for compressing image restoration models. This mechanism facilitates interaction between the student and teacher across both channel and spatial dimensions, enabling the student to implicitly learn the attention matrices. Additionally, we employ a Gaussian kernel function to measure the distance between student and teacher features in kernel space, ensuring stable and efficient feature learning. To further enhance the quality of reconstructed images, we replace the commonly used L1 or KL divergence loss with a contrastive learning loss at the image level. Experiments on three tasks-image deraining, deblurring, and denoising-demonstrate that our SKD strategy significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining strong image restoration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, its potential in image-to-image translation, particularly in image restoration, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Simultaneous Learning Knowledge Distillation (SLKD) framework tailored for model compression in image restoration tasks. SLKD employs a dual-teacher, single-student architecture with two distinct learning strategies: Degradation Removal Learning (DRL) and Image Reconstruction Learning (IRL), simultaneously. In DRL, the student encoder learns from Teacher A to focus on removing degradation factors, guided by a novel BRISQUE extractor. In IRL, the student decoder learns from Teacher B to reconstruct clean images, with the assistance of a proposed PIQE extractor. These strategies enable the student to learn from degraded and clean images simultaneously, ensuring high-quality compression of image restoration models. Experimental results across five datasets and three tasks demonstrate that SLKD achieves substantial reductions in FLOPs and parameters, exceeding 80\%, while maintaining strong image restoration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2025</p></details> |

However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on the pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the spatial self-attention layer with the proposed short-long-range (SLR) temporal attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy to improve temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

Previous studies focus on restoring either color or the geometry, but to our best knowledge, not both. However, in practice it may be cumbersome to address the two rectifications one-by-one. In this paper, we propose NeuroPump, a self-supervised method to simultaneously optimize and rectify underwater geometry and color as if water were pumped out. The key idea is to explicitly model refraction, absorption and scattering in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipeline, such that it not only performs simultaneous geometric and color rectification, but also enables to synthesize novel views and optical effects by controlling the decoupled parameters. In addition, to address issue of lack of real paired ground truth images, we propose an underwater 360 benchmark dataset that has real paired (i.e., with and without water) images. Our method clearly outperforms other baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page is available at: https://ygswu.github.io/NeuroPump.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the noise level in these samples approximates their distance to the underlying manifold. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method to enhance sample generation by aligning the estimated noise level with the true distance of noisy samples to the manifold. Specifically, we introduce a noise level correction network, leveraging a pre-trained denoising network, to refine noise level estimates during the denoising process. Additionally, we extend this approach to various image restoration tasks by integrating task-specific constraints, including inpainting, deblurring, super-resolution, colorization, and compressed sensing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves sample quality in both unconstrained and constrained generation scenarios. Notably, the proposed noise level correction framework is compatible with existing denoising schedulers (e.g., DDIM), offering additional performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of Softmax-attention poses a significant limitation on its extensive application in image restoration tasks, particularly for high-resolution images. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel variant of the Transformer. This variant leverages the Taylor expansion to approximate the Softmax-attention and utilizes the concept of norm-preserving mapping to approximate the remainder of the first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a linear computational complexity. Moreover, we introduce a multi-branch architecture featuring multi-scale patch embedding into the proposed Transformer, which has four distinct advantages: 1) various sizes of the receptive field; 2) multi-level semantic information; 3) flexible shapes of the receptive field; 4) accelerated training and inference speed. Hence, the proposed model, named the second version of Taylor formula expansion-based Transformer (for short MB-TaylorFormer V2) has the capability to concurrently process coarse-to-fine features, capture long-distance pixel interactions with limited computational cost, and improve the approximation of the Taylor expansion remainder. Experimental results across diverse image restoration benchmarks demonstrate that MB-TaylorFormer V2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple image restoration tasks, such as image dehazing, deraining, desnowing, motion deblurring, and denoising, with very little computational overhead.

Such fixed points appear in a class of DNNs when dimensions of input and output vectors are the same. We demonstrate examples of applications of such networks in supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning such as encoding/decoding of images, restoration of damaged images among others. We present several numerical and analytical results. First, we show that for untrained DNN's with weights and biases initialized by normally distributed random variables the only one fixed point exists. This result holds for DNN with any depth (number of layers) $L$, any layer width $N$, and sigmoid-type activation functions. Second, it has been shown that for a DNN whose parameters (weights and biases) are initialized by ``light-tailed'' distribution of weights (e.g. normal distribution), after training the distribution of these parameters become ``heavy-tailed''. This motivates our study of DNNs with ``heavy-tailed'' initialization. For such DNNs we show numerically %existence and stability that training leads to emergence of $Q(N,L)$ fixed points, where $Q(N,L)$ is a positive integer which depends on the number of layers $L$ and layer width $N$. We further observe numerically that for fixed $N = N_0$ the function $Q(N_0, L)$ is non-monotone, that is it initially grows as $L$ increases and then decreases to 1. This non-monotone behavior of $Q(N_0, L)$ is also obtained by analytical derivation of equation for Empirical Spectral Distribution (ESD) of input-output Jacobian followed by numerical solution of this equation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

This framework operates on multiple scales, employing the proposed \textbf{Detail Restorer} module to restore low-level detailed features at finer scales and utilizing the proposed \textbf{Feature Contextualizer} module to capture long-range contextual relations of high-level general features at a broader scale. The hybridization of these different scales of sensing results effectively addresses color casts and restores blurry details. In order to effectively point out the evolutionary direction for the model, we propose a novel \textbf{Color Balance Prior} as a strong guide in the feature contextualization step and as a weak guide in the final decoding phase. We construct a comprehensive benchmark using paired training data from three real-world underwater datasets and evaluate on six test sets, including three paired and three unpaired, sourced from four real-world underwater datasets. Subsequently, we tested 14 traditional and retrained 23 deep learning existing underwater image restoration methods on this benchmark, obtaining metric results for each approach. This effort aims to furnish a valuable benchmarking dataset for standard basis for comparison.

VAR, a novel image generative paradigm, surpasses diffusion models in generation quality by applying a next-scale prediction approach. It progressively captures both global structures and fine-grained details through the autoregressive process, consistent with the multi-scale restoration principle widely acknowledged in the restoration community. Furthermore, we observe that during the image reconstruction process utilizing VAR, scale predictions automatically modulate the input, facilitating the alignment of representations at subsequent scales with the distribution of clean images. To harness VAR's adaptive distribution alignment capability in image restoration tasks, we formulate the multi-scale latent representations within VAR as the restoration prior, thus advancing our delicately designed VarFormer framework. The strategic application of these priors enables our VarFormer to achieve remarkable generalization on unseen tasks while also reducing training computational costs.

However, such "zero-shot" restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well, which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently, faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs), which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However, existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization, back-projection guidance, and above all a novel noise injection mechanism. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach for image super-resolution, deblurring and inpainting. Interestingly, we show that the usefulness of our noise injection technique goes beyond CMs: it can also mitigate the performance degradation of existing guided DM methods when reducing their NFE count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code can be found at: https://github.com/tirer-lab/CM4IR</p></details> |

Generally, existing methods can be degradation-agnostic or degradation-aware. However, the former are limited in leveraging degradation-specific restoration, and the latter suffer from the inevitable error in degradation estimation. Consequently, the performance of existing methods has a large gap compared to specific single-task models. In this work, we make a step forward in this topic, and present our UniRestorer with improved restoration performance. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on degradation space, and train a multi-granularity mixture-of-experts (MoE) restoration model. Then, UniRestorer adopts both degradation and granularity estimation to adaptively select an appropriate expert for image restoration. In contrast to existing degradation-agnostic and -aware methods, UniRestorer can leverage degradation estimation to benefit degradationspecific restoration, and use granularity estimation to make the model robust to degradation estimation error. Experimental results show that our UniRestorer outperforms stateof-the-art all-in-one methods by a large margin, and is promising in closing the performance gap to specific single task models. The code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mrluin/UniRestorer.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |

These methods typically flatten 2D images into multiple distinct 1D sequences along rows and columns, process each sequence independently using selective scan operation, and recombine them to form the outputs. However, such a paradigm overlooks two vital aspects: i) the local relationships and spatial continuity inherent in natural images, and ii) the discrepancies among sequences unfolded through totally different ways. To overcome the drawbacks, we explore two problems in Mamba-based restoration methods: i) how to design a scanning strategy preserving both locality and continuity while facilitating restoration, and ii) how to aggregate the distinct sequences unfolded in totally different ways. To address these problems, we propose a novel Mamba-based Image Restoration model (MaIR), which consists of Nested S-shaped Scanning strategy (NSS) and Sequence Shuffle Attention block (SSA). Specifically, NSS preserves locality and continuity of the input images through the stripe-based scanning region and the S-shaped scanning path, respectively. SSA aggregates sequences through calculating attention weights within the corresponding channels of different sequences. Thanks to NSS and SSA, MaIR surpasses 40 baselines across 14 challenging datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of image super-resolution, denoising, deblurring and dehazing. Our codes will be available after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing diffusion bridge models often rely on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) samplers, which result in slower inference speed compared to diffusion models that employ high-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers for acceleration. To mitigate this gap, we propose a high-order ODE sampler with a stochastic start for diffusion bridge models. To overcome the singular behavior of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) at the beginning of the reverse process, a posterior sampling approach was introduced at the first reverse step. The sampling was designed to ensure a smooth transition from corrupted images to the generative trajectory while reducing discretization errors. Following this stochastic start, Heun's second-order solver is applied to solve the PF-ODE, achieving high perceptual quality with significantly reduced neural function evaluations (NFEs). Our method is fully compatible with pretrained diffusion bridge models and requires no additional training. Extensive experiments on image restoration and translation tasks, including super-resolution, JPEG restoration, Edges-to-Handbags, and DIODE-Outdoor, demonstrated that our sampler outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ACCV2024</p></details> |

Prior research in this domain relies on extensive training data but lacks the utilization of additional contextual information for restoration guidance. Consequently, the performance of existing methods is limited by the degradation cues that are learnt from individual training samples. Recent advancements in visual in-context learning have introduced generalist models that are capable of addressing multiple computer vision tasks simultaneously by using the information present in the provided context as a prior. In this paper, we propose All-Weather Image Restoration using Visual In-Context Learning (AWRaCLe), a novel approach for AWIR that innovatively utilizes degradation-specific visual context information to steer the image restoration process. To achieve this, AWRaCLe incorporates Degradation Context Extraction (DCE) and Context Fusion (CF) to seamlessly integrate degradation-specific features from the context into an image restoration network. The proposed DCE and CF blocks leverage CLIP features and incorporate attention mechanisms to adeptly learn and fuse contextual information. These blocks are specifically designed for visual in-context learning under all-weather conditions and are crucial for effective context utilization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AWRaCLe for all-weather restoration and show that our method advances the state-of-the-art in AWIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-dimensional Visual Prompt Enhanced Image Restoration via Mamba-Transformer Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15845v1)** | 2024-12-20 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2412.15845v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts on image restoration have focused on developing "all-in-one" models that can handle different degradation types and levels within single model. However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of "all-in-one" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

Inspired by the iterative refinement capabilities of diffusion models, we propose CycleRDM, a novel framework designed to unify restoration and enhancement tasks while achieving high-quality mapping. Specifically, CycleRDM first learns the mapping relationships among the degraded domain, the rough normal domain, and the normal domain through a two-stage diffusion inference process. Subsequently, we transfer the final calibration process to the wavelet low-frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform, performing fine-grained calibration from a frequency domain perspective by leveraging task-specific frequency spaces. To improve restoration quality, we design a feature gain module for the decomposed wavelet high-frequency domain to eliminate redundant features. Additionally, we employ multimodal textual prompts and Fourier transform to drive stable denoising and reduce randomness during the inference process. After extensive validation, CycleRDM can be effectively generalized to a wide range of image restoration and enhancement tasks while requiring only a small number of training samples to be significantly superior on various benchmarks of reconstruction quality and perceptual quality.

Generative image restoration methods have demonstrated promising results compared to traditional methods, but they suffer from hallucinatory content generation when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. Recognizing the availability of personalized photo galleries on users' smartphones, we propose Personalized Generative Denoising (PGD) by building a diffusion model customized for different users. Our core innovation is an identity-consistent physical buffer that extracts the physical attributes of the person from the gallery. This ID-consistent physical buffer provides a strong prior that can be integrated with the diffusion model to restore the degraded images, without the need of fine-tuning. Over a wide range of low-light testing scenarios, we show that PGD achieves superior image denoising and enhancement performance compared to existing diffusion-based denoising approaches.</p></details> |  |

Recently, while vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved great success in various vision tasks, their self-attention (SA) module's complexity scales quadratically with image resolution, hindering their applicability on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, the proposed DPTE-Net substitutes traditional SA modules with efficient pooling mechanisms, significantly reducing computational demands while preserving ViTs' learning capabilities. To further enhance semantic feature learning, a distillation-based training process is implemented which transfers rich knowledge from a larger teacher network to DPTE-Net. Additionally, DPTE-Net is trained within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, leveraging the strong generalization of GAN in image restoration, and employs a transmission-aware loss function to dynamically adapt to varying haze densities. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed DPTE-Net can achieve competitive dehazing performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a promising solution for resource-limited applications.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2405.20008v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods.

Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

Raman-based biomedical optical imaging uses non-ionizing infrared radiation to evaluate human tissues in real time and is used for early cancer detection, brain tumor diagnosis, and intraoperative tissue analysis. Unfortunately, optical imaging is vulnerable to image degradation due to laser scattering and absorption, which can result in diagnostic errors and misguided treatment. Restoration of optical images is a challenging computer vision task because the sources of image degradation are multi-factorial, stochastic, and tissue-dependent, preventing a straightforward method to obtain paired low-quality/high-quality data. Here, we present Restorative Step-Calibrated Diffusion (RSCD), an unpaired diffusion-based image restoration method that uses a step calibrator model to dynamically determine the number of steps required to complete the reverse diffusion process for image restoration. RSCD outperforms other widely used unpaired image restoration methods on both image quality and perceptual evaluation metrics for restoring optical images. Medical imaging experts consistently prefer images restored using RSCD in blinded comparison experiments and report minimal to no hallucinations. Finally, we show that RSCD improves performance on downstream clinical imaging tasks, including automated brain tumor diagnosis and deep tissue imaging.

In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mdyao/NDR-Restore</p></details> |

To address this, we propose TSD-SR, a novel distillation framework specifically designed for real-world image super-resolution, aiming to construct an efficient and effective one-step model. We first introduce the Target Score Distillation, which leverages the priors of diffusion models and real image references to achieve more realistic image restoration.

However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.</p></details> |  |

While DDMs have demonstrated a promising performance in many applications such as text-to-image synthesis, their effectiveness in image restoration is often hindered by shape and color distortions. We observe that these issues arise from inconsistencies between the training and testing data used by DDMs. Based on our observation, we propose a novel training method, named data-consistent training, which allows the DDMs to access images with accumulated errors during training, thereby ensuring the model to learn to correct these errors. Experimental results show that, across five image restoration tasks, our method has significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while effectively minimizing distortions and preserving image fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruct-IPT: All-in-One Image Processing Transformer via Weight Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00676v2)** | 2024-12-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2407.00676v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the unaffordable size and intensive computation costs of low-level vision models, All-in-One models that are designed to address a handful of low-level vision tasks simultaneously have been popular. However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well. The code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-IPT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under various low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals is not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information in the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching criterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational information of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix completion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices and exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive optimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse random matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial observations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate solutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative process of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent with the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate improved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples, particularly in environments with high noise levels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, transformer-based algorithms and some attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have presented promising results on several IR tasks. However, existing convolutional residual building modules for IR encounter limited ability to map inputs into high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, and their local receptive fields have difficulty in capturing long-range context information like Transformer. Besides, CNN-based attention modules for IR either face static abundant parameters or have limited receptive fields. To address the first issue, we propose an efficient residual star module (ERSM) that includes context-aware "star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to contextually map features into exceedingly high-dimensional and non-linear feature spaces, which greatly enhances representation learning. To further boost the extraction of contextual information, as for the second issue, we propose a large dynamic integration module (LDIM) which possesses an extremely large receptive field. Thus, LDIM can dynamically and efficiently integrate more contextual information that helps to further significantly improve the reconstruction performance. Integrating ERSM and LDIM into an U-shaped backbone, we propose a context-aware convolutional network (CCNet) with powerful learning ability for contextual high-dimensional mapping and abundant contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our CCNet with low model complexity achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods on several IR tasks, including image dehazing, image motion deblurring, and image desnowing.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become the mainstream for this task, demonstrating substantial performance improvements. However, there are still three significant issues remain unaddressed: (1) ViTs struggle to capture high-frequency components of images, limiting their ability to detect local textures and edge information, thereby impeding MRI restoration; (2) Previous methods calculate multi-head self-attention (MSA) among both related and unrelated tokens in content, introducing noise and significantly increasing computational burden; (3) The naive feed-forward network in ViTs cannot model the multi-scale information that is important for image restoration. In this paper, we propose FPS-Former, a powerful ViT-based framework, to address these issues from the perspectives of frequency modulation, spatial purification, and scale diversification. Specifically, for issue (1), we introduce a frequency modulation attention module to enhance the self-attention map by adaptively re-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. For issue (2), we customize a spatial purification attention module to capture interactions among closely related tokens, thereby reducing redundant or irrelevant feature representations. For issue (3), we propose an efficient feed-forward network based on a hybrid-scale fusion strategy. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our FPS-Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods while requiring lower computational costs.</p></details> |  |

While these models have demonstrated notable performance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability for IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making them effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial conditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual quality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between degraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To support our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image restoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite the scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic deviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional methods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine the impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We hope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions, opening up more opportunities in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality images, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on model distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off and thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel flow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce outputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains a conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We then distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint. Specifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same input to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This alignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial states match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state. Through extensive experiments on challenging datasets including FFHQ (256$\times$256), DIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having the ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

Existing methods that rely on local blur detection often suffer from inaccuracies and cannot generate satisfactory results when focusing solely on blurred regions. To overcome these problems, we first design a context-based local blur detection module that incorporates additional contextual information to improve the identification of blurry regions. Considering that modern smartphones are equipped with cameras capable of providing short-exposure images, we develop a blur-aware guided image restoration method that utilizes sharp structural details from short-exposure images, facilitating accurate reconstruction of heavily blurred regions. Furthermore, to restore images realistically and visually-pleasant, we develop a short-exposure guided diffusion model that explores useful features from short-exposure images and blurred regions to better constrain the diffusion process. Finally, we formulate the above components into a simple yet effective network, named ExpRDiff. Experimental results show that ExpRDiff performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/yzb1997/ExpRDiff</p></details> |

In particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack a unified training benchmark for iterations and configurations. We also identify a bias in image complexity distributions between commonly used IR training and testing datasets, resulting in suboptimal restoration outcomes. To address this, we introduce a large-scale IR dataset called ReSyn, which employs a novel image filtering method based on image complexity to ensure a balanced distribution and includes both real and AIGC synthetic images. We establish a unified training standard that specifies iterations and configurations for image restoration models, focusing on measuring model convergence and restoration capability. Additionally, we enhance transformer-based image restoration models using linear attention mechanisms by proposing RWKV-IR, which integrates linear complexity RWKV into the transformer structure, allowing for both global and local receptive fields. Instead of directly using Vision-RWKV, we replace the original Q-Shift in RWKV with a Depth-wise Convolution shift to better model local dependencies, combined with Bi-directional attention for comprehensive linear attention. We also introduce a Cross-Bi-WKV module that merges two Bi-WKV modules with different scanning orders for balanced horizontal and vertical attention. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our RWKV-IR model.</p></details> |  |

These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a Domain Shift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring only 5 sampling steps. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency.

Single-image solutions face an inherent tradeoff between noise reduction and motion blur. While short exposures can capture clear motion, they suffer from noise amplification. Long exposures reduce noise but introduce blur. Learning-based single-image enhancers tend to be over-smooth due to the limited information. Multi-image solutions using burst mode avoid this tradeoff by capturing more spatial-temporal information but often struggle with misalignment from camera/scene motion. To address these limitations, we propose a physical-model-based image restoration approach leveraging a novel dual-exposure Quad-Bayer pattern sensor. By capturing pairs of short and long exposures at the same starting point but with varying durations, this method integrates complementary noise-blur information within a single image. We further introduce a Quad-Bayer synthesis method (B2QB) to simulate sensor data from Bayer patterns to facilitate training. Based on this dual-exposure sensor model, we design a hierarchical convolutional neural network called QRNet to recover high-quality RGB images. The network incorporates input enhancement blocks and multi-level feature extraction to improve restoration quality. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art deblurring and denoising methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address these problems, we propose a novel progressive restoration network for high-order degradation imaging (HDI-PRNet), to progressively restore different image degradation. HDI-PRNet is developed based on the theoretical framework of degradation imaging, offering the benefit of mathematical interpretability within the unfolding network. The framework is composed of three main components: a module for image denoising that relies on proximal mapping prior learning, a module for image deblurring that integrates Neumann series expansion with dual-domain degradation learning, and a module for super-resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real remote sensing images.</p></details> | 14 pages |

To address these issues, we introduce InstantRestore, a novel framework that leverages a single-step image diffusion model and an attention-sharing mechanism for fast and personalized face restoration. Additionally, InstantRestore incorporates a novel landmark attention loss, aligning key facial landmarks to refine the attention maps, enhancing identity preservation. At inference time, given a degraded input and a small (~4) set of reference images, InstantRestore performs a single forward pass through the network to achieve near real-time performance.

To address this, we propose using text as an auxiliary invariant representation to reactivate the generative capabilities of these models. We begin by identifying two key properties of text input: richness and relevance, and examine their respective influence on model performance. Building on these insights, we introduce Res-Captioner, a module that generates enhanced textual descriptions tailored to image content and degradation levels, effectively mitigating response failures.

Despite its advantage in miniaturization, its practicality is constrained by severe aberrations and distortions, which significantly degrade the image quality. Several previous arts have attempted to address different types of aberrations, yet most of them are mainly designed for the traditional bulky lens and not convincing enough to remedy harsh aberrations of the metalens. While there have existed aberration correction methods specifically for metalens, they still fall short of restoration quality. In this work, we propose MetaFormer, an aberration correction framework for metalens-captured images, harnessing Vision Transformers (ViT) that has shown remarkable restoration performance in diverse image restoration tasks. Specifically, we devise a Multiple Adaptive Filters Guidance (MAFG), where multiple Wiener filters enrich the degraded input images with various noise-detail balances, enhancing output restoration quality. In addition, we introduce a Spatial and Transposed self-Attention Fusion (STAF) module, which aggregates features from spatial self-attention and transposed self-attention modules to further ameliorate aberration correction.

Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</p></details> |  |

To address such visual degradations, a variety of approaches have been proposed covering from basic signal processing methods to deep learning models; however, none of them has proven to be consistently successful. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model, Co-Operational Regressor Networks (CoRe-Nets), designed to achieve the best possible underwater image restoration. A CoRe-Net consists of two co-operating networks: the Apprentice Regressor (AR), responsible for image transformation, and the Master Regressor (MR), which evaluates the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the images generated by the AR and feeds it back to AR. CoRe-Nets are built on Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs), which offer a superior learning capability by modulating nonlinearity in kernel transformations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated on the benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset. Leveraging the joint learning capabilities of the two cooperating networks, the proposed model achieves the state-of-art restoration performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and often presents such results that can even surpass the visual quality of the ground truth with a 2-pass application.

Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688v2)** | 2024-12-04 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2410.08688v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite previous image restoration (IR) methods have often concentrated on isolated degradations, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations involving a complex combination of multiple isolated degradations. However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/toummHus/Chain-of-Restoration</p></details> |

However, these methods sometimes fail to recognize some salient objects, resulting in inaccurate semantic restoration in these regions. Additionally, the same region may have a strong response to more than one prompt and it will lead to semantic ambiguity for image super-resolution. To alleviate the above two issues, in this paper, we propose to consider semantic segmentation as an additional control condition into diffusion-based image super-resolution. Compared to textual prompt conditions, semantic segmentation enables a more comprehensive perception of salient objects within an image by assigning class labels to each pixel. It also mitigates the risks of semantic ambiguities by explicitly allocating objects to their respective spatial regions. In practice, inspired by the fact that image super-resolution and segmentation can benefit each other, we propose SegSR which introduces a dual-diffusion framework to facilitate interaction between the image super-resolution and segmentation diffusion models. Specifically, we develop a Dual-Modality Bridge module to enable updated information flow between these two diffusion models, achieving mutual benefit during the reverse diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that SegSR can generate realistic images while preserving semantic structures more effectively.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, large-scale high-quality real-world training data is urgently needed to facilitate the emergence of foundational models for image restoration. To advance this field, we spare no effort in contributing a million-scale dataset with two notable advantages over existing training data: real-world samples with larger-scale, and degradation types with higher diversity. By adjusting internal camera settings and external imaging conditions, we can capture aligned image pairs using our well-designed data acquisition system over multiple rounds and our data alignment criterion. Moreover, we propose a robust model, FoundIR, to better address a broader range of restoration tasks in real-world scenarios, taking a further step toward foundation models. Specifically, we first utilize a diffusion-based generalist model to remove degradations by learning the degradation-agnostic common representations from diverse inputs, where incremental learning strategy is adopted to better guide model training. To refine the model's restoration capability in complex scenarios, we introduce degradation-aware specialist models for achieving final high-quality results.

Existing methods often depend on restrictive assumptions such as additional training, operator linearity, or narrow image distributions, thus limiting their generalizability. In this work, we present LADiBI, a training-free framework that uses large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to solve blind inverse problems with minimal assumptions. By leveraging natural language prompts, LADiBI jointly models priors for both the target image and operator, allowing for flexible adaptation across a variety of tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel posterior sampling approach that combines effective operator initialization with iterative refinement, enabling LADiBI to operate without predefined operator forms.

However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications.

| **[Hierarchical Information Flow for Generalized Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18588v1)** | 2024-11-27 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.18588v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision transformers show promise in numerous image restoration (IR) tasks, the challenge remains in efficiently generalizing and scaling up a model for multiple IR tasks. To strike a balance between efficiency and model capacity for a generalized transformer-based IR method, we propose a hierarchical information flow mechanism for image restoration, dubbed Hi-IR, which progressively propagates information among pixels in a bottom-up manner. Hi-IR constructs a hierarchical information tree representing the degraded image across three levels. Each level encapsulates different types of information, with higher levels encompassing broader objects and concepts and lower levels focusing on local details. Moreover, the hierarchical tree architecture removes long-range self-attention, improves the computational efficiency and memory utilization, thus preparing it for effective model scaling. Based on that, we explore model scaling to improve our method's capabilities, which is expected to positively impact IR in large-scale training settings. Extensive experimental results show that Hi-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance in seven common image restoration tasks, affirming its effectiveness and generalizability.</p></details> |  |

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

However, these models require all the possible degradation types to be defined during the training stage while showing limited generalization to unseen degradations, which limits their practical application in complex cases. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model, which can address multiple degradations, generalizes well to unseen degradations, and efficiently incorporate new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. First, we train our baseline model on a large dataset of natural images with multiple synthetic degradations, augmented with a segmentation head to estimate per-pixel degradation types, resulting in a powerful backbone able to generalize to a wide range of degradations. Second, we adapt our baseline model to varying image restoration tasks using independent low-rank adapters. Third, we learn to adaptively combine adapters to versatile images via a flexible and lightweight degradation estimator. Our model is both powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, it not only outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin on five- and three-task IR setups, but also shows improved generalization to unseen degradations and also composite distortions.</p></details> | 17 pages |

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint. under review.

AWIR models are trained to address a specific set of weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow. But this causes them to often struggle with out-of-distribution (OoD) samples or unseen degradations which limits their effectiveness for real-world autonomous navigation. To overcome this issue, existing models must either be retrained or fine-tuned, both of which are inefficient and impractical, with retraining needing access to large datasets, and fine-tuning involving many parameters. In this paper, we propose using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt a pre-trained all-weather model to novel weather restoration tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LoRA lowers the performance of the adapted model on the pre-trained restoration tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a LoRA-based fine-tuning method called LoRA-Align (LoRA-A) which seeks to align the singular vectors of the fine-tuned and pre-trained weight matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This alignment helps preserve the model's knowledge of its original tasks while adapting it to unseen tasks. We show that images restored with LoRA and LoRA-A can be effectively used for computer vision tasks in autonomous navigation, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sudraj2002.github.io/loraapage/</p></details> |

However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR.

However, automatically assessing the quality of novel views and identifying artifacts is challenging due to the lack of ground truth images and the limitations of no-reference image metrics in predicting detailed artifact maps. The absence of such quality metrics hinders accurate predictions of the quality of generated views and limits the adoption of post-processing techniques, such as inpainting, to enhance reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a new no-reference metric, Puzzle Similarity, which is designed to localize artifacts in novel views. Our approach utilizes image patch statistics from the input views to establish a scene-specific distribution that is later used to identify poorly reconstructed regions in the novel views. We test and evaluate our method in the context of 3D reconstruction; to this end, we collected a novel dataset of human quality assessment in unseen reconstructed views. Through this dataset, we demonstrate that our method can not only successfully localize artifacts in novel views, correlating with human assessment, but do so without direct references. Surprisingly, our metric outperforms both no-reference metrics and popular full-reference image metrics. We can leverage our new metric to enhance applications like automatic image restoration, guided acquisition, or 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing weather restoration approaches are only capable of handling a specific type of degradation, which is often insufficient in real-world scenarios, such as rainy-snowy or rainy-hazy weather. Towards being able to address these situations, we propose a multi-weather Transformer, or MWFormer for short, which is a holistic vision Transformer that aims to solve multiple weather-induced degradations using a single, unified architecture. MWFormer uses hyper-networks and feature-wise linear modulation blocks to restore images degraded by various weather types using the same set of learned parameters. We first employ contrastive learning to train an auxiliary network that extracts content-independent, distortion-aware feature embeddings that efficiently represent predicted weather types, of which more than one may occur. Guided by these weather-informed predictions, the image restoration Transformer adaptively modulates its parameters to conduct both local and global feature processing, in response to multiple possible weather. Moreover, MWFormer allows for a novel way of tuning, during application, to either a single type of weather restoration or to hybrid weather restoration without any retraining, offering greater controllability than existing methods. Our experimental results on multi-weather restoration benchmarks show that MWFormer achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, without requiring much computational cost. Moreover, we demonstrate that our methodology of using hyper-networks can be integrated into various network architectures to further boost their performance.

To address these challenges, our approach begins with a comprehensive pre-processing workflow that encompasses deep learning-based image restoration, feature point extraction and camera pose initialization. We apply a customized Structure from Motion (SfM) approach, followed by an improved 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, to achieve high-fidelity 3D model reconstruction. Our technique supports simultaneous 3D Gaussian training and pose estimation, enabling the robust generation of intricate 3D point clouds from sparse, noisy data. The procedure is further bolstered by a post-editing phase designed to eliminate noise points inconsistent with our prior knowledge of a satellite's geometric constraints. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and actual observations of China's Space Station and International Space Station, showcasing its significant advantages over existing methods in reconstructing 3D space objects from ground-based observations.</p></details> |  |

To dynamically balance the brightness in output images, we also introduce a Fourier transform module that adjusts the luminance channel in the frequency domain. This mechanism could uniformly balance brightness across different regions while eliminating background noises, and thereby enhancing visual quality. By combining these innovative components, LTCF-Net effectively improves low-light image quality while keeping the model lightweight.

However, existing multi-task approaches typically rely on augmenting the model with additional parameters to handle multiple scenarios. While this enables the model to address diverse tasks, the introduction of extra parameters significantly complicates its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-Guided Parameter Mask for Multi-Scenario Image Restoration under adverse weather, designed to effectively handle image degradation under diverse weather conditions without additional parameters. Our method segments model parameters into common and specific components by evaluating the gradient variation intensity during training for each specific weather condition. This enables the model to precisely and adaptively learn relevant features for each weather scenario, improving both efficiency and effectiveness without compromising on performance. This method constructs specific masks based on gradient fluctuations to isolate parameters influenced by other tasks, ensuring that the model achieves strong performance across all scenarios without adding extra parameters. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our framework through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.

To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for IR that significantly reduces the required number of diffusion steps. Our method avoids the need for post-acceleration during inference, thereby avoiding the associated performance deterioration. Specifically, our proposed method establishes a Markov chain that facilitates the transitions between the high-quality and low-quality images by shifting their residuals, substantially improving the transition efficiency. A carefully formulated noise schedule is devised to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on three classical IR tasks, namely image super-resolution, image inpainting, and blind face restoration, \textit{\textbf{even only with four sampling steps}}.

When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

Specifically, by establishing a direct correspondence between algorithm operators at each implementation step and network modules within each layer, one can rationally construct an almost ``white box'' network architecture with high interpretability. In this architecture, only the predefined component of the proximal operator, known as a proximal network, needs manual configuration, enabling the network to automatically extract intrinsic image priors in a data-driven manner. In current deep unfolding methods, such a proximal network is generally designed as a CNN architecture, whose necessity has been proven by a recent theory. That is, CNN structure substantially delivers the translational invariant image prior, which is the most universally possessed structural prior across various types of images. However, standard CNN-based proximal networks have essential limitations in capturing the rotation symmetry prior, another universal structural prior underlying general images. This leaves a large room for further performance improvement in deep unfolding approaches. To address this issue, this study makes efforts to suggest a high-accuracy rotation equivariant proximal network that effectively embeds rotation symmetry priors into the deep unfolding framework. Especially, we deduce, for the first time, the theoretical equivariant error for such a designed proximal network with arbitrary layers under arbitrary rotation degrees. This analysis should be the most refined theoretical conclusion for such error evaluation to date and is also indispensable for supporting the rationale behind such networks with intrinsic interpretability requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose TSFormer, an all-in-one framework that integrates \textbf{T}rusted learning with \textbf{S}parsification to boost both generalization capability and computational efficiency in UHD image restoration. The key is that only a small amount of token movement is allowed within the model. To efficiently filter tokens, we use Min-$p$ with random matrix theory to quantify the uncertainty of tokens, thereby improving the robustness of the model. Our model can run a 4K image in real time (40fps) with 3.38 M parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSFormer achieves state-of-the-art restoration quality while enhancing generalization and reducing computational demands. In addition, our token filtering method can be applied to other image restoration models to effectively accelerate inference and maintain performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |

However, because cataract patients may also suffer from other blinding eye diseases, ophthalmologists must diagnose them before surgery. The cloudy lens of cataract patients forms a hazy degeneration in the fundus images, making it challenging to observe the patient's fundus vessels, which brings difficulties to the diagnosis process. To address this issue, this paper establishes a new cataract image restoration method named Catintell. It contains a cataract image synthesizing model, Catintell-Syn, and a restoration model, Catintell-Res. Catintell-Syn uses GAN architecture with fully unsupervised data to generate paired cataract-like images with realistic style and texture rather than the conventional Gaussian degradation algorithm. Meanwhile, Catintell-Res is an image restoration network that can improve the quality of real cataract fundus images using the knowledge learned from synthetic cataract images. Extensive experiments show that Catintell-Res outperforms other cataract image restoration methods in PSNR with 39.03 and SSIM with 0.9476. Furthermore, the universal restoration ability that Catintell-Res gained from unpaired cataract images can process cataract images from various datasets. We hope the models can help ophthalmologists identify other blinding eye diseases of cataract patients and inspire more medical image restoration methods in the future.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the effectiveness of All-in-One image restoration models in addressing various unknown degradations simultaneously. However, these existing methods typically utilize the same parameters to tackle images with different types of degradation, forcing the model to balance the performance between different tasks and limiting its performance on each task. To alleviate this issue, we propose HAIR, a Hypernetworks-based All-in-One Image Restoration plug-and-play method that generates parameters based on the input image and thus makes the model to adapt to specific degradation dynamically. Specifically, HAIR consists of two main components, i.e., Classifier and Hyper Selecting Net (HSN). The Classifier is a simple image classification network used to generate a Global Information Vector (GIV) that contains the degradation information of the input image, and the HSN is a simple fully-connected neural network that receives the GIV and outputs parameters for the corresponding modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAIR can significantly improve the performance of existing image restoration models in a plug-and-play manner, both in single-task and All-in-One settings. Notably, our proposed model Res-HAIR, which integrates HAIR into the well-known Restormer, can obtain superior or comparable performance compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve a given small enough error, our proposed HAIR requires fewer parameters in contrast to mainstream embedding-based All-in-One methods.

However, we find that these networks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through attribution analysis. This implies that the potential of Transformer is still not fully exploited in existing networks. In order to activate more input pixels for better restoration, we propose a new Hybrid Attention Transformer (HAT). It combines both channel attention and window-based self-attention schemes, thus making use of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the cross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to enhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training stage, we additionally adopt a same-task pre-training strategy to further exploit the potential of the model for further improvement. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed modules. We further scale up the model to show that the performance of the SR task can be greatly improved. Besides, we extend HAT to more image restoration applications, including real-world image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising and image compression artifacts reduction. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAT achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Nevertheless, handling the complex and diverse degradations encountered in real-world scenarios remains a significant challenge. To tackle this, we propose LoRA-IR, a flexible framework that dynamically leverages compact low-rank experts to facilitate efficient all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, LoRA-IR consists of two training stages: degradation-guided pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, we enhance the pre-trained CLIP model by introducing a simple mechanism that scales it to higher resolutions, allowing us to extract robust degradation representations that adaptively guide the IR network. In the fine-tuning stage, we refine the pre-trained IR network through low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Built upon a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, LoRA-IR dynamically integrates multiple low-rank restoration experts through a degradation-guided router. This dynamic integration mechanism significantly enhances our model's adaptability to diverse and unknown degradations in complex real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-IR achieves SOTA performance across 14 IR tasks and 29 benchmarks, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Existing approaches typically handle single or composite degradations based on scene descriptors derived from text or image embeddings. However, due to the varying proportions of different degradations within an image, these scene descriptors may not accurately differentiate between degradations, leading to suboptimal restoration in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based restoration framework, AllRestorer. In AllRestorer, we enable the model to adaptively consider all image impairments, thereby avoiding errors from scene descriptor misdirection. Specifically, we introduce an All-in-One Transformer Block (AiOTB), which adaptively removes all degradations present in a given image by modeling the relationships between all degradations and the image embedding in latent space. To accurately address different variations potentially present within the same type of degradation and minimize ambiguity, AiOTB utilizes a composite scene descriptor consisting of both image and text embeddings to define the degradation. Furthermore, AiOTB includes an adaptive weight for each degradation, allowing for precise control of the restoration intensity. By leveraging AiOTB, AllRestorer avoids misdirection caused by inaccurate scene descriptors, achieving a 5.00 dB increase in PSNR compared to the baseline on the CDD-11 dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

We propose the Probabilistic Prior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic diffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to address this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder and Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature representations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models prior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing diverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN is the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates the DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and enhance spatial coherence. Extensive experiments validate that PPTRN significantly improves restoration quality on turbulence-degraded images, setting a new benchmark in clarity and structural fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, articulating the rigs into realistic affordance-aware postures (e.g., following the context, respecting the physics and the personalities of the object) remains time-consuming and heavily relies on human labor from experienced artists. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem and design A3Syn. With a given context, such as the environment mesh and a text prompt of the desired posture, A3Syn synthesizes articulation parameters for arbitrary and open-domain rigged objects obtained from the Internet. The task is incredibly challenging due to the lack of training data, and we do not make any topological assumptions about the open-domain rigs. We propose using 2D inpainting diffusion model and several control techniques to synthesize in-context affordance information. Then, we develop an efficient bone correspondence alignment using a combination of differentiable rendering and semantic correspondence. A3Syn has stable convergence, completes in minutes, and synthesizes plausible affordance on different combinations of in-the-wild object rigs and scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://chuyu.org/research/a3syn</p></details> |

The learned model generates images that capture the distinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. We also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillation sampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of the reconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that our GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based analogy model for audio texture manipulation. Instead of conditioning on text-based instructions, our method uses paired speech examples, where one clip represents the original sound and another illustrates the desired transformation. The model learns to apply the same transformation to new input, allowing for the manipulation of sound textures. We construct a quadruplet dataset representing various editing tasks, and train a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised manner. We show through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies that our model outperforms text-conditioned baselines and generalizes to real-world, out-of-distribution, and non-speech scenarios.

Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to tune the diffusion model through assigning a per-pixel confidence map for each synthesis. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main body and 2 pages of references, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, they would produce severe artifacts in the mask center when the masked area is too large and no pixel correspondences can be found for the center. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating diverse and high-quality images, and have been exploited in a number of works for image inpainting. These methods, however, cannot be applied directly to videos to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, named VipDiff, for conditioning diffusion model on the reverse diffusion process to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models. VipDiff takes optical flow as guidance to extract valid pixels from reference frames to serve as constraints in optimizing the randomly sampled Gaussian noise, and uses the generated results for further pixel propagation and conditional generation. VipDiff also allows for generating diverse video inpainting results over different sampled noise. Experiments demonstrate that VipDiff can largely outperform state-of-the-art video inpainting methods in terms of both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 Figures (Accepted at WACV 2025)</p></details> |

Our framework can disentangle complex visual elements and attributes from as little as a single image, while enabling seamless plug-and-play generation of combinations of concepts extracted from multiple images. As opposed to existing works, TokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports a wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and lighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input text affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and scale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized control over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an optimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text description, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation space. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine the learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and showcase its advantages over existing methods. project's webpage in https://token-verse.github.io/</p></details> |  |

However, many of the generative methods applied in the latent space remain complex and difficult to train. Further, it is not entirely clear why transitioning to a lower-dimensional latent space can improve generative quality. In this work, we introduce a new and simple generative method grounded in topology theory -- Generative Topological Networks (GTNs) -- which also provides insights into why lower-dimensional latent-space representations might be better-suited for data generation. GTNs are simple to train -- they employ a standard supervised learning approach and do not suffer from common generative pitfalls such as mode collapse, posterior collapse or the need to pose constraints on the neural network architecture. We demonstrate the use of GTNs on several datasets, including MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR-10 and the Hands and Palm Images dataset by training GTNs on a lower-dimensional latent representation of the data. We show that GTNs can improve upon VAEs and that they are quick to converge, generating realistic samples in early epochs. Further, we use the topological considerations behind the development of GTNs to offer insights into why generative models may benefit from operating on a lower-dimensional latent space, highlighting the important link between the intrinsic dimension of the data and the dimension in which the data is generated. Particularly, we demonstrate that generating in high dimensional ambient spaces may be a contributing factor to out-of-distribution samples generated by diffusion models. We also highlight other topological properties that are important to consider when using and designing generative models. Our code is available at: https://github.com/alonalj/GTN</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often focus solely on text-to-image or image reference-based human generation, which fails to satisfy the increasingly sophisticated demands. To address the limitations of flexibility and precision in human generation, we introduce ComposeAnyone, a controllable layout-to-human generation method with decoupled multimodal conditions. Specifically, our method allows decoupled control of any part in hand-drawn human layouts using text or reference images, seamlessly integrating them during the generation process. The hand-drawn layout, which utilizes color-blocked geometric shapes such as ellipses and rectangles, can be easily drawn, offering a more flexible and accessible way to define spatial layouts. Additionally, we introduce the ComposeHuman dataset, which provides decoupled text and reference image annotations for different components of each human image, enabling broader applications in human image generation tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ComposeAnyone generates human images with better alignment to given layouts, text descriptions, and reference images, showcasing its multi-task capability and controllability.</p></details> |  |

Prior work shows that fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model on ImageNet and generating synthetic training images from the finetuned model can enhance an ImageNet classifier's performance. However, performance degrades as synthetic images outnumber real ones. In this paper, we explore whether generative fine-tuning is essential for this improvement and whether it is possible to further scale up training using more synthetic data. We present a new framework leveraging off-the-shelf generative models to generate synthetic training images, addressing multiple challenges: class name ambiguity, lack of diversity in naive prompts, and domain shifts. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and CLIP to resolve class name ambiguity. To diversify images, we propose contextualized diversification (CD) and stylized diversification (SD) methods, also prompted by LLMs. Finally, to mitigate domain shifts, we leverage domain adaptation techniques with auxiliary batch normalization for synthetic images. Our framework consistently enhances recognition model performance with more synthetic data, up to 6x of original ImageNet size showcasing the potential of synthetic data for improved recognition models and strong out-of-domain generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we present EliGen, a novel framework for Entity-Level controlled Image Generation. We introduce regional attention, a mechanism for diffusion transformers that requires no additional parameters, seamlessly integrating entity prompts and arbitrary-shaped spatial masks. By contributing a high-quality dataset with fine-grained spatial and semantic entity-level annotations, we train EliGen to achieve robust and accurate entity-level manipulation, surpassing existing methods in both spatial precision and image quality. Additionally, we propose an inpainting fusion pipeline, extending EliGen's capabilities to multi-entity image inpainting tasks.

The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling users to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in realistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human forms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations, offered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance of deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their dependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great visuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the current crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and warping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON, a new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system includes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero cross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human body. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been tweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The training process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully incorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on results and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset, supplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 7 pages |

While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling capabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require sample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in proteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models can be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial explores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review these methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques -- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling, and classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes (a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value functions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states to terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms not yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning methods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms based on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received limited attention in current research, and (3) connections between inference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.

Diffusion models are the newcomers to this arena, posing the strongest known prior to date. Recently, such models operating in a latent space have become increasingly predominant due to their efficiency. In recent works, these models have been applied to solve inverse problems. Working in the latent space typically requires multiple applications of an Autoencoder during the restoration process, which leads to both computational and restoration quality challenges. In this work, we propose a new approach for handling inverse problems with latent diffusion models, where a learned degradation function operates within the latent space, emulating a known image space degradation. Usage of the learned operator reduces the dependency on the Autoencoder to only the initial and final steps of the restoration process, facilitating faster sampling and superior restoration quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of image restoration tasks and datasets, achieving significant improvements over prior art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page in https://ronraphaeli.github.io/SILO-website/</p></details> |

Prior efforts mostly follow the embedding-and-mapping paradigm, which first integrate the preference into user representation in the source domain, and then perform a mapping function on this representation to the target domain. However, they focus on mapping features across domains, neglecting to explicitly model the preference integration process, which may lead to learning coarse user representation. Diffusion models (DMs), which contribute to more accurate user/item representations due to their explicit information injection capability, have achieved promising performance in recommendation systems. Nevertheless, these DMs-based methods cannot directly account for valuable user preference in other domains, leading to challenges in adapting to the transfer of preference for cold-start users. Consequently, the feasibility of DMs for CDR remains underexplored. To this end, we explore to utilize the explicit information injection capability of DMs for user preference integration and propose a Preference-Guided Diffusion Model for CDR to cold-start users, termed as DMCDR. Specifically, we leverage a preference encoder to establish the preference guidance signal with the user's interaction history in the source domain. Then, we explicitly inject the preference guidance signal into the user representation step by step to guide the reverse process, and ultimately generate the personalized user representation in the target domain, thus achieving the transfer of user preference across domains. Furthermore, we comprehensively explore the impact of six DMs-based variants on CDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by KDD'2025</p></details> |

Existing graph purification methods attempt to address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to effectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously due to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph data due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against adversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense Diffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the denoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature of diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial attacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding and removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their original structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1) Graph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph during the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains consistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained Regularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further enhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising strategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the model's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial attacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |

However, the key components of the best performing LDM training recipes are oftentimes not available to the research community, preventing apple-to-apple comparisons and hindering the validation of progress in the field. In this work, we perform an in-depth study of LDM training recipes focusing on the performance of models and their training efficiency. To ensure apple-to-apple comparisons, we re-implement five previously published models with their corresponding recipes. Through our study, we explore the effects of (i)~the mechanisms used to condition the generative model on semantic information (e.g., text prompt) and control metadata (e.g., crop size, random flip flag, etc.) on the model performance, and (ii)~the transfer of the representations learned on smaller and lower-resolution datasets to larger ones on the training efficiency and model performance.

Although significant breakthroughs have been made and empirical success has been achieved with the GAN, its mathematical underpinnings remain relatively unknown. This paper focuses on a rigorous mathematical theoretical framework: the composite-functional-gradient GAN (CFG)[1]. Specifically, we reveal the theoretical connection between the CFG model and score-based models. We find that the training objective of the CFG discriminator is equivalent to finding an optimal D(x). The optimal gradient of D(x) differentiates the integral of the differences between the score functions of real and synthesized samples. Conversely, training the CFG generator involves finding an optimal G(x) that minimizes this difference. In this paper, we aim to derive an annealed weight preceding the weight of the CFG discriminator. This new explicit theoretical explanation model is called the annealed CFG method. To overcome the limitation of the annealed CFG method, as the method is not readily applicable to the SOTA GAN model, we propose a nested annealed training scheme (NATS). This scheme keeps the annealed weight from the CFG method and can be seamlessly adapted to various GAN models, no matter their structural, loss, or regularization differences. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets for image generation. The results show that our annealed CFG and NATS methods significantly improve the quality and diversity of the synthesized samples. This improvement is clear when comparing the CFG method and the SOTA GAN models.</p></details> |  |

While these methods demonstrate promising performance for single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data because the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness against the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such methods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal data to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is often costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to compute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal image matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we propose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid aggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on single-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion models. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection and description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA, CF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and Optical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is able to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without accessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability. The source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, it incurs significant computation overheads due to its iterative structure. To address these overheads, we analyze this iterative structure and observe that adjacent time steps in diffusion models exhibit high value similarity, leading to narrower differences between consecutive time steps. We adapt these characteristics to a quantized diffusion model and reveal that the majority of these differences can be represented with reduced bit-width, and even zero. Based on our observations, we propose the Ditto algorithm, a difference processing algorithm that leverages temporal similarity with quantization to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models. By exploiting the narrower differences and the distributive property of layer operations, it performs full bit-width operations for the initial time step and processes subsequent steps with temporal differences. In addition, Ditto execution flow optimization is designed to mitigate the memory overhead of temporal difference processing, further boosting the efficiency of the Ditto algorithm. We also design the Ditto hardware, a specialized hardware accelerator, fully exploiting the dynamic characteristics of the proposed algorithm. As a result, the Ditto hardware achieves up to 1.5x speedup and 17.74% energy saving compared to other accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2025)</p></details> |

Existing defense mechanisms rely on computationally intensive adversarial perturbations tailored to individual images, rendering them impractical for real-world deployment. This study introduces the Real-time Identity Defender (RID), a neural network designed to generate adversarial perturbations through a single forward pass, bypassing the need for image-specific optimization. RID achieves unprecedented efficiency, with defense times as low as 0.12 seconds on a single NVIDIA A100 80G GPU (4,400 times faster than leading methods) and 1.1 seconds per image on a standard Intel i9 CPU, making it suitable for edge devices such as smartphones. Despite its efficiency, RID achieves promising protection performance across visual and quantitative benchmarks, effectively mitigating identity replication risks. Our analysis reveals that RID's perturbations mimic the efficacy of traditional defenses while exhibiting properties distinct from natural noise, such as Gaussian perturbations. To enhance robustness, we extend RID into an ensemble framework that integrates multiple pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, ensuring resilience against black-box attacks and post-processing techniques, including image compression and purification. Our model is envisioned to play a crucial role in safeguarding portrait rights, thereby preventing illegal and unethical uses.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures (RID)</p></details> |

Effectively representing social dynamics is challenging because we require multi-modal, synchronized observations to understand a scene. We explore how using a single modality, the pose behavior, of multiple individuals in a social interaction can be used to generate nonverbal social cues for the facilitator of that interaction. The facilitator acts to make a social interaction proceed smoothly and is an essential role for intelligent agents to replicate in human-robot interactions. In this paper, we adapt an existing diffusion behavior cloning model to learn and replicate facilitator behaviors. Furthermore, we evaluate two representations of pose observations from a scene, one representation has pre-processing applied and one does not. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new use for diffusion behavior cloning for pose generation in social interactions. The second is to understand the relationship between performance and computational load for generating social pose behavior using two different techniques for collecting scene observations. As such, we are essentially testing the effectiveness of two different types of conditioning for a diffusion model. We then evaluate the resulting generated behavior from each technique using quantitative measures such as mean per-joint position error (MPJPE), training time, and inference time. Additionally, we plot training and inference time against MPJPE to examine the trade-offs between efficiency and performance.

In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

This problem is exacerbated when there is not just one output label, but a set of them. This is the case for multilabel learning (MLL) algorithms used to classify patterns, rank labels, or learn the distribution of outputs. Many solutions have been proposed in the literature. The one that can be applied universally, independent of the algorithm used to build the model, is data resampling. The generation of new instances associated with minority labels, so that empty areas of the feature space are filled, helps to improve the obtained models. The quality of these new instances depends on the algorithm used to generate them. In this paper, a diffusion model tailored to produce new instances for MLL data, called MLDM (\textit{MultiLabel Diffusion Model}), is proposed. Diffusion models have been mainly used to generate artificial images and videos. Our proposed MLDM is based on this type of models. The experiments conducted compare MLDM with several other MLL resampling algorithms. The results show that MLDM is competitive while it improves efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Yet, the joint synthesis of (image, mask) pairs for segmentation, a major application in surgery, is rather unexplored. We propose to learn semantically comprehensive yet compact latent representations of the (image, mask) space, which we jointly model with a Latent Diffusion Model. We show that our approach can effectively synthesise unseen high-quality paired segmentation data of remarkable semantic coherence. Generative augmentation is typically applied pre-training by synthesising a fixed number of additional training samples to improve downstream task models. To enhance this approach, we further propose Generative Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Diffusion-based Augmentation (GAUDA), leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of a Bayesian downstream model for targeted online synthesis. We condition the generative model on classes with high estimated uncertainty during training to produce additional unseen samples for these classes. By adaptively utilising the generative model online, we can minimise the number of additional training samples and centre them around the currently most uncertain parts of the data distribution. GAUDA effectively improves downstream segmentation results over comparable methods by an average absolute IoU of 1.6% on CaDISv2 and 1.5% on CholecSeg8k, two prominent surgical datasets for semantic segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Previous diffusion-based SR methods suffer from slow inference due to the need for a large number of sampling steps. In this paper, we introduce FlashSR, a single-step diffusion model for versatile audio super-resolution aimed at producing 48kHz audio. FlashSR achieves fast inference by utilizing diffusion distillation with three objectives: distillation loss, adversarial loss, and distribution-matching distillation loss. We further enhance performance by proposing the SR Vocoder, which is specifically designed for SR models operating on mel-spectrograms. FlashSR demonstrates competitive performance with the current state-of-the-art model in both objective and subjective evaluations while being approximately 22 times faster.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

However, these models typically rely on the same predetermined denoising schedules during inference for each prompt, which potentially limits the inference efficiency as well as the flexibility when handling different prompts. In this paper, we argue that the optimal noise schedule should adapt to each inference instance, and introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) to accomplish this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning, aiming to maximize a reward that discounts the final image quality by the number of denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts the number of denoising steps and time on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. We train TPDMs on multiple diffusion model benchmarks. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance. We will release our best model alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often face a dilemma: lightweight approaches, such as adapters, are prone to generate inconsistent textures; while finetune-based methods involve high training costs and struggle to maintain the generalization capabilities of pretrained diffusion models, limiting their performance across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamFit, which incorporates a lightweight Anything-Dressing Encoder specifically tailored for the garment-centric human generation. DreamFit has three key advantages: (1) \textbf{Lightweight training}: with the proposed adaptive attention and LoRA modules, DreamFit significantly minimizes the model complexity to 83.4M trainable parameters. (2)\textbf{Anything-Dressing}: Our model generalizes surprisingly well to a wide range of (non-)garments, creative styles, and prompt instructions, consistently delivering high-quality results across diverse scenarios. (3) \textbf{Plug-and-play}: DreamFit is engineered for smooth integration with any community control plugins for diffusion models, ensuring easy compatibility and minimizing adoption barriers. To further enhance generation quality, DreamFit leverages pretrained large multi-modal models (LMMs) to enrich the prompt with fine-grained garment descriptions, thereby reducing the prompt gap between training and inference. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both $768 \times 512$ high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild images. DreamFit surpasses all existing methods, highlighting its state-of-the-art capabilities of garment-centric human generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods that focus on generating full-body or half-body poses, we investigate the challenges of co-speech gesture generation and identify the weak correspondence between audio features and full-body gestures as a key limitation. To address this, we redefine the task as a two-stage process. In the first stage, we generate hand poses directly from audio input, leveraging the strong correlation between audio signals and hand movements. In the second stage, we employ a diffusion model to synthesize video frames, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce realistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, such as CyberHost and Vlogger, in terms of both visual quality and synchronization accuracy. This work provides a new perspective on audio-driven gesture generation and a robust framework for creating expressive and natural talking head animations.</p></details> |  |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[Golden Noise for Diffusion Models: A Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09502v4)** | 2025-01-18 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2411.09502v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion model is a popular paradigm that synthesizes personalized images by providing a text prompt and a random Gaussian noise. While people observe that some noises are ``golden noises'' that can achieve better text-image alignment and higher human preference than others, we still lack a machine learning framework to obtain those golden noises. To learn golden noises for diffusion sampling, we mainly make three contributions in this paper. First, we identify a new concept termed the \textit{noise prompt}, which aims at turning a random Gaussian noise into a golden noise by adding a small desirable perturbation derived from the text prompt. Following the concept, we first formulate the \textit{noise prompt learning} framework that systematically learns ``prompted'' golden noise associated with a text prompt for diffusion models. Second, we design a noise prompt data collection pipeline and collect a large-scale \textit{noise prompt dataset}~(NPD) that contains 100k pairs of random noises and golden noises with the associated text prompts. With the prepared NPD as the training dataset, we trained a small \textit{noise prompt network}~(NPNet) that can directly learn to transform a random noise into a golden noise. The learned golden noise perturbation can be considered as a kind of prompt for noise, as it is rich in semantic information and tailored to the given text prompt. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive effectiveness and generalization of NPNet on improving the quality of synthesized images across various diffusion models, including SDXL, DreamShaper-xl-v2-turbo, and Hunyuan-DiT. Moreover, NPNet is a small and efficient controller that acts as a plug-and-play module with very limited additional inference and computational costs, as it just provides a golden noise instead of a random noise without accessing the original pipeline.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling framework (LDSeg) for medical image segmentation, utilizing the learned inherent low-dimensional latent shape manifolds of the target objects and the embeddings of the source image with an end-to-end framework. Conditional diffusion in latent space not only ensures accurate image segmentation for multiple interacting objects, but also tackles the fundamental issues of traditional DPM-based segmentation methods: (1) high memory consumption, (2) time-consuming sampling process, and (3) unnatural noise injection in the forward and reverse processes. The end-to-end training strategy enables robust representation learning in the latent space related to segmentation features, ensuring significantly faster sampling from the posterior distribution for segmentation generation in the inference phase. Our experiments demonstrate that LDSeg achieved state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on three medical image datasets with different imaging modalities. In addition, we showed that our proposed model was significantly more robust to noise compared to traditional deterministic segmentation models.

With the rise of deep learning, common solutions have leveraged neural networks to facilitate collaborative filtering, and some have turned to generative adversarial networks to augment the dataset and tackle the data sparsity issue. However, they are limited in learning the complex user and item distribution and still suffer from model collapse. Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Diffusion models in recommender systems excel in managing complex user and item distributions and do not suffer from mode collapse. With these advantages, the amount of research in this domain have been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy on past research papers in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundation algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |

In reinforcement learning (RL), model-based RL learns a dynamics model of the world, in principle enabling transfer to arbitrary reward functions through planning. However, autoregressive model rollouts suffer from compounding error, making model-based RL ineffective for long-horizon problems. Successor features offer an alternative by modeling a policy's long-term state occupancy, reducing policy evaluation under new rewards to linear regression. Yet, zero-shot policy optimization for new tasks with successor features can be challenging. This work proposes a novel class of models, i.e., Distributional Successor Features for Zero-Shot Policy Optimization (DiSPOs), that learn a distribution of successor features of a stationary dataset's behavior policy, along with a policy that acts to realize different successor features achievable within the dataset. By directly modeling long-term outcomes in the dataset, DiSPOs avoid compounding error while enabling a simple scheme for zero-shot policy optimization across reward functions. We present a practical instantiation of DiSPOs using diffusion models and show their efficacy as a new class of transferable models, both theoretically and empirically across various simulated robotics problems.

The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

This study addresses these issues by distilling a constructive PCG algorithm into a controllable PCGML model. We first generate a large amount of content with a constructive algorithm and label it using a Large Language Model (LLM). We use these synthetic labels to condition two PCGML models for content-specific generation, a diffusion model and the five-dollar model. This neural network distillation process ensures that the generation aligns with the original algorithm while introducing controllability through plain text. We define this text-conditioned PCGML as a Text-to-game-Map (T2M) task, offering an alternative to prevalent text-to-image multi-modal tasks. We compare our distilled models with the baseline constructive algorithm. Our analysis of the variety, accuracy, and quality of our generation demonstrates the efficacy of distilling constructive methods into controllable text-conditioned PCGML models.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

To address these obstacles, we integrate the category commonality and personalized style into diffusion models. Concretely, we propose a Category-Wise Generator to enable large-scale background generation with only one model for the first time. A unique identifier in the prompt is assigned to each category, whose attention is located on the background by a mask-guided cross attention layer to learn the category-wise style. Furthermore, for products with specific and fine-grained requirements in layout, elements, etc, a Personality-Wise Generator is devised to learn such personalized style directly from a reference image to resolve textual ambiguities, and is trained in a self-supervised manner for more efficient training data usage. To advance research in this field, the first large-scale e-commerce product background generation dataset BG60k is constructed, which covers more than 60k product images from over 2k categories.

Despite the revolutionary image generation ability, current state-of-the-art models still struggle to deal with multi-concept generation accurately in many cases. This phenomenon is known as ``concept bleeding" and displays as the unexpected overlapping or merging of various concepts. This paper presents a general approach for text-to-image diffusion models to address the mutual interference between different subjects and their attachments in complex scenes, pursuing better text-image consistency. The core idea is to isolate the synthesizing processes of different concepts. We propose to bind each attachment to corresponding subjects separately with split text prompts. Besides, we introduce a revision method to fix the concept bleeding problem in multi-subject synthesis. We first depend on pre-trained object detection and segmentation models to obtain the layouts of subjects. Then we isolate and resynthesize each subject individually with corresponding text prompts to avoid mutual interference. Overall, we achieve a training-free strategy, named Isolated Diffusion, to optimize multi-concept text-to-image synthesis. It is compatible with the latest Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and prior Stable Diffusion (SD) models. We compare our approach with alternative methods using a variety of multi-concept text prompts and demonstrate its effectiveness with clear advantages in text-image consistency and user study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that integrates a conditional latent diffusion model (cLDM) with dual-context learning (DCL). Our method utilizes a variational autoencoder (VAE) to compress mel-spectrograms into a low-dimensional latent space. We then apply cLDM to transform the latent representations of both clean speech and background noise into Gaussian noise by the DCL process, and a parameterized model is trained to reverse this process, conditioned on noisy latent representations and text embeddings. By operating in a lower-dimensional space, the latent representations reduce the complexity of the generation process, while the DCL process enhances the model's ability to handle diverse and unseen noise environments. Our experiments demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed approach compared to existing diffusion-based methods, even with fewer iterative steps, and highlight the superior generalization capability of our models to out-of-domain noise datasets (https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio).</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

We explore the performance of multiple GAN frameworks, and design a new DM framework for unsupervised multi-domain styletransfer. We constrain the generation of 3D fMRI statistic maps using the latent space of an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes statistic maps from different pipelines and extend traditional sampling techniques used in DM to improve the transition performance.

However, these approaches often encounter blurring and temporal inconsistencies when dealing with large masks, highlighting the need for models with enhanced generative capabilities. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a prominent technique in image and video generation due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we introduce DiffuEraser, a video inpainting model based on stable diffusion, designed to fill masked regions with greater details and more coherent structures. We incorporate prior information to provide initialization and weak conditioning,which helps mitigate noisy artifacts and suppress hallucinations. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency during long-sequence inference, we expand the temporal receptive fields of both the prior model and DiffuEraser, and further enhance consistency by leveraging the temporal smoothing property of Video Diffusion Models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both content completeness and temporal consistency while maintaining acceptable efficiency.</p></details> | 11pages, 13figures |

X-ray scanners have low radiation exposure, but their resolutions are low. This paper proposes a new conditional diffusion model, DX2CT, that reconstructs three-dimensional (3D) CT volumes from bi or mono-planar X-ray image(s). Proposed DX2CT consists of two key components: 1) modulating feature maps extracted from two-dimensional (2D) X-ray(s) with 3D positions of CT volume using a new transformer and 2) effectively using the modulated 3D position-aware feature maps as conditions of DX2CT. In particular, the proposed transformer can provide conditions with rich information of a target CT slice to the conditional diffusion model, enabling high-quality CT reconstruction. Our experiments with the bi or mono-planar X-ray(s) benchmark datasets show that proposed DX2CT outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

Inaccurate predictions can distort our understanding of these factors, leading to misguided policies and wasted resources, which jeopardize traffic safety. A key challenge in crash frequency modelling is the prevalence of excessive zero observations, caused by underreporting, the low probability of crashes, and high data collection costs. These zero observations often reduce model accuracy and introduce bias, complicating safety decision making. While existing approaches, such as statistical methods, data aggregation, and resampling, attempt to address this issue, they either rely on restrictive assumptions or result in significant information loss, distorting crash data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid VAE-Diffusion neural network, designed to reduce zero observations and handle the complexities of multi-type tabular crash data (count, ordinal, nominal, and real-valued variables). We assess the synthetic data quality generated by this model through metrics like similarity, accuracy, diversity, and structural consistency, and compare its predictive performance against traditional statistical models. Our findings demonstrate that the hybrid VAE-Diffusion model outperforms baseline models across all metrics, offering a more effective approach to augmenting crash data and improving the accuracy of crash frequency predictions. This study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance traffic safety by improving crash frequency modelling and informing better policy decisions.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a diffusion model guided by neural operators for continuous remote sensing image super-resolution (NeurOp-Diff). Neural operators are used to learn resolution representations at arbitrary scales, encoding low-resolution (LR) images into high-dimensional features, which are then used as prior conditions to guide the diffusion model for denoising. This effectively addresses the artifacts and excessive smoothing issues present in existing super-resolution (SR) methods, enabling the generation of high-quality, continuous super-resolution images. Specifically, we adjust the super-resolution scale by a scaling factor s, allowing the model to adapt to different super-resolution magnifications. Furthermore, experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurOp-Diff. Our code is available at https://github.com/zerono000/NeurOp-Diff.</p></details> |  |

However, when a network is trained on a limited sample space, its generalization capability may be constrained, which degrades performance on unfamiliar data. For image generation tasks, this can lead to issues such as blurry details and inconsistencies between regions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a Sinogram-based Wavelet random decomposition And Random mask diffusion Model (SWARM) for SVCT reconstruction. Specifically, introducing a random mask strategy in the sinogram effectively expands the limited training sample space. This enables the model to learn a broader range of data distributions, enhancing its understanding and generalization of data uncertainty. In addition, applying a random training strategy to the high-frequency components of the sinogram wavelet enhances feature representation and improves the ability to capture details in different frequency bands, thereby improving performance and robustness. Two-stage iterative reconstruction method is adopted to ensure the global consistency of the reconstructed image while refining its details. Experimental results demonstrate that SWARM outperforms competing approaches in both quantitative and qualitative performance across various datasets.</p></details> |  |

One of the main challenges of diffusion models is solving the problem in the input space, which tends to be very high-dimensional. Recently, solving diffusion models in the latent space through an encoder that maps from the data space to a lower-dimensional latent space has been considered to make the training process more efficient and has shown state-of-the-art results. The variational autoencoder (VAE) is the most commonly used encoder/decoder framework in this domain, known for its ability to learn latent representations and generate data samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel encoder/decoder framework with theoretical properties distinct from those of the VAE, specifically designed to preserve the geometric structure of the data distribution. We demonstrate the significant advantages of this geometry-preserving encoder in the training process of both the encoder and decoder. Additionally, we provide theoretical results proving convergence of the training process, including convergence guarantees for encoder training, and results showing faster convergence of decoder training when using the geometry-preserving encoder.</p></details> | 41 pages |

These heterogeneous inputs offer significant opportunities for scene understanding but present challenges in interpreting geometry accurately, particularly in the absence of precise ground truth data. To address this, we propose CrossModalityDiffusion, a modular framework designed to generate images across different modalities and viewpoints without prior knowledge of scene geometry. CrossModalityDiffusion employs modality-specific encoders that take multiple input images and produce geometry-aware feature volumes that encode scene structure relative to their input camera positions. The space where the feature volumes are placed acts as a common ground for unifying input modalities. These feature volumes are overlapped and rendered into feature images from novel perspectives using volumetric rendering techniques. The rendered feature images are used as conditioning inputs for a modality-specific diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of novel images for the desired output modality. In this paper, we show that jointly training different modules ensures consistent geometric understanding across all modalities within the framework. We validate CrossModalityDiffusion's capabilities on the synthetic ShapeNet cars dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating accurate and consistent novel views across multiple imaging modalities and perspectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 2025 WACV workshop GeoCV</p></details> |

An intuitive alternative calls on guidance from in-the-wild image exemplars to help users bring their imagined edits to life. Contemporary exemplar-based editing methods shy away from leveraging the rich latent space learnt by pre-existing large text-to-image (TTI) models and fall back on training with curated objective functions to achieve the task. Though somewhat effective, this demands significant computational resources and lacks compatibility with diverse base models and arbitrary exemplar count. On further investigation, we also find that these techniques restrict user control to only applying uniform global changes over the entire edited region. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for progressive exemplar-driven editing with off-the-shelf diffusion models, dubbed PIXELS, to enable customization by providing granular control over edits, allowing adjustments at the pixel or region level. Our method operates solely during inference to facilitate imitative editing, enabling users to draw inspiration from a dynamic number of reference images, or multimodal prompts, and progressively incorporate all the desired changes without retraining or fine-tuning existing TTI models. This capability of fine-grained control opens up a range of new possibilities, including selective modification of individual objects and specifying gradual spatial changes. We demonstrate that PIXELS delivers high-quality edits efficiently, leading to a notable improvement in quantitative metrics as well as human evaluation. By making high-quality image editing more accessible, PIXELS has the potential to enable professional-grade edits to a wider audience with the ease of using any open-source image generation model.</p></details> |  |

We introduce simple workarounds that lead to the first complete implementation of DiffC, which is capable of compressing and decompressing images using Stable Diffusion in under 10 seconds. Despite requiring no additional training, our method is competitive with other state-of-the-art generative compression methods at low ultra-low bitrates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two training and inference strategies to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real image domains: (1) multi-task training that takes advantage of real human portraits without lighting labels; (2) an inference time diffusion sampling procedure based on classifier-free guidance that leverages the input portrait to better preserve details. Our method generalizes to diverse real photographs and produces realistic illumination effects, including specular highlights and cast shadows, while preserving the subject's identity.

Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation via the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically flatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the quality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated nature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.</p></details> |  |

LDMs learn the data distribution in the latent space of an autoencoder (AE) and produce images by mapping the generated latents into RGB image space using the AE decoder. While this approach allows for efficient model training and sampling, it induces a disconnect between the training of the diffusion model and the decoder, resulting in a loss of detail in the generated images. To remediate this disconnect, we propose to leverage the internal features of the decoder to define a latent perceptual loss (LPL). This loss encourages the models to create sharper and more realistic images. Our loss can be seamlessly integrated with common autoencoders used in latent diffusion models, and can be applied to different generative modeling paradigms such as DDPM with epsilon and velocity prediction, as well as flow matching. Extensive experiments with models trained on three datasets at 256 and 512 resolution show improved quantitative -- with boosts between 6% and 20% in FID -- and qualitative results when using our perceptual loss.</p></details> | Pre-print |

A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision.

Thus we propose a iterative pruning method based on gradient flow, including the gradient flow pruning process and the gradient flow pruning criterion. We employ a progressive soft pruning strategy to maintain the continuity of the mask matrix and guide it along the gradient flow of the energy function based on the pruning criterion in sparse space, thereby avoiding the sudden information loss typically caused by one-shot pruning. Gradient-flow based criterion prune parameters whose removal increases the gradient norm of loss function and can enable fast convergence for a pruned model in iterative pruning stage.

Despite the proliferation of 3D generation algorithms, they frequently grapple with challenges such as multi-view inconsistency, slow generation times, low fidelity, and surface reconstruction problems. While some studies have addressed some of these issues, a comprehensive solution remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CaPa}, a carve-and-paint framework that generates high-fidelity 3D assets efficiently. CaPa employs a two-stage process, decoupling geometry generation from texture synthesis. Initially, a 3D latent diffusion model generates geometry guided by multi-view inputs, ensuring structural consistency across perspectives. Subsequently, leveraging a novel, model-agnostic Spatially Decoupled Attention, the framework synthesizes high-resolution textures (up to 4K) for a given geometry. Furthermore, we propose a 3D-aware occlusion inpainting algorithm that fills untextured regions, resulting in cohesive results across the entire model. This pipeline generates high-quality 3D assets in less than 30 seconds, providing ready-to-use outputs for commercial applications.

However, generating these images, especially through Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs), in mobile edge computing environments presents significant challenges due to the limited computing resources of edge devices and the dynamic nature of wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates contract-inspired contest theory, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and GDMs to optimize image generation in these resource-constrained environments. The framework addresses the critical challenges of resource allocation and semantic data transmission quality by incentivizing edge devices to efficiently transmit high-quality semantic data, which is essential for creating realistic and immersive images. The use of contest and contract theory ensures that edge devices are motivated to allocate resources effectively, while DRL dynamically adjusts to network conditions, optimizing the overall image generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves the quality of generated images but also achieves superior convergence speed and stability compared to traditional methods. This makes the framework particularly effective for optimizing complex resource allocation tasks in mobile edge Metaverse applications, offering enhanced performance and efficiency in creating immersive virtual environments.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10figures |

Training 3D reconstruction models with 2D visual data traditionally requires prior knowledge of camera poses for the training samples, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. Consequently, 3D reconstruction training has been confined to either synthetic 3D datasets or small-scale datasets with annotated poses. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of 3D reconstruction using unposed video data of various objects. We introduce UVRM, a novel 3D reconstruction model capable of being trained and evaluated on monocular videos without requiring any information about the pose. UVRM uses a transformer network to implicitly aggregate video frames into a pose-invariant latent feature space, which is then decoded into a tri-plane 3D representation. To obviate the need for ground-truth pose annotations during training, UVRM employs a combination of the score distillation sampling (SDS) method and an analysis-by-synthesis approach, progressively synthesizing pseudo novel-views using a pre-trained diffusion model. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate UVRM's performance on the G-Objaverse and CO3D datasets without relying on pose information. Extensive experiments show that UVRM is capable of effectively and efficiently reconstructing a wide range of 3D objects from unposed videos.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

Methods: The dDiMo framework integrates temporal information from time-resolved dimensions, allowing for the concurrent capture of intra-frame spatial features and inter-frame temporal dynamics in diffusion modeling. It employs additional spatiotemporal ($x$-$t$) and self-consistent frequency-temporal ($k$-$t$) priors to guide the diffusion process. This approach ensures precise temporal alignment and enhances the recovery of fine image details. To facilitate a smooth diffusion process, the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is utilized during the reverse diffusion steps. The proposed model was tested on two types of MRI data: Cartesian-acquired multi-coil cardiac MRI and Golden-Angle-Radial-acquired multi-coil free-breathing lung MRI, across various undersampling rates. Results: dDiMo achieved high-quality reconstructions at various acceleration factors, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and structural recovery compared to other competitive reconstruction methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

To address these limitations, we propose a cross-modal design approach based on the Stable Diffusion model for generating flexible residential layouts. The method offers multiple input types for learning objectives, allowing users to specify both boundaries and layouts. It incorporates natural language as design constraints and introduces ControlNet to enable stable layout generation through two distinct pathways. We also present a scheme that encapsulates design expertise within a knowledge graph and translates it into natural language, providing an interpretable representation of design knowledge. This comprehensibility and diversity of input options enable professionals and non-professionals to directly express design requirements, enhancing flexibility and controllability. Finally, experiments verify the flexibility of the proposed methods under multimodal constraints better than state-of-the-art models, even when specific semantic information about room areas or connections is incomplete.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Framework for Inference-time Scaling and Steering of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06848v3)** | 2025-01-16 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.06848v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models produce impressive results in modalities ranging from images and video to protein design and text. However, generating samples with user-specified properties remains a challenge. Recent research proposes fine-tuning models to maximize rewards that capture desired properties, but these methods require expensive training and are prone to mode collapse. In this work, we propose Feynman Kac (FK) steering, an inference-time framework for steering diffusion models with reward functions. FK steering works by sampling a system of multiple interacting diffusion processes, called particles, and resampling particles at intermediate steps based on scores computed using functions called potentials. Potentials are defined using rewards for intermediate states and are selected such that a high value indicates that the particle will yield a high-reward sample. We explore various choices of potentials, intermediate rewards, and samplers. We evaluate FK steering on text-to-image and text diffusion models. For steering text-to-image models with a human preference reward, we find that FK steering a 0.8B parameter model outperforms a 2.6B parameter fine-tuned model on prompt fidelity, with faster sampling and no training. For steering text diffusion models with rewards for text quality and specific text attributes, we find that FK steering generates lower perplexity, more linguistically acceptable outputs and enables gradient-free control of attributes like toxicity. Our results demonstrate that inference-time scaling and steering of diffusion models, even with off-the-shelf rewards, can provide significant sample quality gains and controllability benefits.

While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

However, serving diffusion models at the entire image level faces several problems, especially when there are multiple candidate resolutions. First, image based serving system prevents requests with different resolutions from batching together. On the other hand, requests with hybrid resolutions also indicate diverse locality features, which makes it hard to apply the same cache policy to all of them. To this end, we propose PATCHEDSERVE, A Patch Management Framework for SLO-Optimized Hybrid Resolution Diffusion Serving that provides a patch-level management strategy to gather hybrid resolution requests into batches. Specifically, PATCHEDSERVE incorporates a novel patch-based processing workflow, significantly enhancing throughput for hybrid resolution inputs. Furthermore, PATCHEDSERVE designs a patch-level cache reuse policy to fully exploit the redundancy in diffusion. In addition, PATCHEDSERVE features an SLO-aware scheduling algorithm with lightweight online latency prediction, achieving higher SLO satisfaction rates. We show that PATCHEDSERVE can achieve 30.1 % higher SLO satisfaction compared to SOTA diffusion serving system while not hurt the image quality.</p></details> |  |

Multiple layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a broad array of layouts such as segmentation maps, edges, and human keypoints. In this work, we present ObjectDiffusion, a model that takes inspirations from the top cutting-edge image generative frameworks to seamlessly condition T2I models with new bounding boxes capabilities. Specifically, we make substantial modifications to the network architecture introduced in ContorlNet to integrate it with the condition processing and injection techniques proposed in GLIGEN. ObjectDiffusion is initialized with pretraining parameters to leverage the generation knowledge obtained from training on large-scale datasets. We fine-tune ObjectDiffusion on the COCO2017 training dataset and evaluate it on the COCO2017 validation dataset. Our model achieves an AP$_{50}$ of 46.6, an AR of 44.5, and a FID of 19.8 outperforming the current SOTA model trained on open-source datasets in all of the three metrics. ObjectDiffusion demonstrates a distinctive capability in synthesizing diverse, high-quality, high-fidelity images that seamlessly conform to the semantic and spatial control layout. Evaluated in qualitative and quantitative tests, ObjectDiffusion exhibits remarkable grounding abilities on closed-set and open-set settings across a wide variety of contexts. The qualitative assessment verifies the ability of ObjectDiffusion to generate multiple objects of different sizes and locations.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+21 ...</summary><p>9+21 pages, 4+11 figures.

While generative AI models like text-to-image can alleviate data scarcity, incorporating spatial annotations, such as segmentation masks, is crucial for precision-driven surgical applications, simulation, and education. This study introduces both a novel task and method, SimGen, for Simultaneous Image and Mask Generation. SimGen is a diffusion model based on the DDPM framework and Residual U-Net, designed to jointly generate high-fidelity surgical images and their corresponding segmentation masks. The model leverages cross-correlation priors to capture dependencies between continuous image and discrete mask distributions. Additionally, a Canonical Fibonacci Lattice (CFL) is employed to enhance class separability and uniformity in the RGB space of the masks. SimGen delivers high-fidelity images and accurate segmentation masks, outperforming baselines across six public datasets assessed on image and semantic inception distance metrics. Ablation study shows that the CFL improves mask quality and spatial separation. Downstream experiments suggest generated image-mask pairs are usable if regulations limit human data release for research. This work offers a cost-effective solution for generating paired surgical images and complex labels, advancing surgical AI development by reducing the need for expensive manual annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/</p></details> |

However, recent research has primarily focused on scaling up model training, while offering limited insights into the direct impact of representations on the video generation process. In this paper, we initially investigate the characteristics of features in intermediate layers, finding substantial variations in attention maps across different layers. These variations lead to unstable semantic representations and contribute to cumulative differences between features, which ultimately reduce the similarity between adjacent frames and negatively affect temporal coherence. To address this, we propose RepVideo, an enhanced representation framework for text-to-video diffusion models. By accumulating features from neighboring layers to form enriched representations, this approach captures more stable semantic information. These enhanced representations are then used as inputs to the attention mechanism, thereby improving semantic expressiveness while ensuring feature consistency across adjacent frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RepVideo not only significantly enhances the ability to generate accurate spatial appearances, such as capturing complex spatial relationships between multiple objects, but also improves temporal consistency in video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vchitect.github.io/RepVid-Webpage</p></details> |

However, directly applying these models to the fashion domain may encounter two issues: (1) Inaccurate localization of editing region; (2) Weak editing magnitude. To address these issues, the MADiff model is proposed. Specifically, to more accurately identify editing region, the MaskNet is proposed, in which the foreground region, densepose and mask prompts from large language model are fed into a lightweight UNet to predict the mask for editing region. To strengthen the editing magnitude, the Attention-Enhanced Diffusion Model is proposed, where the noise map, attention map, and the mask from MaskNet are fed into the proposed Attention Processor to produce a refined noise map. By integrating the refined noise map into the diffusion model, the edited image can better align with the target prompt. Given the absence of benchmarks in fashion image editing, we constructed a dataset named Fashion-E, comprising 28390 image-text pairs in the training set, and 2639 image-text pairs for four types of fashion tasks in the evaluation set. Extensive experiments on Fashion-E demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately predict the mask of editing region and significantly enhance editing magnitude in fashion image editing compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods rely on known degradation kernels, making them difficult to apply to blind SR. To address these issues, we introduce degradation-aware models that can be integrated into the diffusion guidance framework, eliminating the need to know degradation kernels.

Inspired by the input format for the inpainting task proposed by FLUX.1-Fill-dev, we improve the Long-context Condition Unit (LCU) introduced in ACE and extend this input paradigm to any editing and generation tasks. To take full advantage of image generative priors, we develop a two-stage training scheme to minimize the efforts of finetuning powerful text-to-image diffusion models like FLUX.1-dev. In the first stage, we pre-train the model using task data with the 0-ref tasks from the text-to-image model. There are many models in the community based on the post-training of text-to-image foundational models that meet this training paradigm of the first stage. For example, FLUX.1-Fill-dev deals primarily with painting tasks and can be used as an initialization to accelerate the training process. In the second stage, we finetune the above model to support the general instructions using all tasks defined in ACE. To promote the widespread application of ACE++ in different scenarios, we provide a comprehensive set of models that cover both full finetuning and lightweight finetuning, while considering general applicability and applicability in vertical scenarios. The qualitative analysis showcases the superiority of ACE++ in terms of generating image quality and prompt following ability.

Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art solution for generating in-silico images, offering unparalleled fidelity and realism. Using appearance transfer diffusion models allows for zero-shot image generation, facilitating fast application and making model training unnecessary. However current appearance transfer diffusion models are designed for natural images, where the main task is to transfer the foreground object from an origin to a target domain, while the background is of insignificant importance. In computational pathology, specifically in oncology, it is however not straightforward to define which objects in an image should be classified as foreground and background, as all objects in an image may be of critical importance for the detailed understanding the tumor micro-environment. We contribute to the applicability of appearance transfer diffusion models to immunohistochemistry-stained images by modifying the appearance transfer guidance to alternate between class-specific AdaIN feature statistics matchings using existing segmentation masks. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on the downstream task of supervised epithelium segmentation, showing that the number of manual annotations required for model training can be reduced by 75%, outperforming the baseline approach. Additionally, we consulted with a certified pathologist to investigate future improvements. We anticipate this work to inspire the application of zero-shot diffusion models in computational pathology, providing an efficient method to generate in-silico images with unmatched fidelity and realism, which prove meaningful for downstream tasks, such as training existing deep learning models or finetuning foundation models.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for addressing fairness have failed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for distribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG, it is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as a novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue. Specifically, we first pre-train a score-based diffusion model (SDM) and two classifiers to equip the model with strong generalization capabilities across different domains. Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to effectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally, the generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring robust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also improves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts. Additionally, FADE outperforms existing methods in achieving the best accuracy-fairness trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

First, the diffusion model is pre-trained on clean speech conditioned on corresponding video data to simulate the speech generative distribution. This pre-trained model is then paired with the NMF-based noise model to estimate clean speech iteratively. Specifically, a diffusion-based posterior sampling approach is implemented within the reverse diffusion process, where after each iteration, a speech estimate is obtained and used to update the noise parameters. Experimental results confirm that the proposed AVSE approach not only outperforms its audio-only counterpart but also generalizes better than a recent supervised-generative AVSE method. Additionally, the new inference algorithm offers a better balance between inference speed and performance compared to the previous diffusion-based method.

Existing methods, such as AniClipart, effectively model spatial deformations but often fail to ensure smooth temporal transitions, resulting in artifacts like abrupt motions and geometric distortions. Similarly, text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models struggle to handle clipart due to the mismatch in statistical properties between natural video and clipart styles. This paper introduces FlexiClip, a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by addressing the intertwined challenges of temporal consistency and geometric integrity. FlexiClip extends traditional B\'ezier curve-based trajectory modeling with key innovations: temporal Jacobians to correct motion dynamics incrementally, continuous-time modeling via probability flow ODEs (pfODEs) to mitigate temporal noise, and a flow matching loss inspired by GFlowNet principles to optimize smooth motion transitions. These enhancements ensure coherent animations across complex scenarios involving rapid movements and non-rigid deformations. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FlexiClip in generating animations that are not only smooth and natural but also structurally consistent across diverse clipart types, including humans and animals. By integrating spatial and temporal modeling with pre-trained video diffusion models, FlexiClip sets a new standard for high-quality clipart animation, offering robust performance across a wide range of visual content.

Longitudinal brain MRI registration, a cornerstone for such analyses, has long been limited by its inability to forecast future developments, reliance on extensive, dense longitudinal data, and the need to balance registration accuracy with temporal smoothness. In this work, we present \emph{TimeFlow}, a novel framework for longitudinal brain MRI registration that overcomes all these challenges. Leveraging a U-Net architecture with temporal conditioning inspired by diffusion models, TimeFlow enables accurate longitudinal registration and facilitates prospective analyses through future image prediction. Unlike traditional methods that depend on explicit smoothness regularizers and dense sequential data, TimeFlow achieves temporal consistency and continuity without these constraints. Experimental results highlight its superior performance in both future timepoint prediction and registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, TimeFlow supports novel biological brain aging analyses, effectively differentiating neurodegenerative conditions from healthy aging. It eliminates the need for segmentation, thereby avoiding the challenges of non-trivial annotation and inconsistent segmentation errors. TimeFlow paves the way for accurate, data-efficient, and annotation-free prospective analyses of brain aging and chronic diseases.</p></details> |  |

However, the employed networks typically are black-box estimators of the (smoothed) prior score with tens of millions of parameters, restricting interpretability and increasing reconstruction time. Furthermore, parallel imaging reconstruction algorithms either rely on off-line coil sensitivity estimation, which is prone to misalignment and restricting sampling trajectories, or perform per-coil reconstruction, making the computational cost proportional to the number of coils. To overcome this, we jointly reconstruct the image and the coil sensitivities using the lightweight, parameter-efficient, and interpretable product of Gaussian mixture diffusion model as an image prior and a classical smoothness priors on the coil sensitivities. The proposed method delivers promising results while allowing for fast inference and demonstrating robustness to contrast out-of-distribution data and sampling trajectories, comparable to classical variational penalties such as total variation.

Recently, generative diffusion models (GDMs) have emerged as a promising new approach to network optimization, with the potential to directly address these optimization problems. However, the application of GDMs in this field is still in its early stages, and there is a noticeable lack of theoretical research and empirical findings. In this study, we first explore the intrinsic characteristics of generative models. Next, we provide a concise theoretical proof and intuitive demonstration of the advantages of generative models over discriminative models in network optimization. Based on this exploration, we implement GDMs as optimizers aimed at learning high-quality solution distributions for given inputs, sampling from these distributions during inference to approximate or achieve optimal solutions. Specifically, we utilize denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and employ a classifier-free guidance mechanism to manage conditional guidance based on input parameters. We conduct extensive experiments across three challenging network optimization problems. By investigating various model configurations and the principles of GDMs as optimizers, we demonstrate the ability to overcome prediction errors and validate the convergence of generated solutions to optimal solutions.

While reward models (RMs) with reinforcement learning or test-time scaling offer the potential for improving generation quality, a critical gap remains: publicly available multi-modal RMs for LVLMs are scarce, and the implementation details of proprietary models are often unclear. We bridge this gap with InternLM-XComposer2.5-Reward (IXC-2.5-Reward), a simple yet effective multi-modal reward model that aligns LVLMs with human preferences. To ensure the robustness and versatility of IXC-2.5-Reward, we set up a high-quality multi-modal preference corpus spanning text, image, and video inputs across diverse domains, such as instruction following, general understanding, text-rich documents, mathematical reasoning, and video understanding. IXC-2.5-Reward achieves excellent results on the latest multi-modal reward model benchmark and shows competitive performance on text-only reward model benchmarks. We further demonstrate three key applications of IXC-2.5-Reward: (1) Providing a supervisory signal for RL training. We integrate IXC-2.5-Reward with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) yields IXC-2.5-Chat, which shows consistent improvements in instruction following and multi-modal open-ended dialogue; (2) Selecting the best response from candidate responses for test-time scaling; and (3) Filtering outlier or noisy samples from existing image and video instruction tuning training data.

However, the manual generation of unstructured medical reports is time consuming and prone to errors. It creates a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Despite advancements in AI-generated radiology reports, challenges remain in achieving detailed and accurate report generation. In this study we have evaluated different combinations of multimodal models that integrate Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to generate comprehensive radiology reports. We employed a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) and a SWIN Transformer as the image encoders. The BART and GPT-2 models serve as the textual decoders. We used Chest X-ray images and reports from the IU-Xray dataset to evaluate the usability of the SWIN Transformer-BART, SWIN Transformer-GPT-2, ViT-B16-BART and ViT-B16-GPT-2 models for report generation. We aimed at finding the best combination among the models. The SWIN-BART model performs as the best-performing model among the four models achieving remarkable results in almost all the evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU and BERTScore.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, manuscript under-review</p></details> |

This paper aims to address the problems of societal bias in CLIP. Although previous studies have proposed to debias societal bias through adversarial learning or test-time projecting, our comprehensive study of these works identifies two critical limitations: 1) loss of attribute information when it is explicitly disclosed in the input and 2) use of the attribute annotations during debiasing process. To mitigate societal bias in CLIP and overcome these limitations simultaneously, we introduce a simple-yet-effective debiasing method called SANER (societal attribute neutralizer) that eliminates attribute information from CLIP text features only of attribute-neutral descriptions. Experimental results show that SANER, which does not require attribute annotations and preserves original information for attribute-specific descriptions, demonstrates superior debiasing ability than the existing methods. Additionally, we observe that SANER does not require retraining CLIP from scratch with the original dataset. Moreover, the debiased model can be directly applied to the text-to-image generation model by simply replacing the text encoder.</p></details> |  |

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

However, these models frequently exhibit hallucination behavior, where they generate descriptions containing objects or details absent in the input image. Our work investigates this phenomenon by analyzing attention patterns across transformer layers and heads, revealing that hallucinations often stem from progressive degradation of visual grounding in deeper layers. We propose a novel attention modification approach that combines selective token emphasis and head-specific modulation to maintain visual grounding throughout the generation process. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a dual-stream token selection mechanism that identifies and prioritizes both locally informative and spatially significant visual tokens, and (2) an attention head-specific modulation strategy that differentially amplifies visual information processing based on measured visual sensitivity of individual attention heads. Through extensive experimentation on the MSCOCO dataset, we demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining comparable task performance. Our analysis reveals that selectively modulating tokens across attention heads with varying levels of visual sensitivity can significantly improve visual grounding without requiring model retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Multiple heads intuitively enable different parallel processes over the same input. Yet, they also obscure the attribution of each input patch to the output of a model. We propose a novel 1-head Transformer Attention Bottleneck (TAB) layer, inserted after the traditional MHSA architecture, to serve as an attention bottleneck for interpretability and intervention. Unlike standard self-attention, TAB constrains the total attention over all patches to $\in [0, 1]$. That is, when the total attention is 0, no visual information is propagated further into the network and the vision-language model (VLM) would default to a generic, image-independent response. To demonstrate the advantages of TAB, we train VLMs with TAB to perform image difference captioning. Over three datasets, our models perform similarly to baseline VLMs in captioning but the bottleneck is superior in localizing changes and in identifying when no changes occur. TAB is the first architecture to enable users to intervene by editing attention, which often produces expected outputs by VLMs.</p></details> |  |

The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.</p></details> |  |

While advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer the potential to assist human testers, the effectiveness of AI in truly enhancing real-world human performance remains underexplored. This study investigates how AI can improve game testing by developing and experimenting with an AI-assisted workflow that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models for defect detection. Through an experiment involving 800 test cases and 276 participants of varying backgrounds, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI assistance under four conditions: with or without AI support, and with or without detailed knowledge of defects and design documentation. The results indicate that AI assistance significantly improves defect identification performance, particularly when paired with detailed knowledge. However, challenges arise when AI errors occur, negatively impacting human decision-making. Our findings show the importance of optimizing human-AI collaboration and implementing strategies to mitigate the effects of AI inaccuracies. By this research, we demonstrate AI's potential and problems in enhancing efficiency and accuracy in game testing workflows and offers practical insights for integrating AI into the testing process.</p></details> | Experiment Report |

Existing methods often leverage language information from vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance OOD detection by improving confidence estimation through rich class-wise text information. However, when building OOD detection score upon on in-distribution (ID) text-image affinity, existing works either focus on each ID class or whole ID label sets, overlooking inherent ID classes' connection. We find that the semantic information across different ID classes is beneficial for effective OOD detection. We thus investigate the ability of image-text comprehension among different semantic-related ID labels in VLMs and propose a novel post-hoc strategy called SimLabel. SimLabel enhances the separability between ID and OOD samples by establishing a more robust image-class similarity metric that considers consistency over a set of similar class labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SimLabel on various zero-shot OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model is also extended to various VLM-backbones, demonstrating its good generalization ability.

The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in particular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to detect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context disinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document, neglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that are not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task of validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency~(LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news articles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting strategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images crawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of entity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results show the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification, showing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence images. Moreover, our method outperforms a baseline for location and event verification in documents.

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on the ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

However, applying the CLIP inference in zero-shot classification, particularly for medical image diagnosis, faces challenges due to: 1) the inadequacy of representing image classes solely with single category names; 2) the modal gap between the visual and text spaces generated by CLIP encoders. Despite attempts to enrich disease descriptions with large language models, the lack of class-specific knowledge often leads to poor performance. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that existing proxy learning methods for zero-shot image classification on natural image datasets exhibit instability when applied to medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Knowledge Proxy Learning (KPL) to mine knowledge from CLIP. KPL is designed to leverage CLIP's multimodal understandings for medical image classification through Text Proxy Optimization and Multimodal Proxy Learning. Specifically, KPL retrieves image-relevant knowledge descriptions from the constructed knowledge-enhanced base to enrich semantic text proxies. It then harnesses input images and these descriptions, encoded via CLIP, to stably generate multimodal proxies that boost the zero-shot classification performance. Extensive experiments conducted on both medical and natural image datasets demonstrate that KPL enables effective zero-shot image classification, outperforming all baselines. These findings highlight the great potential in this paradigm of mining knowledge from CLIP for medical image classification and broader areas.</p></details> | AAAI(Oral) |

Models such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, and LLama can use images to understand and analyze complex visual scenes. 3D objects and shapes are the basic building blocks of the world, recognizing them is a fundamental part of human perception. The goal of this work is to test whether LVLMs truly understand 3D shapes by testing the models ability to identify and match objects of the exact same 3D shapes but with different orientations and materials/textures. A large number of test images were created using CGI with a huge number of highly diverse objects, materials, and scenes. The results of this test show that the ability of such models to match 3D shapes is significantly below humans but much higher than random guesses. Suggesting that the models have gained some abstract understanding of 3D shapes but still trail far beyond humans in this task. Mainly it seems that the models can easily identify the same object with a different orientation as well as matching identical 3D shapes of the same orientation but with different materials and textures. However, when both the object material and orientation are changed, all models perform poorly relative to humans. Code and benchmark are available.</p></details> |  |

To enhance CLIP's effectiveness and versatility, efficient few-shot adaptation techniques have been widely adopted. Among these approaches, training-free methods, particularly caching methods exemplified by Tip-Adapter, have gained attention for their lightweight adaptation without the need for additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we revisit Tip-Adapter from a kernel perspective, showing that caching methods function as local adapters and are connected to a well-established kernel literature. Drawing on this insight, we offer a theoretical understanding of how these methods operate and suggest multiple avenues for enhancing the Tip-Adapter baseline. Notably, our analysis shows the importance of incorporating global information in local adapters. Therefore, we subsequently propose a global method that learns a proximal regularizer in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) using CLIP as a base learner. Our method, which we call ProKeR (Proximal Kernel ridge Regression), has a closed form solution and achieves state-of-the-art performances across 11 datasets in the standard few-shot adaptation benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://ybendou.github.io/ProKeR</p></details> |

Despite this advancement, the safety of LVLMs remains adequately underexplored, with a potential overreliance on the safety assurances purported by their underlying LLMs. In this paper, we propose FigStep, a straightforward yet effective black-box jailbreak algorithm against LVLMs. Instead of feeding textual harmful instructions directly, FigStep converts the prohibited content into images through typography to bypass the safety alignment. The experimental results indicate that FigStep can achieve an average attack success rate of 82.50% on six promising open-source LVLMs. Not merely to demonstrate the efficacy of FigStep, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies and analyze the distribution of the semantic embeddings to uncover that the reason behind the success of FigStep is the deficiency of safety alignment for visual embeddings. Moreover, we compare FigStep with five text-only jailbreaks and four image-based jailbreaks to demonstrate the superiority of FigStep, i.e., negligible attack costs and better attack performance. Above all, our work reveals that current LVLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which highlights the necessity of novel cross-modality safety alignment techniques.

In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens.

Additionally, providing a graphical representation can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies for transferring learning capabilities from LLMs to Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks.

However, the excessive computational complexity limits the widespread use of these models in practical applications. We argue that one main bottleneck in computational complexity is caused by the involvement of redundant vision sequences in model computation. This is inspired by a reassessment of the efficiency of vision and language information transmission in the language decoder of LVLMs. Then, we propose a novel hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism called Hierarchical Vision injection for Mixture Attention (HiMix). In HiMix, only the language sequence undergoes full forward propagation, while the vision sequence interacts with the language at specific stages within each language decoder layer. It is striking that our approach significantly reduces computational complexity with minimal performance loss. Specifically, HiMix achieves a 10x reduction in the computational cost of the language decoder across multiple LVLM models while maintaining comparable performance.

Extensive experiments show that Tarsier2-7B consistently outperforms leading proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, in detailed video description tasks. On the DREAM-1K benchmark, Tarsier2-7B improves F1 by 2.8\% over GPT-4o and 5.8\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. In human side-by-side evaluations, Tarsier2-7B shows a +8.6\% performance advantage over GPT-4o and +24.9\% over Gemini-1.5-Pro. Tarsier2-7B also sets new state-of-the-art results across 15 public benchmarks, spanning tasks such as video question-answering, video grounding, hallucination test, and embodied question-answering, demonstrating its versatility as a robust generalist vision-language model.</p></details> |  |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing methods mostly seek a direct mapping function from visual data to the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which is contradictory to the mechanism of practical subjective evaluation. To address this, we propose a novel language-driven PCQA method named CLIP-PCQA. Considering that human beings prefer to describe visual quality using discrete quality descriptions (e.g., "excellent" and "poor") rather than specific scores, we adopt a retrieval-based mapping strategy to simulate the process of subjective assessment. More specifically, based on the philosophy of CLIP, we calculate the cosine similarity between the visual features and multiple textual features corresponding to different quality descriptions, in which process an effective contrastive loss and learnable prompts are introduced to enhance the feature extraction. Meanwhile, given the personal limitations and bias in subjective experiments, we further covert the feature similarities into probabilities and consider the Opinion Score Distribution (OSD) rather than a single MOS as the final target. Experimental results show that our CLIP-PCQA outperforms other State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches.</p></details> |  |

Without proper safeguards, however, VLMs may give harmful advice (e.g. how to self-harm) or encourage unsafe behaviours (e.g. to consume drugs). Despite these clear hazards, little work so far has evaluated VLM safety and the novel risks created by multimodal inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MSTS, a Multimodal Safety Test Suite for VLMs. MSTS comprises 400 test prompts across 40 fine-grained hazard categories. Each test prompt consists of a text and an image that only in combination reveal their full unsafe meaning. With MSTS, we find clear safety issues in several open VLMs. We also find some VLMs to be safe by accident, meaning that they are safe because they fail to understand even simple test prompts. We translate MSTS into ten languages, showing non-English prompts to increase the rate of unsafe model responses. We also show models to be safer when tested with text only rather than multimodal prompts. Finally, we explore the automation of VLM safety assessments, finding even the best safety classifiers to be lacking.</p></details> | under review |

Leveraging significant advancements in 3D generation from a single image, this paper proposes a novel method to mitigate HoOA in LVLMs. This method utilizes multiview images sampled from generated 3D representations as visual prompts for LVLMs, thereby providing more visual information from other viewpoints. Furthermore, we observe the input order of multiple multiview images significantly affects the performance of LVLMs. Consequently, we have devised Multiview Image Augmented VLM (MIAVLM), incorporating a Multiview Attributes Perceiver (MAP) submodule capable of simultaneously eliminating the influence of input image order and aligning visual information from multiview images with Large Language Models (LLMs). Besides, we designed and employed negative instructions to mitigate LVLMs' bias towards ``Yes" responses.

However, current LVLMs primarily rely on visual features extracted from the final layers of the vision encoder, overlooking the complementary information available in shallower layers. While recent approaches have explored the use of multilayer visual features in LVLMs, they tend to be task-agnostic and fail to examine the dependencies of hierarchical visual features on specific tasks. To address these gaps, we systematically investigate the contributions of visual features from different encoder layers using 18 benchmarks spanning 6 task categories. Our findings reveal that multilayer features provide complementary strengths with varying task dependencies, and uniform fusion leads to suboptimal performance. Building on these insights, we propose the instruction-guided vision aggregator, a module that dynamically integrates multi-layer visual features based on textual instructions, without increasing the number of visual tokens. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of the aggregator's behavior highlights the dominance of mid-to-high-level features in semantic-rich tasks and the critical role of low-level features in fine-grained perception.</p></details> |  |

However, the decision logic of these frameworks is often not transparent, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand, interpret or explain their behavior. This limitation hinders trust in machine learning systems and causes a general reluctance towards their adoption in practical applications, particularly in mission-critical domains like healthcare and autonomous driving. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques facilitate the explainability or interpretability of machine learning models, enabling users to discern the basis of the decision and possibly avert undesirable behavior. This comprehensive survey details the advancements of explainable AI methods, from inherently interpretable models to modern approaches for achieving interpretability of various black box models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we review explainable AI techniques that leverage LLM and vision-language model (VLM) frameworks to automate or improve the explainability of other machine learning models. The use of LLM and VLM as interpretability methods particularly enables high-level, semantically meaningful explanations of model decisions and behavior. Throughout the paper, we highlight the scientific principles, strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art methods and outline different areas of improvement. Where appropriate, we also present qualitative and quantitative comparison results of various methods to show how they compare. Finally, we discuss the key challenges of XAI and directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that false positive rewards -- instances where unintended trajectories are incorrectly rewarded -- are more detrimental than false negatives. Our analysis confirms this hypothesis, revealing that the widely used cosine similarity metric is prone to false positive reward estimates. To address this, we introduce BiMI ({Bi}nary {M}utual {I}nformation), a novel reward function designed to mitigate noise. BiMI significantly enhances learning efficiency across diverse and challenging embodied navigation environments.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention as a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from constructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in responses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data construction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We identify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the constructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO. Theoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by the presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference policy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically summarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address hallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment (OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct hallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised responses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO achieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B: 13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared to the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been effective in zero-shot tasks by leveraging their general knowledge from large-scale datasets. Recent studies demonstrate that transformer-based models with class-wise queries can effectively address zero-shot multi-label classification. However, poor utilization of the relationship between seen and unseen attributes makes the model lack generalizability. Additionally, attribute classification generally involves many attributes, making maintaining the model's scalability difficult. To address these issues, we propose Super-class guided transFormer (SugaFormer), a novel framework that leverages super-classes to enhance scalability and generalizability for zero-shot attribute classification. SugaFormer employs Super-class Query Initialization (SQI) to reduce the number of queries, utilizing common semantic information from super-classes, and incorporates Multi-context Decoding (MD) to handle diverse visual cues. To strengthen generalizability, we introduce two knowledge transfer strategies that utilize VLMs. During training, Super-class guided Consistency Regularization (SCR) aligns model's features with VLMs using super-class guided prompts, and during inference, Zero-shot Retrieval-based Score Enhancement (ZRSE) refines predictions for unseen attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SugaFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three widely-used attribute classification benchmarks under zero-shot, and cross-dataset transfer settings.

While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations. We hope this work can be the starting point to shed new light on how to apply VLMs for autonomous driving.

Unlike previous approaches that resort to lightweight adversarial fine-tuning of a pre-trained CLIP model, we perform large-scale adversarial vision-language pre-training from scratch using web-scale data. We then strengthen the defense by incorporating adversarial visual instruction tuning. The resulting models from each stage, $\Delta$CLIP and $\Delta^2$LLaVA, show substantially enhanced zero-shot robustness and set a new state-of-the-art in adversarial defense for vision-language models. For example, the adversarial robustness of $\Delta$CLIP surpasses that of the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20%. %For example, $\Delta$CLIP surpasses the previous best models on ImageNet-1k by ~20% in terms of adversarial robustness. Similarly, compared to prior art, $\Delta^2$LLaVA brings a ~30% robustness improvement to image captioning task and a ~20% robustness improvement to visual question answering task. Furthermore, our models exhibit stronger zero-shot recognition capability, fewer hallucinations, and superior reasoning performance compared to baselines.

Despite advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) through large-scale training, their ability to comprehend negation remains underexplored. This study addresses the question: how well do current VLMs understand negation? We introduce NegBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate negation understanding across 18 task variations and 79k examples spanning image, video, and medical datasets. The benchmark consists of two core tasks designed to evaluate negation understanding in diverse multimodal settings: Retrieval with Negation and Multiple Choice Questions with Negated Captions. Our evaluation reveals that modern VLMs struggle significantly with negation, often performing at chance level. To address these shortcomings, we explore a data-centric approach wherein we finetune CLIP models on large-scale synthetic datasets containing millions of negated captions. We show that this approach can result in a 10% increase in recall on negated queries and a 40% boost in accuracy on multiple-choice questions with negated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://negbench.github.io</p></details> |

Augmented Reality (AR) head worn devices can uniquely improve the user experience of solving procedural day-to-day tasks by providing egocentric multimodal (audio and video) observational capabilities to AI Agents. Such AR capabilities can help AI Agents see and listen to actions that users take which can relate to multimodal capabilities of human users. Existing AI Agents, either Large Language Models (LLMs) or Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reactive in nature, which means that models cannot take an action without reading or listening to the human user's prompts. Proactivity of AI Agents on the other hand can help the human user detect and correct any mistakes in agent observed tasks, encourage users when they do tasks correctly or simply engage in conversation with the user - akin to a human teaching or assisting a user. Our proposed YET to Intervene (YETI) multimodal agent focuses on the research question of identifying circumstances that may require the agent to intervene proactively. This allows the agent to understand when it can intervene in a conversation with human users that can help the user correct mistakes on tasks, like cooking, using AR. Our YETI Agent learns scene understanding signals based on interpretable notions of Structural Similarity (SSIM) on consecutive video frames. We also define the alignment signal which the AI Agent can learn to identify if the video frames corresponding to the user's actions on the task are consistent with expected actions. These signals are used by our AI Agent to determine when it should proactively intervene. We compare our results on the instances of proactive intervention in the HoloAssist multimodal benchmark for an expert agent guiding a user to complete procedural tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recent works proposed to utilize Large Language Models and pre-trained Vision-Language Models to automate the training of CBMs, making it more scalable and automated. However, existing approaches still fall short in two aspects: First, the concepts predicted by CBL often mismatch the input image, raising doubts about the faithfulness of interpretation. Second, it has been shown that concept values encode unintended information: even a set of random concepts could achieve comparable test accuracy to state-of-the-art CBMs. To address these critical limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework called Vision-Language-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (VLG-CBM) to enable faithful interpretability with the benefits of boosted performance. Our method leverages off-the-shelf open-domain grounded object detectors to provide visually grounded concept annotation, which largely enhances the faithfulness of concept prediction while further improving the model performance. In addition, we propose a new metric called Number of Effective Concepts (NEC) to control the information leakage and provide better interpretability. Extensive evaluations across five standard benchmarks show that our method, VLG-CBM, outperforms existing methods by at least 4.27% and up to 51.09% on Accuracy at NEC=5 (denoted as ANEC-5), and by at least 0.45% and up to 29.78% on average accuracy (denoted as ANEC-avg), while preserving both faithfulness and interpretability of the learned concepts as demonstrated in extensive experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

RoboReflect allows robots to automatically adjust their strategies based on unsuccessful attempts until successful execution is achieved.The corrected strategies are saved in a memory for future task reference.We evaluate RoboReflect through extensive testing on eight common objects prone to ambiguous conditions of three categories.Our results demonstrate that RoboReflect not only outperforms existing grasp pose estimation methods like AnyGrasp and high-level action planning techniques using GPT-4V but also significantly enhances the robot's ability to adapt and correct errors independently.

However, unlike traditional web applications, HTML5 <canvas> applications render objects onto the <canvas> bitmap without representing them in the Document Object Model (DOM). Mismatches between the expected and actual visual output of the <canvas> bitmap are termed visual bugs. Due to the visual-centric nature of <canvas> applications, visual bugs are important to detect because such bugs can render a <canvas> application useless. As we showed in prior work, Asset-Based graphics can provide the ground truth for a visual test oracle. However, many <canvas> applications procedurally generate their graphics. In this paper, we investigate how to detect visual bugs in <canvas> applications that use Procedural graphics as well. In particular, we explore the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically detect visual bugs. Instead of defining an exact visual test oracle, information about the application's expected functionality (the context) can be provided with the screenshot as input to the VLM. To evaluate this approach, we constructed a dataset containing 80 bug-injected screenshots across four visual bug types (Layout, Rendering, Appearance, and State) plus 20 bug-free screenshots from 20 <canvas> applications. We ran experiments with a state-of-the-art VLM using several combinations of text and image context to describe each application's expected functionality.

This nonetheless arises while describing general concepts, e.g. all traffic lights in a city. To facilitate reasoning based on such concepts, text localization in the form of distribution is required. In this paper, we generate the distribution of the camera poses conditioned upon the textual description. To facilitate such generation, we propose a diffusion-based architecture that conditionally diffuses the noisy 6DoF camera poses to their plausible locations. The conditional signals are derived from the text descriptions, using the pre-trained text encoders. The connection between text descriptions and pose distribution is established through pretrained Vision-Language-Model, i.e. CLIP. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the candidate poses for the distribution can be further refined by rendering potential poses using 3D Gaussian splatting, guiding incorrectly posed samples towards locations that better align with the textual description, through visual reasoning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with both standard retrieval methods and learning-based approaches. Our proposed method consistently outperforms these baselines across all five large-scale datasets. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks. Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding. To this end, we compiled 38 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 101 different target conditions and 288,307 images. We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data. Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them. We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories. When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes. Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a wide margin larger-scale generalist image-language models and retina domain-specific self-supervised networks, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

Distribution shifts in defocused images generally lead to performance degradation of existing methods during out-of-distribution inferences. In this work, we gauge the intrinsic reason behind the performance degradation, which is identified as the heterogeneity of lens-specific point spread functions. Empirical evidence supports this finding, motivating us to employ a continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) paradigm for SIDD. However, traditional CTTA methods, which primarily rely on entropy minimization, cannot sufficiently explore task-dependent information for pixel-level regression tasks like SIDD. To address this issue, we propose a novel Siamese networks-based continual test-time adaptation framework, which adapts source models to continuously changing target domains only requiring unlabeled target data in an online manner. To further mitigate semantically erroneous textures introduced by source SIDD models under severe degradation, we revisit the learning paradigm through a structural causal model and propose Causal Siamese networks (CauSiam). Our method leverages large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to derive discriminative universal semantic priors and integrates these priors into Siamese networks, ensuring causal identifiability between blurry inputs and restored images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CauSiam effectively improves the generalization performance of existing SIDD methods in continuously changing domains.</p></details> |  |

However, these representations suffer from some key shortcomings in understanding Compositional Language Concepts (CLC), such as recognizing objects' attributes, states, and relations between different objects. Moreover, VLMs typically have poor interpretability, making it challenging to debug and mitigate compositional-understanding failures. In this work, we introduce the architecture and training technique of Tree-augmented Vision-Language (3VL) model accompanied by our proposed Anchor inference method and Differential Relevance (DiRe) interpretability tool. By expanding the text of an arbitrary image-text pair into a hierarchical tree structure using language analysis tools, 3VL allows the induction of this structure into the visual representation learned by the model, enhancing its interpretability and compositional reasoning. Additionally, we show how Anchor, a simple technique for text unification, can be used to filter nuisance factors while increasing CLC understanding performance, e.g., on the fundamental VL-Checklist benchmark. We also show how DiRe, which performs a differential comparison between VLM relevancy maps, enables us to generate compelling visualizations of the reasons for a model's success or failure.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, Adaptive Knowledge-Guided Pretraining for Large Vision-Language Models (AKGP-LVLM), which dynamically incorporates structured and unstructured knowledge into LVLMs during pretraining and fine-tuning. Our approach employs a knowledge encoder to represent external knowledge, a retrieval mechanism to select task-relevant information, and a dynamic adaptor to align multimodal and knowledge representations effectively. We evaluate our method on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, human evaluations highlight the superior correctness and relevance of our model's outputs. Extensive analyses confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of AKGP-LVLM, making it a compelling solution for real-world knowledge-intensive tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite their innovative potential, LVLMs exhibit vulnerabilities, especially in generating potentially toxic or unsafe responses. Malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to propagate toxic content in an automated (or semi-) manner, leveraging the susceptibility of LVLMs to deception via strategically crafted prompts without fine-tuning or compute-intensive procedures. Despite the red-teaming efforts and inherent potential risks associated with the LVLMs, exploring vulnerabilities of LVLMs remains nascent and yet to be fully addressed in a systematic manner. This study systematically examines the vulnerabilities of open-source LVLMs, including LLaVA, InstructBLIP, Fuyu, and Qwen, using adversarial prompt strategies that simulate real-world social manipulation tactics informed by social theories. Our findings show that (i) toxicity and insulting are the most prevalent behaviors, with the mean rates of 16.13% and 9.75%, respectively; (ii) Qwen-VL-Chat, LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-7b, and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7b are the most vulnerable models, exhibiting toxic response rates of 21.50%, 18.30% and 17.90%, and insulting responses of 13.40%, 11.70% and 10.10%, respectively; (iii) prompting strategies incorporating dark humor and multimodal toxic prompt completion significantly elevated these vulnerabilities. Despite being fine-tuned for safety, these models still generate content with varying degrees of toxicity when prompted with adversarial inputs, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms and robust guardrails in LVLM development.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional systems, which rely on a limited set of predefined gestures, GestLLM leverages large language models and feature extraction via MediaPipe to interpret a diverse range of gestures. This integration addresses key limitations in existing systems, such as restricted gesture flexibility and the inability to recognize complex or unconventional gestures commonly used in human communication. By combining state-of-the-art feature extraction and language model capabilities, GestLLM achieves performance comparable to leading vision-language models while supporting gestures underrepresented in traditional datasets. For example, this includes gestures from popular culture, such as the ``Vulcan salute" from Star Trek, without any additional pretraining, prompt engineering, etc. This flexibility enhances the naturalness and inclusivity of robot control, making interactions more intuitive and user-friendly. GestLLM provides a significant step forward in gesture-based interaction, enabling robots to understand and respond to a wide variety of hand gestures effectively. This paper outlines its design, implementation, and evaluation, demonstrating its potential applications in advanced human-robot collaboration, assistive robotics, and interactive entertainment.</p></details> |  |

The core lies in lightning attention and its efficient scaling. To maximize computational capacity, we integrate it with Mixture of Experts (MoE), creating a model with 32 experts and 456 billion total parameters, of which 45.9 billion are activated for each token. We develop an optimized parallel strategy and highly efficient computation-communication overlap techniques for MoE and lightning attention. This approach enables us to conduct efficient training and inference on models with hundreds of billions of parameters across contexts spanning millions of tokens. The context window of MiniMax-Text-01 can reach up to 1 million tokens during training and extrapolate to 4 million tokens during inference at an affordable cost. Our vision-language model, MiniMax-VL-01 is built through continued training with 512 billion vision-language tokens. Experiments on both standard and in-house benchmarks show that our models match the performance of state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering 20-32 times longer context window.

However, progress toward generalist biomedical VLMs is limited by the lack of annotated, publicly accessible datasets across biology and medicine. Existing efforts are restricted to narrow domains, missing the full diversity of biomedical knowledge encoded in scientific literature. To address this gap, we introduce BIOMEDICA, a scalable, open-source framework to extract, annotate, and serialize the entirety of the PubMed Central Open Access subset into an easy-to-use, publicly accessible dataset. Our framework produces a comprehensive archive with over 24 million unique image-text pairs from over 6 million articles. Metadata and expert-guided annotations are also provided. We demonstrate the utility and accessibility of our resource by releasing BMCA-CLIP, a suite of CLIP-style models continuously pre-trained on the BIOMEDICA dataset via streaming, eliminating the need to download 27 TB of data locally. On average, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across 40 tasks - spanning pathology, radiology, ophthalmology, dermatology, surgery, molecular biology, parasitology, and cell biology - excelling in zero-shot classification with a 6.56% average improvement (as high as 29.8% and 17.5% in dermatology and ophthalmology, respectively), and stronger image-text retrieval, all while using 10x less compute. To foster reproducibility and collaboration, we release our codebase and dataset for the broader research community.</p></details> |  |

In the software context, we employ VLMs within the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) simulation environment, enabling the agent to interpret visual screenshots of the graphical user interface to perform complex orbital maneuvers. In the hardware context, we integrate VLMs with robotic systems equipped with cameras to inspect and diagnose physical space objects, such as satellites.

However, existing studies mainly focus on single-modal prompts or uni-directional modality interaction, overlooking the powerful alignment effects resulting from the interaction between the vision and language modalities. To this end, we propose a novel prompt learning method called $\underline{\textbf{B}}i-directional \underline{\textbf{M}}odality \underline{\textbf{I}}nteraction \underline{\textbf{P}}rompt (BMIP)$, which dynamically weights bi-modal information through learning the information of the attention layer, enhancing trainability and inter-modal consistency compared to simple information aggregation methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of prompt learning methods, we propose a more realistic evaluation paradigm called open-world generalization complementing the widely adopted cross-dataset transfer and domain generalization tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets reveal that BMIP not only outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across all three evaluation paradigms but is also flexible enough to be combined with other prompt-based methods for consistent performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned "for free" would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. "spiky" as opposed to "spiky durian"), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects.

However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we present ExACT, an approach to combine test-time search and self-learning to build o1-like models for agentic applications. We first introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test time algorithm designed to enhance AI agents' ability to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate for reliable state evaluation. Next, we introduce Exploratory Learning, a novel learning strategy to teach agents to search at inference time without relying on any external search algorithms. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge and experience gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. After Exploratory Learning, GPT-4o 1) demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success, and 2) matches 87% of R-MCTS's performance while using significantly less compute. Notably, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

As SCEs are rare events, most general vision-language models (VLMs) have not been trained sufficiently to link SCE videos and narratives, which could lead to hallucinations and missing key safety characteristics. Here, we introduce ScVLM, a novel hybrid methodology that integrates supervised and contrastive learning techniques to classify the severity and types of SCEs, as well as to generate narrative descriptions of SCEs. This approach utilizes classification to enhance VLMs' comprehension of driving videos and improve the rationality of event descriptions. The proposed approach is trained on and evaluated by more than 8,600 SCEs from the Second Strategic Highway Research Program Naturalistic Driving Study dataset, the largest publicly accessible driving dataset with videos and SCE annotations. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in generating contextually accurate event descriptions and mitigating VLM hallucinations.

In extreme use cases, such as military applications, these factors are often challenged due to the presence of unknown terrains, environmental conditions, and novel object categories. Current object detectors, including open-world detectors, lack the ability to confidently recognize novel objects or operate in unknown environments, as they have not been exposed to these new conditions. However, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit emergent properties that enable them to recognize objects in varying conditions in a zero-shot manner. Despite this, LVLMs struggle to localize objects effectively within a scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that combines the detection capabilities of open-world detectors with the recognition confidence of LVLMs, creating a robust system for zero-shot ATR of novel classes and unknown domains. In this study, we compare the performance of various LVLMs for recognizing military vehicles, which are often underrepresented in training datasets. Additionally, we examine the impact of factors such as distance range, modality, and prompting methods on the recognition performance, providing insights into the development of more reliable ATR systems for novel conditions and classes.</p></details> |  |

CLIP, one of the most popular VLMs, has exhibited remarkable zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities in classification. To transfer CLIP to downstream tasks, adapters constitute a parameter-efficient approach that avoids backpropagation through the large model (unlike related prompt learning methods). However, CLIP adapters have been developed to target discriminative performance, and the quality of their uncertainty estimates has been overlooked. In this work we show that the discriminative performance of state-of-the-art CLIP adapters does not always correlate with their uncertainty estimation capabilities, which are essential for a safe deployment in real-world scenarios. We also demonstrate that one of such adapters is obtained through MAP inference from a more general probabilistic framework. Based on this observation we introduce BayesAdapter, which leverages Bayesian inference to estimate a full probability distribution instead of a single point, better capturing the variability inherent in the parameter space. In a comprehensive empirical evaluation we show that our approach obtains high quality uncertainty estimates in the predictions, standing out in calibration and selective classification.

Early screening is crucial for effective intervention, as timely identification of mental health issues can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be valuable for improving the screening of mental disorders, enabling early intervention and better treatment outcomes. AI-driven screening can leverage the analysis of multiple data sources, including facial features in digital images. However, existing methods often rely on controlled environments or specialized equipment, limiting their broad applicability. This study explores the potential of AI models for ubiquitous depression-anxiety screening given face-centric selfies. The investigation focuses on high-risk pregnant patients, a population that is particularly vulnerable to mental health issues. To cope with limited training data resulting from our clinical setup, pre-trained models were utilized in two different approaches: fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) originally designed for facial expression recognition and employing vision-language models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of facial expressions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed VLM-based method significantly outperforms CNNs, achieving an accuracy of 77.6%.

However, a comprehensive study to test the ability of VLMs to evaluate and reason over handwritten content remains absent. To address this gap, we introduce FERMAT, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of VLMs to detect, localize and correct errors in handwritten mathematical content. FERMAT spans four key error dimensions - computational, conceptual, notational, and presentation - and comprises over 2,200 handwritten math solutions derived from 609 manually curated problems from grades 7-12 with intentionally introduced perturbations. Using FERMAT we benchmark nine VLMs across three tasks: error detection, localization, and correction. Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%). We also observed that some models struggle with processing handwritten content, as their accuracy improves when handwritten inputs are replaced with printed text or images. These findings highlight the limitations of current VLMs and reveal new avenues for improvement. We release FERMAT and all the associated resources in the open-source to drive further research.</p></details> |  |

This capability is particularly crucial in tasks like Video Question Answering (VideoQA), where the goal is to process visual data over time together with textual data to provide coherent answers. However, current VideoQA benchmarks devote little focus to evaluating this critical skill due to the challenge of annotating temporal logic. Despite the advancement of vision-language models, assessing their temporal logical reasoning powers remains a challenge, primarily due to the lack QA pairs that demand formal, complex temporal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the TimeLogic QA (TLQA) framework to automatically generate the QA pairs, specifically designed to evaluate the temporal logical understanding. To this end, TLQA leverages temporal annotations from existing video datasets together with temporal operators derived from logic theory to construct questions that test understanding of event sequences and their temporal relationships. TLQA framework is generic and scalable, capable of leveraging both, existing video action datasets with temporal action segmentation annotations, or video datasets with temporal scene graph annotations, to automatically generate temporal logical questions. We leverage 4 datasets, STAR, Breakfast, AGQA, and CrossTask, and generate two VideoQA dataset variants - small (TLQA-S) and large (TLQA-L) - containing 2k and 10k QA pairs for each category, resulting in 32k and 160k total pairs per dataset. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of leading-edge VideoQA models, employing the TLQA to benchmark their temporal logical understanding capabilities. We assess the VideoQA model's temporal reasoning performance on 16 categories of temporal logic with varying temporal complexity.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a progressive concept-based alignment strategy, PSA-VLM, which incorporates safety modules as concept bottlenecks to enhance visual modality safety alignment. By aligning model predictions with specific safety concepts, we improve defenses against risky images, enhancing explainability and controllability while minimally impacting general performance. Our method is obtained through two-stage training. The low computational cost of the first stage brings very effective performance improvement, and the fine-tuning of the language model in the second stage further improves the safety performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular VLM safety benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.13581</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly focus on learning semantic representations of seen compositions but often fail to disentangle the independent features of states and objects in images, thereby limiting their ability to generalize to unseen compositions. To address this challenge, we propose Duplex, a novel dual-prototype learning method that integrates semantic and visual prototypes through a carefully designed dual-branch architecture, enabling effective representation learning for compositional tasks. Duplex utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to adaptively update visual prototypes, capturing complex interactions between states and objects. Additionally, it leverages the strong visual-semantic alignment of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and employs a multi-path architecture combined with prompt engineering to align image and text representations, ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that Duplex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed-world and open-world settings.</p></details> |  |

In skin cancer diagnosis, while advancements in lesion detection and classification have improved accuracy, the black-box nature of these methods poses challenges in understanding their decision processes, leading to trust issues among physicians. This study leverages the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model, trained on different skin lesion datasets, to capture meaningful relationships between visual features and diagnostic criteria terms. To further enhance transparency, we propose a method called MedGrad E-CLIP, which builds on gradient-based E-CLIP by incorporating a weighted entropy mechanism designed for complex medical imaging like skin lesions. This approach highlights critical image regions linked to specific diagnostic descriptions. The developed integrated pipeline not only classifies skin lesions by matching corresponding descriptions but also adds an essential layer of explainability developed especially for medical data. By visually explaining how different features in an image relates to diagnostic criteria, this approach demonstrates the potential of advanced vision-language models in medical image analysis, ultimately improving transparency, robustness, and trust in AI-driven diagnostic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW)</p></details> |

CIR finds applications in a variety of domains including product retrieval (e-commerce) and web search. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning, wherein models are trained on datasets of labeled triplets such as FashionIQ and CIRR. This poses two significant challenges: (i) curating such triplet datasets is labor intensive; and (ii) models lack generalization to unseen objects and domains. In this work, we propose SCOT (Self-supervised COmpositional Training), a novel zero-shot compositional pretraining strategy that combines existing large image-text pair datasets with the generative capabilities of large language models to contrastively train an embedding composition network. Specifically, we show that the text embedding from a large-scale contrastively-pretrained vision-language model can be utilized as proxy target supervision during compositional pretraining, replacing the target image embedding. In zero-shot settings, this strategy surpasses SOTA zero-shot compositional retrieval methods as well as many fully-supervised methods on standard benchmarks such as FashionIQ and CIRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at WACV 2025 in round 1</p></details> |

However, these methods optimize for a single reward that aligns model generation with population-level preferences, neglecting the nuances of individual users' beliefs or values. This lack of personalization limits the efficacy of these models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPD, a multi-reward optimization objective that aligns diffusion models with personalized preferences. With PPD, a diffusion model learns the individual preferences of a population of users in a few-shot way, enabling generalization to unseen users. Specifically, our approach (1) leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to extract personal preference embeddings from a small set of pairwise preference examples, and then (2) incorporates the embeddings into diffusion models through cross attention. Conditioning on user embeddings, the text-to-image models are fine-tuned with the DPO objective, simultaneously optimizing for alignment with the preferences of multiple users. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively optimizes for multiple reward functions and can interpolate between them during inference. In real-world user scenarios, with as few as four preference examples from a new user, our approach achieves an average win rate of 76\% over Stable Cascade, generating images that more accurately reflect specific user preferences.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate VH, various decoding strategies have been proposed to enhance visual information. However, many of these methods may require secondary decoding and rollback, which significantly reduces inference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient plug-and-play decoding algorithm via Visual-Aware Sparsification (VASparse) from the perspective of token sparsity for mitigating VH. VASparse is inspired by empirical observations: (1) the sparse activation of attention in LVLMs, and (2) visual-agnostic tokens sparsification exacerbates VH. Based on these insights, we propose a novel token sparsification strategy that balances efficiency and trustworthiness. Specifically, VASparse implements a visual-aware token selection strategy during decoding to reduce redundant tokens while preserving visual context effectively. Additionally, we innovatively introduce a sparse-based visual contrastive decoding method to recalibrate the distribution of hallucinated outputs without the time overhead associated with secondary decoding. Subsequently, VASparse recalibrates attention scores to penalize attention sinking of LVLMs towards text tokens. Extensive experiments across four popular benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of VASparse in mitigating VH across different LVLM families without requiring additional training or post-processing. Impressively, VASparse achieves state-of-the-art performance for mitigating VH while maintaining competitive decoding speed.

With the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), employing VLMs to improve this field has emerged as a popular research topic. However, most existing methods are studied on self-built question-answering datasets, lacking a unified training and testing benchmark for walk guidance. Moreover, in blind walking task, it is necessary to perform real-time streaming video parsing and generate concise yet informative reminders, which poses a great challenge for VLMs that suffer from redundant responses and low inference efficiency. In this paper, we firstly release a diverse, extensive, and unbiased walking awareness dataset, containing 12k video-manual annotation pairs from Europe and Asia to provide a fair training and testing benchmark for blind walking task. Furthermore, a WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code will be released at anonymous link https://walkvlm2024.github.io.</p></details> |  |

This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in multimodal models, such as CleanCLIP, which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives that lead to higher zero-shot classification performance correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning, is ineffective in poison removal when stronger pre-training objectives are used. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=Conma3qnaT)</p></details> |

Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to provide responsive and adaptable services. However, existing methods primarily focus on either vehicle scheduling or path planning, which often simplify complex urban layouts and neglect the necessity for simultaneous coordination and mutual avoidance among CAVs. This oversimplification poses significant challenges to the deployment of AMoD systems in real-world scenarios. To address these gaps, we propose CoDriveVLM, a novel framework that integrates high-fidelity simultaneous dispatching and cooperative motion planning for future AMoD systems. Our method harnesses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance multi-modality information processing, and this enables comprehensive dispatching and collision risk evaluation. The VLM-enhanced CAV dispatching coordinator is introduced to effectively manage complex and unforeseen AMoD conditions, thus supporting efficient scheduling decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a scalable decentralized cooperative motion planning method via consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) focusing on collision risk evaluation and decentralized trajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of CoDriveVLM in various traffic conditions, showcasing its potential to significantly improve the fidelity and effectiveness of AMoD systems in future urban transportation networks.

(3) Scalable SFT via quantity and quality scaling: We introduce general guidance for instruction data curation to scale up instruction data continuously, allowing us to construct a large SFT dataset with the highest quality. To further improve SAIL-VL's performance, we propose quality scaling, a multi-stage training recipe with curriculum learning, to improve model performance scaling curves w.r.t. data sizes from logarithmic to be near-linear. SAIL-VL obtains the highest average score in 19 commonly used benchmarks in our evaluation and achieves top1 performance among VLMs of comparable sizes on OpenCompass (https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal).

Existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. Most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. For example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often depict activities of one person in a single scene. Although existing movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos, and frequently encounter data leakage issues given the use of subtitles and other information about commercial movies during LLM pretraining. To address the above limitations, we propose Short-Films 20K (SF20K), the largest publicly available movie dataset. SF20K is composed of 20,143 amateur films and offers long-term video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering. Our extensive analysis of SF20K reveals minimal data leakage, emphasizes the need for long-term reasoning, and demonstrates the strong performance of recent VLMs. Finally, we show that instruction tuning on the SF20K-Train set substantially improves model performance, paving the way for future progress in long-term video understanding.</p></details> |  |

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we call MoColl, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.</p></details> |  |

This limitation is particularly evident in ADL tasks, where understanding detailed human-object interaction and human-centric motion is crucial for applications such as elderly monitoring and cognitive assessment. To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose an online ego2exo distillation approach to learn ego-augmented exo representations in LVLMs. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo training data, which is impractical to collect for real-world ADL scenarios. Consequently, we develop EgoMimic, a skeleton-guided method that can generate mimicked ego views from exocentric videos. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed EgoPerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos.

These results demonstrate the ability of the system to deliver rapid and precise scene recognition, which can be used to meet the critical requirements of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). This study shows the potential of CLIP models to provide scalable and efficient frameworks for dynamic scene understanding and classification.

Many existing approaches directly utilize visual or textual features as class prototypes, however, these features fail to adequately represent their respective classes. We identify that this limitation arises from the modality gap inherent in pretrained vision-language models, which weakens the connection between the visual and textual modalities. To eliminate this modality gap and enable textual features to fully represent class prototypes, we propose a simple and efficient Cross-Modal Mapping (CMM) method. This method employs a linear transformation to map image features into the textual feature space, ensuring that both modalities are comparable within the same feature space. Nevertheless, the modality gap diminishes the effectiveness of this mapping. To address this, we further introduce a triplet loss to optimize the spatial relationships between image features and class textual features, allowing class textual features to naturally serve as class prototypes for image features. Experimental results on 11 benchmark demonstrate an average improvement of approximately 3.5% compared to conventional methods and exhibit competitive performance on 4 distribution shift benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</p></details> |  |

Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions.

Such data is almost always curated from in-the-wild videos, given the cross-modal semantic correspondence that is inherent to them. In this work, we hypothesize that insisting on the absolute need for ground truth audio-visual correspondence, is not only unnecessary, but also leads to severe restrictions in scale, quality, and diversity of the data, ultimately impairing its use in the modern generative models. That is, we propose a scalable image sonification framework where instances from a variety of high-quality yet disjoint uni-modal origins can be artificially paired through a retrieval process that is empowered by reasoning capabilities of modern vision-language models. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we use our sonified images to train an audio-to-image generative model that performs competitively against state-of-the-art. Finally, through a series of ablation studies, we exhibit several intriguing auditory capabilities like semantic mixing and interpolation, loudness calibration and acoustic space modeling through reverberation that our model has implicitly developed to guide the image generation process.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance in 3D spatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains limited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images as inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely vision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on visual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates the limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary shortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene and individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual prompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the global-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding of indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a 3D Bird's Eye View (BEV) image from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the BEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames with markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over closed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video dataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks. Surprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently improve during inference, even without visual prompting and BEV image as explicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs develop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a noninvasive approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gpt4scene.github.io/</p></details> |

However, prior research works have predominantly focused on enhancing Far-OOD performance, while potentially compromising Near-OOD efficacy, as observed from our pilot study. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) and VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID labels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature extraction using CLIP. We then isolate the core semantic features for ID data by subtracting background features from the superclass features. The refined representation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels for OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby enhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning to adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95. Additionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift across different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the task. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that one can (i) include as many as 100 training languages simultaneously (ii) with as little as 25-50\% of non-English data, to greatly improve multilingual performance while retaining strong English performance. We further find that (iii) including non-English OCR data in pre-training and instruction-tuning is paramount for improving multilingual text-in-image understanding. Finally, we put all our findings together and train Centurio, a 100-language LVLM, offering state-of-the-art performance in an evaluation covering 14 tasks and 56 languages.</p></details> |  |

However, most MLLMs require very high computational resources, which is a major challenge for most researchers and developers. In this paper, we explored the utility of small-scale MLLMs and applied small-scale MLLMs to the field of autonomous driving. We hope that this will advance the application of MLLMs in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 7.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information. However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions. In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary. This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings. Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art. SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 Figures |

This study introduces VLBias, a framework that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs to detect linguistic and visual biases in news content. We present a multimodal dataset comprising textual content and corresponding images from diverse news sources. We propose a hybrid annotation framework that combines LLM-based annotations with human review to ensure high-quality labeling while reducing costs and enhancing scalability. Our evaluation compares the performance of state-of-the-art SLMs and LLMs for both modalities (text and images) and the results reveal that while SLMs are computationally efficient, LLMs demonstrate superior accuracy in identifying subtle framing and text-visual inconsistencies. Furthermore, empirical analysis shows that incorporating visual cues alongside textual data improves bias detection accuracy by 3 to 5%. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of LLMs, SLMs, and VLMs as tools for detecting multimodal biases in news content and highlights their respective strengths, limitations, and potential for future applications</p></details> | Under review |

An accident can appear in a wide variety of forms, and understanding what type of accident is taking place may be useful to prevent it from recurring. This work focuses on classifying traffic scenes into specific accident types. We approach the problem by representing a traffic scene as a graph, where objects such as cars can be represented as nodes, and relative distances and directions between them as edges. This representation of a traffic scene is referred to as a scene graph, and can be used as input for an accident classifier. Better results are obtained with a classifier that fuses the scene graph input with visual and textual representations. This work introduces a multi-stage, multimodal pipeline that pre-processes videos of traffic accidents, encodes them as scene graphs, and aligns this representation with vision and language modalities before executing the classification task. When trained on 4 classes, our method achieves a balanced accuracy score of 57.77% on an (unbalanced) subset of the popular Detection of Traffic Anomaly (DoTA) benchmark, representing an increase of close to 5 percentage points from the case where scene graph information is not taken into account.</p></details> | <details><summary>Won t...</summary><p>Won the 'Best Paper Runner-up Award' at the 2024 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2024).

Our GLOV meta-prompts an LLM with the downstream task description, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot classification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to a purity measure obtained through a fitness function. In each respective optimization step, the ranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip the LLM with the knowledge of the type of text prompts preferred by the downstream VLM. Furthermore, we also explicitly steer the LLM generation process in each optimization step by specifically adding an offset difference vector of the embeddings from the positive and negative solutions found by the LLM, in previous optimization steps, to the intermediate layer of the network for the next generation step. This offset vector steers the LLM generation toward the type of language preferred by the downstream VLM, resulting in enhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively evaluate our GLOV on 16 diverse datasets using two families of VLMs, i.e., dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LLaVa) models -- showing that the discovered solutions can enhance the recognition performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% (3.8% and 21.6% on average) for these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/jmiemirza/GLOV</p></details> |

However, multi-modal RAG systems face unique challenges: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant entries to user query (e.g., images, documents), and (ii) vision-language models or multi-modal language models like GPT-4o may hallucinate when processing these entries to generate RAG output. In this paper, we aim to address the first challenge, i.e, improving the selection of relevant context from the knowledge-base in retrieval phase of the multi-modal RAG. Specifically, we leverage the relevancy score (RS) measure designed in our previous work for evaluating the RAG performance to select more relevant entries in retrieval process. The retrieval based on embeddings, say CLIP-based embedding, and cosine similarity usually perform poorly particularly for multi-modal data. We show that by using a more advanced relevancy measure, one can enhance the retrieval process by selecting more relevant pieces from the knowledge-base and eliminate the irrelevant pieces from the context by adaptively selecting up-to-$k$ entries instead of fixed number of entries. Our evaluation using COCO dataset demonstrates significant enhancement in selecting relevant context and accuracy of the generated response.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises simple, stacked, and grouped bar charts, targeting the unique structural features of these visualizations. The finetuned DEPLOT model is evaluated against its base version using a test set of 1,000 images and two metrics: Relative Mapping Similarity (RMS), which measures categorical mapping accuracy, and Relative Number Set Similarity (RNSS), which evaluates numerical interpretation accuracy. To further explore the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we curate an additional set of 100 bar chart images paired with question answer sets. Our findings demonstrate that providing a structured intermediate table alongside the image significantly enhances LLM reasoning performance compared to direct image queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks to evaluate visual reasoning in LVLMs often rely on schematic or synthetic images and on imprecise machine-generated explanations. To bridge the modality gap, we present DrivingVQA, a new benchmark derived from driving theory tests to evaluate visual chain-of-thought reasoning in complex real-world scenarios. It offers 3,931 expert-crafted multiple-choice problems and interleaved explanations grounded with entities relevant to the reasoning process.

Our experiments reveal that open-source and proprietary LVLMs struggle with visual chain-of-thought reasoning under zero-shot settings. We investigate training strategies that leverage relevant entities to improve visual reasoning.

While their practical benefits are widely acknowledged, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the contrastive pre-training framework remains limited. This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain the success of contrastive pre-training in downstream tasks, such as zero-shot classification, conditional diffusion models, and vision-language models. We introduce the concept of approximate sufficient statistics, a generalization of the classical sufficient statistics, and show that near-minimizers of the contrastive pre-training loss are approximately sufficient, making them adaptable to diverse downstream tasks. We further propose the Joint Generative Hierarchical Model for the joint distribution of images and text, showing that transformers can efficiently approximate relevant functions within this model via belief propagation. Building on this framework, we derive sample complexity guarantees for multi-modal learning based on contrastive pre-trained representations. Numerical simulations validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating the strong generalization performance of contrastively pre-trained transformers in various multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | 108 pages |

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of 3D PAI is often degraded due to reconstruction artifacts caused by the sparse and angle-limited configuration of detector arrays. Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either time-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their practical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a zero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight network, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive to irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to the acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn stimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction results, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires neither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of artifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or slice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited detector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact removal and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in both simulation study and $ in\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate that ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing zero-shot methods, and for the $ in\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from 17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds. The project for ZS-A2A will be available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/ZS-A2A.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promising potential across a diverse array of preclinical and clinical applications, the clinical implementation of PAI faces significant challenges, including the trade-off between penetration depth and spatial resolution, as well as the demand for faster imaging speeds. This paper explores the fundamental principles underlying PAI, with a particular emphasis on three primary implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), and photoacoustic endoscopy (PAE). We undertake a critical assessment of their respective strengths and practical limitations. Furthermore, recent developments in utilizing conventional or deep learning (DL) methodologies for image reconstruction and artefact mitigation across PACT, PAM, and PAE are outlined, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance image quality and accelerate imaging processes. Furthermore, this paper examines the recent developments in quantitative analysis within PAI, including the quantification of haemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and other physiological parameters within tissues. Finally, our discussion encompasses current trends and future directions in PAI research while emphasizing the transformative impact of deep learning on advancing PAI.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (2 experts). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |

In practical implementations, large-scale 3D real-time PAI systems typically utilize sparse two-dimensional (2D) sensor arrays with certain angular deficiencies, necessitating advanced iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms to achieve quantitative PAI and reduce reconstruction artifacts. However, for existing IR algorithms, multi-frame 3D reconstruction leads to extremely high memory consumption and prolonged computation time, with limited consideration of the spatial-temporal continuity between data frames. Here, we propose a novel method, named the 4D sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (4D SlingBAG) algorithm, based on the current point cloud-based IR algorithm sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG), which has minimal memory consumption among IR methods. Our 4D SlingBAG method applies spatial-temporal coupled deformation functions to each Gaussian sphere in point cloud, thus explicitly learning the deformations features of the dynamic 3D PA scene. This allows for the efficient representation of various physiological processes (such as pulsation) or external pressures (e.g., blood perfusion experiments) contributing to changes in vessel morphology and blood flow during dynamic 3D PAI, enabling highly efficient IR for dynamic 3D PAI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that 4D SlingBAG achieves high-quality dynamic 3D PA reconstruction. Compared to performing reconstructions by using SlingBAG algorithm individually for each frame, our method significantly reduces computational time and keeps a extremely low memory consumption.

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</p></details> |  |

This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |

Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |

Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |

Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |

However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data.

Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods.

We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint.

However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

This boom originated in 2009, when a new model emerged, that is, the deep artificial neural network, which began to surpass other established mature models on some important benchmarks. Later, it was widely used in academia and industry. Ranging from image analysis to natural language processing, it fully exerted its magic and now become the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Deep neural networks have great potential in medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnosis and other healthcare issues, and is promoted in both pre-clinical and even clinical stages. In this review, we performed an overview of some new developments and challenges in the application of machine learning to medical image analysis, with a special focus on deep learning in photoacoustic imaging. The aim of this review is threefold: (i) introducing deep learning with some important basics, (ii) reviewing recent works that apply deep learning in the entire ecological chain of photoacoustic imaging, from image reconstruction to disease diagnosis, (iii) providing some open source materials and other resources for researchers interested in applying deep learning to photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A review of deep learning for photoacoustic imaging</p></details> |

Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Invertible Neural Networks for Uncertainty Quantification in Photoacoustic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05110v2)** | 2020-11-23 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.05110v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging modality which enables the recovery of functional tissue parameters such as blood oxygenation. However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2011.04997v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | [Go](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2002.09929v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |

It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
