| **[Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we apply the same framework to periodic heart time-series data to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, namely PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We demonstrate that both such pre-trained models are fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles in order to make predictions and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, tokens with the same value, that occur at different distinct points in the ECG and PPG cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space based on their phase as they propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models can be easily fine-tuned for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation. In this specific example, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved a leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG respectively. Importantly, these fine-tuned models are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DualTime: A Dual-Adapter Multimodal Language Model for Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid development of language models (LMs) has attracted attention in the field of time series, including multimodal time series modeling. However, we note that current time series multimodal methods are biased, often assigning a primary role to one modality while the other assumes a secondary role. They overlook the mutual benefits and complementary of different modalities. For example, in seizure diagnosis, relying solely on textual clinical reports makes it difficult to pinpoint the area and type of the disease, while electroencephalograms (EEGs) alone cannot provide an accurate diagnosis without considering the symptoms. In this study, based on the complementary information mining of time series multimodal data, we propose DualTime, a Dual-adapter multimodal language model for Time series representation implementing temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. By injecting lightweight adaption tokens, the LM pipeline shared by dual adapters encourages embedding alignment and achieves efficient fine-tuning. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both supervised and unsupervised settings, highlighting the complementary benefits of different modalities. In addition, we conduct few-shot label transfer experiments, which further verifies the transferability and expressiveness of our proposed DualTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ECATS: Explainable-by-design concept-based anomaly detection for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10608v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods for time series have already reached excellent performances in both prediction and classification tasks, including anomaly detection. However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted to 18th International Conference on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2024)</p></details> |

The proposed method creates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack using an IoT network simulator, Cooja, which emulates environmental sensors such as temperature and humidity. CNNs detect anomalies in time series data, resulting in a 92\% accuracy in identifying possible attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Causality in the Frequency Domain with Cross-Mapping Coherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20694v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships within a system is crucial for uncovering its underlying mechanisms. Causal discovery methods, which facilitate the construction of such models from time-series data, hold the potential to significantly advance scientific and engineering fields. This study introduces the Cross-Mapping Coherence (CMC) method, designed to reveal causal connections in the frequency domain between time series. CMC builds upon nonlinear state-space reconstruction and extends the Convergent Cross-Mapping algorithm to the frequency domain by utilizing coherence metrics for evaluation. We tested the Cross-Mapping Coherence method using simulations of logistic maps, Lorenz systems, Kuramoto oscillators, and the Wilson-Cowan model of the visual cortex. CMC accurately identified the direction of causal connections in all simulated scenarios. When applied to the Wilson-Cowan model, CMC yielded consistent results similar to spectral Granger causality. Furthermore, CMC exhibits high sensitivity in detecting weak connections, demonstrates sample efficiency, and maintains robustness in the presence of noise. In conclusion, the capability to determine directed causal influences across different frequency bands allows CMC to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex, nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ISMRNN: An Implicitly Segmented RNN Method with Mamba for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10768v4)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neuromorphic on-chip reservoir computing with spiking neural network architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20547v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing is a promising approach for harnessing the computational power of recurrent neural networks while dramatically simplifying training. This paper investigates the application of integrate-and-fire neurons within reservoir computing frameworks for two distinct tasks: capturing chaotic dynamics of the H\'enon map and forecasting the Mackey-Glass time series. Integrate-and-fire neurons can be implemented in low-power neuromorphic architectures such as Intel Loihi. We explore the impact of network topologies created through random interactions on the reservoir's performance. Our study reveals task-specific variations in network effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailored architectures for distinct computational tasks. To identify optimal network configurations, we employ a meta-learning approach combined with simulated annealing. This method efficiently explores the space of possible network structures, identifying architectures that excel in different scenarios. The resulting networks demonstrate a range of behaviors, showcasing how inherent architectural features influence task-specific capabilities. We study the reservoir computing performance using a custom integrate-and-fire code, Intel's Lava neuromorphic computing software framework, and via an on-chip implementation in Loihi. We conclude with an analysis of the energy performance of the Loihi architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures; single column</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose FedTime, a federated large language model (LLM) tailored for long-range time series prediction. Specifically, we introduce a federated pre-trained LLM with fine-tuning and alignment strategies. Prior to the learning process, we employ K-means clustering to partition edge devices or clients into distinct clusters, thereby facilitating more focused model training. We also incorporate channel independence and patching to better preserve local semantic information, ensuring that important contextual details are retained while minimizing the risk of information loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedTime model through extensive experiments on various real-world forecasting benchmarks, showcasing substantial improvements over recent approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the efficiency of FedTime in streamlining resource usage, resulting in reduced communication overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Homomorphic data compression for real time photon correlation analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20356v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of highly coherent x-ray sources has enabled new research opportunities across the scientific landscape. The maximum raw data rate per beamline now exceeds 40 GB/s, posing unprecedented challenges for the online processing and offline storage of the big data. Such challenge is particularly prominent for x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), where real time analyses require simultaneous calculation on all the previously acquired data in the time series. We present a homomorphic compression scheme to effectively reduce the computational time and memory space required for XPCS analysis. Leveraging similarities in the mathematical expression between a matrix-based compression algorithm and the correlation calculation, our approach allows direct operation on the compressed data without their decompression. The lossy compression reduces the computational time by a factor of 10,000, enabling real time calculation of the correlation functions at kHz framerate. Our demonstration of a homomorphic compression of scientific data provides an effective solution to the big data challenge at coherent light sources. Beyond the example shown in this work, the framework can be extended to facilitate real-time operations directly on a compressed data stream for other techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing Time-Series Models With Hypernetworks & Adversarial Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20352v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article describes the methods that achieved 4th and 6th place in the forecasting and investment challenges, respectively, of the M6 competition, ultimately securing the 1st place in the overall duathlon ranking. In the forecasting challenge, we tested a novel meta-learning model that utilizes hypernetworks to design a parametric model tailored to a specific family of forecasting tasks. This approach allowed us to leverage similarities observed across individual forecasting tasks while also acknowledging potential heterogeneity in their data generating processes. The model's training can be directly performed with backpropagation, eliminating the need for reliance on higher-order derivatives and is equivalent to a simultaneous search over the space of parametric functions and their optimal parameter values. The proposed model's capabilities extend beyond M6, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art meta-learning methods in the sinusoidal regression task and outperforming conventional parametric models on time-series from the M4 competition. In the investment challenge, we adjusted portfolio weights to induce greater or smaller correlation between our submission and that of other participants, depending on the current ranking, aiming to maximize the probability of achieving a good rank.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&D) level, focusing on the development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework, combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a volatile environment is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 10th Mining and Learning from Time Series Workshop: From Classical Methods to LLMs. SIGKDD, Barcelona, Spain, 6 page</p></details> |
| **[Reconstructing Global Daily CO2 Emissions via Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20057v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High temporal resolution CO2 emission data are crucial for understanding the drivers of emission changes, however, current emission dataset is only available on a yearly basis. Here, we extended a global daily CO2 emissions dataset backwards in time to 1970 using machine learning algorithm, which was trained to predict historical daily emissions on national scales based on relationships between daily emission variations and predictors established for the period since 2019. Variation in daily CO2 emissions far exceeded the smoothed seasonal variations. For example, the range of daily CO2 emissions equivalent to 31% of the year average daily emissions in China and 46% of that in India in 2022, respectively. We identified the critical emission-climate temperature (Tc) is 16.5 degree celsius for global average (18.7 degree celsius for China, 14.9 degree celsius for U.S., and 18.4 degree celsius for Japan), in which negative correlation observed between daily CO2 emission and ambient temperature below Tc and a positive correlation above it, demonstrating increased emissions associated with higher ambient temperature. The long-term time series spanning over fifty years of global daily CO2 emissions reveals an increasing trend in emissions due to extreme temperature events, driven by the rising frequency of these occurrences. This work suggests that, due to climate change, greater efforts may be needed to reduce CO2 emissions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture for Soil Moisture Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18913v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in foundation models for natural language processing and computer vision has fueled innovation across various domains. Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding: A Framework for Self-supervised Trajectory Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20028v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air traffic trajectory recognition has gained significant interest within the air traffic management community, particularly for fundamental tasks such as classification and clustering. This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

| **[ElastiBench: Scalable Continuous Benchmarking on Cloud FaaS Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13528v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Running microbenchmark suites often and early in the development process enables developers to identify performance issues in their application. Microbenchmark suites of complex applications can comprise hundreds of individual benchmarks and take multiple hours to evaluate meaningfully, making running those benchmarks as part of CI/CD pipelines infeasible. In this paper, we reduce the total execution time of microbenchmark suites by leveraging the massive scalability and elasticity of FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platforms. While using FaaS enables users to quickly scale up to thousands of parallel function instances to speed up microbenchmarking, the performance variation and low control over the underlying computing resources complicate reliable benchmarking. We demonstrate an architecture for executing microbenchmark suites on cloud FaaS platforms and evaluate it on code changes from an open-source time series database. Our evaluation shows that our prototype can produce reliable results (~95% of performance changes accurately detected) in a quarter of the time (<=15min vs.~4h) and at lower cost ($0.49 vs. ~$1.18) compared to cloud-based virtual machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 12th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Alzheimer's Dementia vs. Healthy subjects by studying structural disparities in fMRI Time-Series of DMN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19990v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series from different regions of interest (ROI) of default mode network (DMN) from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can reveal significant differences between healthy and unhealthy people. Here, we propose the utility of an existing metric quantifying the lack/presence of structure in a signal called, "deviation from stochasticity" (DS) measure to characterize resting-state fMRI time series. The hypothesis is that differences in the level of structure in the time series can lead to discrimination between the subject groups. In this work, an autoencoder-based model is utilized to learn efficient representations of data by training the network to reconstruct its input data. The proposed methodology is applied on fMRI time series of 50 healthy individuals and 50 subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), obtained from publicly available ADNI database. DS measure for healthy fMRI as expected turns out to be different compared to that of AD. Peak classification accuracy of 95% was obtained using Gradient Boosting classifier, using the DS measure applied on 100 subjects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Scenario-based Analysis: A data-driven approach to support automated driving systems development and safety evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19975v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several scenario-based frameworks exist to aid in vehicle system development and safety assurance. However, there is a need for approaches that combine different types of datasets that offer varying levels of case severity, data richness, and representativeness. This study presents an integrated scenario-based analysis approach that encompasses scenario definition, fusion, parametrization, and test case generation. For this process, ten years of fatal and non-fatal national crash data from the United States are combined with over 34 million miles of naturalistic driving data. An illustrative example scenario, "turns at intersection", is chosen to demonstrate this approach. First, scenario definitions are established from both record-based and continuous time series data. Second, a frequency analysis is performed to understand how often events from the same scenario occur at different severities across datasets. Third, an analysis is performed to show the key factors relevant to the scenario and the distribution of various parameters. Finally, a method to combine both types of data into representative test case scenarios is presented. These techniques improve scenario representativeness in two major ways: first, they populate an entire spectrum of cases ranging from routine events to fatal crashes; and second, they provide context-rich, multi-year data by combining large-scale national and naturalistic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[Response Theory via Generative Score Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01029v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce an approach for analyzing the responses of dynamical systems to external perturbations that combines score-based generative modeling with the Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT). The methodology enables accurate estimation of system responses, including those with non-Gaussian statistics. We numerically validate our approach using time-series data from three different stochastic partial differential equations of increasing complexity: an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with spatially correlated noise, a modified stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. We demonstrate the improved accuracy of the methodology over conventional methods and discuss its potential as a versatile tool for predicting the statistical behavior of complex dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey and Taxonomy: The Role of Data-Centric AI in Transformer-Based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19784v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alongside the continuous process of improving AI performance through the development of more sophisticated models, researchers have also focused their attention to the emerging concept of data-centric AI, which emphasizes the important role of data in a systematic machine learning training process. Nonetheless, the development of models has also continued apace. One result of this progress is the development of the Transformer Architecture, which possesses a high level of capability in multiple domains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and Time Series Forecasting (TSF). Its performance is, however, heavily dependent on input data preprocessing and output data evaluation, justifying a data-centric approach to future research. We argue that data-centric AI is essential for training AI models, particularly for transformer-based TSF models efficiently. However, there is a gap regarding the integration of transformer-based TSF and data-centric AI. This survey aims to pin down this gap via the extensive literature review based on the proposed taxonomy. We review the previous research works from a data-centric AI perspective and we intend to lay the foundation work for the future development of transformer-based architecture and data-centric AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiscale Representation Enhanced Temporal Flow Fusion Model for Long-Term Workload Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19697v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate workload forecasting is critical for efficient resource management in cloud computing systems, enabling effective scheduling and autoscaling. Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Towards Detecting IoT Event Spoofing Attacks Using Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19662v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices have grown in popularity since they can directly interact with the real world. Home automation systems automate these interactions. IoT events are crucial to these systems' decision-making but are often unreliable. Security vulnerabilities allow attackers to impersonate events. Using statistical machine learning, IoT event fingerprints from deployed sensors have been used to detect spoofed events. Multivariate temporal data from these sensors has structural and temporal properties that statistical machine learning cannot learn. These schemes' accuracy depends on the knowledge base; the larger, the more accurate. However, the lack of huge datasets with enough samples of each IoT event in the nascent field of IoT can be a bottleneck. In this work, we deployed advanced machine learning to detect event-spoofing assaults. The temporal nature of sensor data lets us discover important patterns with fewer events. Our rigorous investigation of a publicly available real-world dataset indicates that our time-series-based solution technique learns temporal features from sensor data faster than earlier work, even with a 100- or 500-fold smaller training sample, making it a realistic IoT solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - 49th IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Global and Local Features of Power Load Series Through Transformer and 2D-CNN: An Image-based Multi-step Forecasting Approach Incorporating Phase Space Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11553v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As modern power systems continue to evolve, accurate power load forecasting remains a critical issue in energy management. The phase space reconstruction method can effectively retain the inner chaotic property of power load from a system dynamics perspective and thus is a promising knowledge-based preprocessing method for short-term forecasting. In order to fully utilize the capability of PSR method to model the non-stationary characteristics within power load, and to solve the problem of the difficulty in applying traditional PSR prediction methods to form a general multi-step forecasting scheme, this study proposes a novel multi-step forecasting approach by delicately integrating the PSR with neural networks to establish an end-to-end learning system. Firstly, the useful features in the phase trajectory are discussed in detail. Through mathematical derivation, the equivalent characterization of the PSR and another time series preprocessing method, patch segmentation, is demonstrated for the first time. Based on this knowledge, an image-based modeling perspective is introduced. Subsequently, a novel deep learning model, namely PSR-GALIEN, is designed, in which the Transformer Encoder and 2D-CNN are employed for the extraction of the global and local patterns in the image, and a MLP-based predictor is used for the efficient correlation modeling. Then, extensive experiments are conducted on five real-world benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the PSR-GALIEN. The results show that, compared with six state-of-the-art deep learning models, the forecasting performance of PSR-GALIEN consistently surpasses these baselines, achieving superior accuracy in both intra-day and day-ahead forecasting scenarios. At the same time, the attributions of its forecasting results can be explained through the visualization-based method, which significantly increases the interpretability.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art approaches based on deep learning via neural networks achieve outstanding performance at anomaly recognition, evaluating the discrepancy between a normal model of the system (with no anomalies) and the real-time stream of sensor time series. However, large training data and time are typically required, and explainability is still a challenge to identify the root of the anomaly and implement predictive maintainance. In this paper, we use causal discovery to learn a normal causal graph of the system, and we evaluate the persistency of causal links during real-time acquisition of sensor data to promptly detect anomalies. On two benchmark anomaly detection datasets, we show that our method has higher training efficiency, outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures and correctly identifies the sources of >10 different anomalies.

Combining a Multi-Modal Data Progressive Fusion Module with a sophisticated Feature Extraction Module, Appformer leverages the synergies of multi-modal data fusion and data mining techniques while maintaining user privacy. The framework employs Points of Interest (POIs) associated with base stations, optimizing them through comprehensive comparative experiments to identify the most effective clustering method. These refined inputs are seamlessly integrated into the initial phases of cross-modal data fusion, where temporal units are encoded via word embeddings and subsequently merged in later stages. The Feature Extraction Module, employing Transformer-like architectures specialized for time series analysis, adeptly distils comprehensive features. It meticulously fine-tunes the outputs from the fusion module, facilitating the extraction of high-calibre, multi-modal features, thus guaranteeing a robust and efficient extraction process. Extensive experimental validation confirms Appformer's effectiveness, attaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in mobile app usage prediction, thereby signifying a notable progression in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise and Efficient Orbit Prediction in LEO with Machine Learning using Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11026v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing volume of space objects in Earth's orbit presents a significant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular, accurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of space objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When performing Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the SGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are able to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine learning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision ephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the period of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and time-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low computational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing faster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at IEEE WCCI CEC Congress 2024</p></details> |

In essence, the net vegetation flux is the difference of the uptake of CO$_2$ via photosynthesis and the release of CO$_2$ via respiration, while the system is driven by periodic processes at different time-scales. The complexity of the underlying dynamics poses challenges to classical decomposition methods focused on maximizing data variance, such as singular spectrum analysis. Here, we explore whether nonlinear data-driven methods can better separate periodic patterns and their harmonics from noise and stochastic variability. We find that Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis (NLSA) outperforms the linear method and detects multiple relevant harmonics. However, these harmonics are not detected in the presence of substantial measurement irregularities. In summary, the NLSA approach can be used to both extract the seasonal cycle more accurately than linear methods, but likewise detect irregular signals resulting from irregular land-atmosphere interactions or measurement failures. Improving the detection capabilities of time-series decomposition is essential for improving land-atmosphere interactions models that should operate accurately on any time scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, research article</p></details> |

Our central proposition is an enhanced inference technique and long-range dependency method for SNLDS. The cornerstone of our approach is the fusion of S4 and SNLDS, leveraging the strengths of both models to effectively address the intricacies of long-range dependencies in switching time series. Through rigorous testing, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology adeptly segments and reproduces long-range dependencies in both the 1-D Lorenz dataset and the 2-D bouncing ball dataset. Notably, our integrated approach outperforms the standalone SNLDS in these tasks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[On Consistency of Signature Using Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10413v3)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signatures are iterated path integrals of continuous and discrete-time processes, and their universal nonlinearity linearizes the problem of feature selection in time series data analysis. This paper studies the consistency of signature using Lasso regression, both theoretically and numerically. We establish conditions under which the Lasso regression is consistent both asymptotically and in finite sample. Furthermore, we show that the Lasso regression is more consistent with the It\^o signature for time series and processes that are closer to the Brownian motion and with weaker inter-dimensional correlations, while it is more consistent with the Stratonovich signature for mean-reverting time series and processes. We demonstrate that signature can be applied to learn nonlinear functions and option prices with high accuracy, and the performance depends on properties of the underlying process and the choice of the signature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Automotive Supply Chain Shortfalls with Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16739v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational disruptions can significantly impact companies performance. Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metadata-enhanced contrastive learning from retinal optical coherence tomography images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02529v3)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has potential to automate screening, monitoring and grading of disease in medical images. Pretraining with contrastive learning enables models to extract robust and generalisable features from natural image datasets, facilitating label-efficient downstream image analysis. However, the direct application of conventional contrastive methods to medical datasets introduces two domain-specific issues. Firstly, several image transformations which have been shown to be crucial for effective contrastive learning do not translate from the natural image to the medical image domain. Secondly, the assumption made by conventional methods, that any two images are dissimilar, is systematically misleading in medical datasets depicting the same anatomy and disease. This is exacerbated in longitudinal image datasets that repeatedly image the same patient cohort to monitor their disease progression over time. In this paper we tackle these issues by extending conventional contrastive frameworks with a novel metadata-enhanced strategy. Our approach employs widely available patient metadata to approximate the true set of inter-image contrastive relationships. To this end we employ records for patient identity, eye position (i.e. left or right) and time series information. In experiments using two large longitudinal datasets containing 170,427 retinal OCT images of 7,912 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we evaluate the utility of using metadata to incorporate the temporal dynamics of disease progression into pretraining. Our metadata-enhanced approach outperforms both standard contrastive methods and a retinal image foundation model in five out of six image-level downstream tasks related to AMD. Due to its modularity, our method can be quickly and cost-effectively tested to establish the potential benefits of including available metadata in contrastive pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</p></details> |  |

In financial domains, learning informative representations for assets can be used for tasks like sector classification, and risk management. However, the complex and stochastic nature of financial markets poses unique challenges. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework to generate asset embeddings from financial time series data. Our approach leverages the similarity of asset returns over many subwindows to generate informative positive and negative samples, using a statistical sampling strategy based on hypothesis testing to address the noisy nature of financial data. We explore various contrastive loss functions that capture the relationships between assets in different ways to learn a discriminative representation space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned asset embeddings on benchmark industry classification and portfolio optimization tasks. In each case our novel approaches significantly outperform existing baselines highlighting the potential for contrastive learning to capture meaningful and actionable relationships in financial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Recurrent Neural Networks and Deep Learning Frameworks on Real-time Lightweight Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18439v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection has become increasingly crucial in cybersecurity and many other domains. Its ability to adapt to unforeseen pattern changes and swiftly identify anomalies enables prompt responses and critical decision-making. While several such anomaly detection approaches have been introduced in recent years, they primarily utilize a single type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and have been implemented in only one deep learning framework. It is unclear how the use of different types of RNNs available in various deep learning frameworks affects the performance of these anomaly detection approaches due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations. Arbitrarily choosing a RNN variant and a deep learning framework to implement an anomaly detection approach may not reflect its true performance and could potentially mislead users into favoring one approach over another. In this paper, we aim to study the influence of various types of RNNs available in popular deep learning frameworks on real-time lightweight time series anomaly detection. We reviewed several state-of-the-art approaches and implemented a representative anomaly detection approach using well-known RNN variants supported by three widely recognized deep learning frameworks. A comprehensive evaluation is then conducted to analyze the performance of each implementation across real-world, open-source time series datasets. The evaluation results provide valuable guidance for selecting the appropriate RNN variant and deep learning framework for real-time, lightweight time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, The 26th International Conference on Information and Communications Security, 26-28 August, 2024, Mytilene, Lesvos, Greece (ICICS2024)</p></details> |

We train a specific class of deep auto-encoders that learn to reproduce the input waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck, and then use a simple triggering algorithm at the bottleneck to label waveforms as noise or signal. Our approach is motivated by the intuition that efficient compression of data should represent signals differently from noise, and is facilitated by a time-axis-preserving approach to auto-encoding and intuitively-motivated choices on the architecture and triggering. We demonstrate that the detection performance of the unsupervised approach is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some of the state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, it has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization}. By experimenting with various modifications, we demonstrate that the detection performance is insensitive to various technical choices made in the algorithm. Our approach has the potential to be useful for other signal detection problems with time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-TGRS</p></details> |

A benchmark and analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16445v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and weather. However, the task of selecting the most suitable forecasting method for a given dataset is a complex task due to the diversity of data patterns and characteristics. This research aims to address this challenge by proposing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and ranking time series forecasting methods across a wide range of datasets. This study investigates the comparative performance of many methods from two prominent time series forecasting frameworks, AutoGluon-Timeseries, and sktime to shed light on their applicability in different real-world scenarios.

| **[Quadratic Advantage with Quantum Randomized Smoothing Applied to Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18021v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum machine learning continues to develop at a rapid pace, the importance of ensuring the robustness and efficiency of quantum algorithms cannot be overstated. Our research presents an analysis of quantum randomized smoothing, how data encoding and perturbation modeling approaches can be matched to achieve meaningful robustness certificates. By utilizing an innovative approach integrating Grover's algorithm, a quadratic sampling advantage over classical randomized smoothing is achieved. This strategy necessitates a basis state encoding, thus restricting the space of meaningful perturbations. We show how constrained $k$-distant Hamming weight perturbations are a suitable noise distribution here, and elucidate how they can be constructed on a quantum computer. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated on a time series classification task employing a Bag-of-Words pre-processing solution. The advantage of quadratic sample reduction is recovered especially in the regime with large number of samples. This may allow quantum computers to efficiently scale randomized smoothing to more complex tasks beyond the reach of classical methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)</p></details> |
| **[Targeted stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo for hidden Markov models with rare latent states](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13431v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for hidden Markov models often rely on the forward-backward sampler. This makes them computationally slow as the length of the time series increases, motivating the development of sub-sampling-based approaches. These approximate the full posterior by using small random subsequences of the data at each MCMC iteration within stochastic gradient MCMC. In the presence of imbalanced data resulting from rare latent states, subsequences often exclude rare latent state data, leading to inaccurate inference and prediction/detection of rare events. We propose a targeted sub-sampling (TASS) approach that over-samples observations corresponding to rare latent states when calculating the stochastic gradient of parameters associated with them. TASS uses an initial clustering of the data to construct subsequence weights that reduce the variance in gradient estimation. This leads to improved sampling efficiency, in particular in settings where the rare latent states correspond to extreme observations. We demonstrate substantial gains in predictive and inferential accuracy on real and synthetic examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAM: Towards A Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17880v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is challenging to scale time series forecasting models such that they forecast accurately for multiple distinct domains and datasets, all with potentially different underlying collection procedures (e.g., sample resolution), patterns (e.g., periodicity), and prediction requirements (e.g., reconstruction vs. forecasting). We call this general task universal forecasting. Existing methods usually assume that input data is regularly sampled, and they forecast to pre-determined horizons, resulting in failure to generalise outside of the scope of their training. We propose the DAM - a neural model that takes randomly sampled histories and outputs an adjustable basis composition as a continuous function of time for forecasting to non-fixed horizons. It involves three key components: (1) a flexible approach for using randomly sampled histories from a long-tail distribution, that enables an efficient global perspective of the underlying temporal dynamics while retaining focus on the recent history; (2) a transformer backbone that is trained on these actively sampled histories to produce, as representational output, (3) the basis coefficients of a continuous function of time. We show that a single univariate DAM, trained on 25 time series datasets, either outperformed or closely matched existing SoTA models at multivariate long-term forecasting across 18 datasets, including 8 held-out for zero-shot transfer, even though these models were trained to specialise for each dataset-horizon combination. This single DAM excels at zero-shot transfer and very-long-term forecasting, performs well at imputation, is interpretable via basis function composition and attention, can be tuned for different inference-cost requirements, is robust to missing and irregularly sampled data {by design}.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, SSMs capture only the temporal dynamics of time series data, omitting the equally critical spectral features. This study introduces EEG-SSM, a novel state-space model-based approach for dementia classification using EEG data. Our model features two primary innovations: EEG-SSM temporal and EEG-SSM spectral components. The temporal component is designed to efficiently process EEG sequences of varying lengths, while the spectral component enhances the model by integrating frequency-domain information from EEG signals. The synergy of these components allows EEG-SSM to adeptly manage the complexities of multivariate EEG data, significantly improving accuracy and stability across different temporal resolutions. Demonstrating a remarkable 91.0 percent accuracy in classifying Healthy Control (HC), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) groups, EEG-SSM outperforms existing models on the same dataset. The development of EEG-SSM represents an improvement in the use of state-space models for screening dementia, offering more precise and cost-effective tools for clinical neuroscience.</p></details> |  |

Given the emerging trend, we present the first survey dedicated to HNNs, with an in-depth and step-by-step guide. Broadly, the present survey overviews HNN architectures, training strategies, and applications. First, we break existing HNNs down into four design components: (i) input features, (ii) input structures, (iii) message-passing schemes, and (iv) training strategies. Second, we examine how HNNs address and learn HOIs with each of their components.

However, forecasting the structure of a graph at future time steps incorporating unseen, new nodes and edges has not gained much attention. In this paper, we present such an approach. Using a time series of graphs, we forecast graphs at future time steps. We use time series forecasting methods to predict the node degree at future time points and combine these forecasts with flux balance analysis -- a linear programming method used in biochemistry -- to obtain the structure of future graphs.

| **[POCKET: Pruning Random Convolution Kernels for Time Series Classification from a Feature Selection Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08499v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, two competitive time series classification models, namely, ROCKET and MINIROCKET, have garnered considerable attention due to their low training cost and high accuracy. However, they rely on a large number of random 1-D convolutional kernels to comprehensively capture features, which is incompatible with resource-constrained devices. Despite the development of heuristic algorithms designed to recognize and prune redundant kernels, the inherent time-consuming nature of evolutionary algorithms hinders efficient evaluation. To efficiently prune models, this paper eliminates feature groups contributing minimally to the classifier, thereby discarding the associated random kernels without direct evaluation. To this end, we incorporate both group-level ($l_{2,1}$-norm) and element-level ($l_2$-norm) regularizations to the classifier, formulating the pruning challenge as a group elastic net classification problem. An ADMM-based algorithm is initially introduced to solve the problem, but it is computationally intensive. Building on the ADMM-based algorithm, we then propose our core algorithm, POCKET, which significantly speeds up the process by dividing the task into two sequential stages. In Stage 1, POCKET utilizes dynamically varying penalties to efficiently achieve group sparsity within the classifier, removing features associated with zero weights and their corresponding kernels. In Stage 2, the remaining kernels and features are used to refit a $l_2$-regularized classifier for enhanced performance. Experimental results on diverse time series datasets show that POCKET prunes up to 60% of kernels without a significant reduction in accuracy and performs 11$\times$ faster than its counterparts.

Two representative channel strategies are closely associated with model expressivity and robustness, including channel independence (CI) and channel dependence (CD). The former adopts individual channel treatment and has been shown to be more robust to distribution shifts, but lacks sufficient capacity to model meaningful channel interactions. The latter is more expressive for representing complex cross-channel dependencies, but is prone to overfitting. To balance the two strategies, we present a channel-aware low-rank adaptation method to condition CD models on identity-aware individual components. As a plug-in solution, it is adaptable for a wide range of backbone architectures. Extensive experiments show that it can consistently and significantly improve the performance of both CI and CD models with demonstrated efficiency and flexibility.

This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) with advanced intrinsic and post-hoc interpretability techniques for detecting the onset of MDR in patients across time. Within interpretability methods, we propose Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches to handle irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS), introducing Irregular Time Shapley Additive Explanations (IT-SHAP), a modification of Shapley Additive Explanations designed for irregular MTS with Recurrent Neural Networks focused on temporal outputs. Our methodology aims to identify specific risk factors associated with MDR in ICU patients. GRU with Hadamard's attention demonstrated high initial specificity and increasing sensitivity over time, correlating with increased nosocomial infection risks during prolonged ICU stays. XAI analysis, enhanced by Hadamard attention and IT-SHAP, identified critical factors such as previous non-resistant cultures, specific antibiotic usage patterns, and hospital environment dynamics. These insights suggest that early detection of at-risk patients can inform interventions such as preventive isolation and customized treatments, significantly improving clinical outcomes. The proposed GRU model for temporal classification achieved an average Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 78.27 +- 1.26 over time, indicating strong predictive performance. In summary, this study highlights the clinical utility of our methodology, which combines predictive accuracy with interpretability, thereby facilitating more effective healthcare interventions by professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning Is Not Optimal for Quasiperiodic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17073v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for time series analysis, a noticeable gap persists between the anticipated achievements and actual performance. While these methods have demonstrated formidable generalization capabilities with minimal labels in various domains, their effectiveness in distinguishing between different classes based on a limited number of annotated records is notably lacking. Our hypothesis attributes this bottleneck to the prevalent use of Contrastive Learning, a shared training objective in previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. By mandating distinctiveness between representations for negative pairs drawn from separate records, this approach compels the model to encode unique record-based patterns but simultaneously neglects changes occurring across the entire record. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Distilled Embedding for Almost-Periodic Time Series (DEAPS) in this paper, offering a non-contrastive method tailored for quasiperiodic time series, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) data. By avoiding the use of negative pairs, we not only mitigate the model's blindness to temporal changes but also enable the integration of a "Gradual Loss (Lgra)" function. This function guides the model to effectively capture dynamic patterns evolving throughout the record. The outcomes are promising, as DEAPS demonstrates a notable improvement of +10% over existing SOTA methods when just a few annotated records are presented to fit a Machine Learning (ML) model based on the learned representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Numerous models have been proposed, striving to estimate the distribution of the data. The Radial Basis Functions Neural Network (RBFNN) has recently exhibited exceptional performance in estimating data distribution. In this paper, we propose a time series imputation model based on RBFNN. Our imputation model learns local information from timestamps to create a continuous function. Additionally, we incorporate time gaps to facilitate learning information considering the missing terms of missing values. We name this model the Missing Imputation Multivariate RBFNN (MIM-RBFNN). However, MIM-RBFNN relies on a local information-based learning approach, which presents difficulties in utilizing temporal information. Therefore, we propose an extension called the Missing Value Imputation Recurrent Neural Network with Continuous Function (MIRNN-CF) using the continuous function generated by MIM-RBFNN. We evaluate the performance using two real-world datasets with non-random missing and random missing patterns, and conduct an ablation study comparing MIM-RBFNN and MIRNN-CF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Schrödinger Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14504v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.</p></details> |  |

To address the scarcity of labeled time series data, various strategies, e.g., transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, have been developed. In this survey, we introduce a novel taxonomy for the first time, categorizing existing approaches as in-domain or cross-domain, based on their reliance on external data sources or not. Furthermore, we present a review of the recent advances in each strategy, conclude the limitations of current methodologies, and suggest future research directions that promise further improvements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (TAI) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601520</p></details> |
| **[TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11219v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nellie689/TLRN.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. Accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

We consider neural networks with piecewise linear activations and depths ranging from 2 to an arbitrary but finite number of layers. We first show that two-layer networks with piecewise linear activations are equivalent to Lasso models using a discrete dictionary of ramp functions, with breakpoints corresponding to the training data points. In certain general architectures with absolute value or ReLU activations, a third layer surprisingly creates features that reflect the training data about themselves. Additional layers progressively generate reflections of these reflections. The Lasso representation provides valuable insights into the analysis of globally optimal networks, elucidating their solution landscapes and enabling closed-form solutions in certain special cases. Numerical results show that reflections also occur when optimizing standard deep networks using standard non-convex optimizers. Additionally, we demonstrate our theory with autoregressive time series models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19888v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeInf: Time Series Data Contribution via Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15247v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the contribution of individual data points to a model's prediction is critical for interpreting model predictions and improving model performance. Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and texts; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains unexplored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. TimeInf uses influence functions to attribute model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TimeInf outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identifying harmful anomalies and helpful time points for forecasting. Additionally, TimeInf offers intuitive and interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to easily distinguish diverse anomaly patterns through visualizations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as varsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al. 2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We illustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on SVAR models and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019 causality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream datasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et al. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data. We also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal discovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most surprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high varsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a significant amount of causal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contribution for the Causal Inference for Time Series Data Workshop at the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (CI4TS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Interval Forecasts for Gas Prices in the Face of Structural Breaks -- Statistical Models vs. Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16723v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable gas price forecasts are an essential information for gas and energy traders, for risk managers and also economists. However, ahead of the war in Ukraine Europe began to suffer from substantially increased and volatile gas prices which culminated in the aftermath of the North Stream 1 explosion. This shock changed both trend and volatility structure of the prices and has considerable effects on forecasting models. In this study we investigate whether modern machine learning methods such as neural networks are more resilient against such changes than statistical models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with conditional heteroskedasticity, or copula-based time series models. Thereby the focus lies on interval forecasting and applying respective evaluation measures. As data, the Front Month prices from the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, currently the predominant European exchange, are used. We see that, during the shock period, most models underestimate the variance while overestimating the variance in the after-shock period. Furthermore, we recognize that, during the shock, the simpler models, i.e. an ARMA model with conditional heteroskedasticity and the multilayer perceptron (a neural network), perform best with regards to prediction interval coverage. Interestingly, the widely-used long-short term neural network is outperformed by its competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Autoregressive Online Change-Point Detection with Time-Varying Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16376v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These events showcased, for the first time, the potential of online social networks to catalyze financial collective action. How, when and to what extent Reddit users played a role in driving up these prices, however, remains unclear. We address these questions by statistical analysis of time series with high temporal resolution, about social activity on Reddit and Twitter as well as stock trading volumes. We find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volume before the GameStop short squeeze, with their predictive power being particularly strong on hourly time scales. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event, but waned once the community of investors gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the Reddit community, quantified through each user's financial position on GameStop, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. These evidences suggest a coordinated action by Reddit users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media. Towards the end of January, users talking about GameStop contributed to raise the popularity of BlackBerry, AMC and Nokia, which emerged as the most popular stocks as the community gained global recognition. Overall, our results shed light on the dynamics behind the first large-scale financial collective action driven by social media users.</p></details> |  |

In contemporary research, there has been a notable upsurge in exploring feature extraction through random sampling. Unlike deep convolutional networks, these methods sidestep elaborate training procedures, yet they often necessitate generating a surplus of features to comprehensively encapsulate time series nuances. Consequently, some features may lack relevance to labels or exhibit multi-collinearity with others. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature selection method aided by ANOVA variance analysis to address this challenge. Through meticulous experimentation, we demonstrate that our method substantially reduces features by over 94% while preserving accuracy -- a significant advancement in the field of time series analysis and feature selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, IEEE Machine Learning and Signal processing 2024</p></details> |

While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their inherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application in high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more understandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five years, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this paper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the need to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in practice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a complementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the finance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current role in finance.

This papers introduces novel neural network framework that blend the principles of econometric state space models with the dynamic capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

Adversarial Data Augmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability by incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen samples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts, it falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series data. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping technique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of non-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by leveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse domains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants, enhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied distributions.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of LTSF-Linear, with its straightforward linear architecture, has notably outperformed transformer-based counterparts, prompting a reevaluation of the transformer's utility in time series forecasting. In response, this paper presents an adaptation of a recent architecture termed extended LSTM (xLSTM) for LTSF. xLSTM incorporates exponential gating and a revised memory structure with higher capacity that has good potential for LTSF. Our adopted architecture for LTSF termed as xLSTMTime surpasses current approaches. We compare xLSTMTime's performance against various state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world da-tasets, demonstrating superior forecasting capabilities. Our findings suggest that refined recurrent architectures can offer competitive alternatives to transformer-based models in LTSF tasks, po-tentially redefining the landscape of time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Typically, an LLM is pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during finetuning, LLMs may forget the knowledge acquired in the pretraining stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). The key idea of MoFO is to iteratively select and update the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes. Compared to full-parameter training, MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance while keeping parameters closer to the pre-trained model, thereby mitigating knowledge forgetting. Unlike most existing methods for forgetting mitigation, MoFO combines the following two advantages. First, MoFO does not require access to pre-training data. This makes MoFO particularly suitable for fine-tuning scenarios where pre-training data is unavailable, such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. Second, MoFO does not alter the original loss function. This could avoid impairing the model performance on the fine-tuning tasks. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in mitigating forgetting and enhancing fine-tuning performance.</p></details> |  |

Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.</p></details> |  |

These agents can extend the base LLM's capabilities in multiple ways. For example, a well-built agent using GPT-3.5-Turbo as its core can outperform the more advanced GPT-4 model by leveraging external components. More importantly, the usage of tools enables these systems to perform actions in the real world, moving from merely generating text to actively interacting with their environment. Given the agents' practical applications and their ability to execute consequential actions, it is crucial to assess potential vulnerabilities. Such autonomous systems can cause more severe damage than a standalone language model if compromised. While some existing research has explored harmful actions by LLM agents, our study approaches the vulnerability from a different perspective. We introduce a new type of attack that causes malfunctions by misleading the agent into executing repetitive or irrelevant actions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using various attack methods, surfaces, and properties to pinpoint areas of susceptibility. Our experiments reveal that these attacks can induce failure rates exceeding 80\% in multiple scenarios. Through attacks on implemented and deployable agents in multi-agent scenarios, we accentuate the realistic risks associated with these vulnerabilities. To mitigate such attacks, we propose self-examination detection methods. However, our findings indicate these attacks are difficult to detect effectively using LLMs alone, highlighting the substantial risks associated with this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing safe-for-work classifiers are primarily focused on English text. To address this gap for the Malaysian language, we present a novel safe-for-work text classifier tailored specifically for Malaysian language content. By curating and annotating a first-of-its-kind dataset of Malaysian text spanning multiple content categories, we trained a classification model capable of identifying potentially unsafe material using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques. This work represents an important step in enabling safer interactions and content filtering to mitigate potential risks and ensure responsible deployment of LLMs. To maximize accessibility and promote further research towards enhancing alignment in LLM-Ops for the Malaysian context, the model is publicly released at https://huggingface.co/malaysia-ai/malaysian-sfw-classifier.</p></details> |  |

We use a train-test cross-validation setup to estimate the accuracy with which the LLMs predict both: a subject's individual political choices and the aggregate preferences of the full sample of participants. At the individual level, we find that LLMs predict out of sample preferences more accurately than a "bundle rule", which would assume that citizens always vote for the proposals of the candidate aligned with their self-reported political orientation. At the population level, we show that a probabilistic sample augmented by an LLM provides a more accurate estimate of the aggregate preferences of a population than the non-augmented probabilistic sample alone. Together, these results indicates that policy preference data augmented using LLMs can capture nuances that transcend party lines and represents a promising avenue of research for data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main manuscript with 4 figures. 13 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |

While their capabilities are undeniably impressive, it is crucial to identify and scrutinize their vulnerabilities especially when those vulnerabilities can have costly consequences. One such LLM, trained to provide a concise summarization from medical documents could unequivocally leak personal patient data when prompted surreptitiously. This is just one of many unfortunate examples that have been unveiled and further research is necessary to comprehend the underlying reasons behind such vulnerabilities. In this study, we delve into multiple sections of vulnerabilities which are model-based, training-time, inference-time vulnerabilities, and discuss mitigation strategies including "Model Editing" which aims at modifying LLMs behavior, and "Chroma Teaming" which incorporates synergy of multiple teaming strategies to enhance LLMs' resilience. This paper will synthesize the findings from each vulnerability section and propose new directions of research and development. By understanding the focal points of current vulnerabilities, we can better anticipate and mitigate future risks, paving the road for more robust and secure LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.12503</p></details> |

While improving these models traditionally relies on costly human data, recent self-rewarding mechanisms (Yuan et al., 2024) have shown that LLMs can improve by judging their own responses instead of relying on human labelers. However, existing methods have primarily focused on improving model responses rather than judgment capabilities, resulting in rapid saturation during iterative training. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Meta-Rewarding step to the self-improvement process, where the model judges its own judgements and uses that feedback to refine its judgment skills. Surprisingly, this unsupervised approach improves the model's ability to judge {\em and} follow instructions, as demonstrated by a win rate improvement of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 22.9% to 39.4% on AlpacaEval 2, and 20.6% to 29.1% on Arena-Hard.

In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering, LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test LLM's video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25 YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential and limitations of LLM's capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings, we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based on LLM-assisted video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by CSCW 24</p></details> |
| **[Can Editing LLMs Inject Harm?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20224v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing techniques have been increasingly adopted to efficiently correct the false or outdated knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the high cost of retraining from scratch. Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a high bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally. 9 pages for main paper, 36 pages including appendix.

Leakage of system prompts may compromise intellectual property, and act as adversarial reconnaissance for an attacker. A systematic evaluation of prompt leakage threats and mitigation strategies is lacking, especially for multi-turn LLM interactions. In this paper, we systematically investigate LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage for 10 closed- and open-source LLMs, across four domains. We design a unique threat model which leverages the LLM sycophancy effect and elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) from 17.7% to 86.2% in a multi-turn setting. Our standardized setup further allows dissecting leakage of specific prompt contents such as task instructions and knowledge documents. We measure the mitigation effect of 7 black-box defense strategies, along with finetuning an open-source model to defend against leakage attempts. We present different combination of defenses against our threat model, including a cost analysis. Our study highlights key takeaways for building secure LLM applications and provides directions for research in multi-turn LLM interactions</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoScale: Automatic Prediction of Compute-optimal Data Composition for Training LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20177v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure performance on a diverse set of downstream tasks, LLMs are pretrained via data mixtures over different domains. In this work, we demonstrate that the optimal data composition for a fixed compute budget varies depending on the scale of the training data, suggesting that the common practice of empirically determining an optimal composition using small-scale experiments will not yield the optimal data mixtures when scaling up to the final model. To address this challenge, we propose *AutoScale*, an automated tool that finds a compute-optimal data composition for training at any desired target scale. AutoScale first determines the optimal composition at a small scale using a novel bilevel optimization framework, Direct Data Optimization (*DDO*), and then fits a predictor to estimate the optimal composition at larger scales. The predictor's design is inspired by our theoretical analysis of scaling laws related to data composition, which could be of independent interest. In empirical studies with pre-training 774M Decoder-only LMs (GPT-2 Large) on RedPajama dataset, AutoScale decreases validation perplexity at least 25% faster than any baseline with up to 38% speed up compared to without reweighting, achieving the best overall performance across downstream tasks. On pre-training Encoder-only LMs (BERT) with masked language modeling, DDO is shown to decrease loss on all domains while visibly improving average task performance on GLUE benchmark by 8.7% and on large-scale QA dataset (SQuAD) by 5.9% compared with without reweighting. AutoScale speeds up training by up to 28%. Our codes are open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

The core idea is to decompose state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks, LLMs, and Table Neural Networks into standardized modules, to enable the fast construction of novel RTL-type models in a simple "combine, align, and co-train" manner. To illustrate the usage of rLLM, we introduce a simple RTL method named \textbf{BRIDGE}. Additionally, we present three novel relational tabular datasets (TML1M, TLF2K, and TACM12K) by enhancing classic datasets. We hope rLLM can serve as a useful and easy-to-use development framework for RTL-related tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/rllm-project/rllm.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByteCheckpoint: A Unified Checkpointing System for LLM Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20143v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of real-world Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates checkpointing of training states in persistent storage to mitigate potential software and hardware failures, as well as to facilitate checkpoint transferring within the training pipeline and across various tasks. Due to the immense size of LLMs, saving and loading checkpoints often incur intolerable minute-level stalls, significantly diminishing training efficiency. Besides, when transferring checkpoints across tasks, checkpoint resharding, defined as loading checkpoints into parallel configurations differing from those used for saving, is often required according to the characteristics and resource quota of specific tasks. Previous checkpointing systems [16,3,33,6] assume consistent parallel configurations, failing to address the complexities of checkpoint transformation during resharding. Furthermore, in the industry platform, developers create checkpoints from different training frameworks[23,36,21,11], each with its own unique storage and I/O logic. This diversity complicates the implementation of unified checkpoint management and optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteCheckpoint, a PyTorch-native multi-framework LLM checkpointing system that supports automatic online checkpoint resharding. ByteCheckpoint employs a data/metadata disaggregated storage architecture, decoupling checkpoint storage from the adopted parallelism strategies and training frameworks. We design an efficient asynchronous tensor merging technique to settle the irregular tensor sharding problem and propose several I/O performance optimizations to significantly enhance the efficiency of checkpoint saving and loading. Experimental results demonstrate ByteCheckpoint's substantial advantages in reducing checkpoint saving (by up to 529.22X) and loading (by up to 3.51X) costs, compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTasker: Mobile Task Automation Using Vision Based UI Understanding and LLM Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11190v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile task automation is an emerging field that leverages AI to streamline and optimize the execution of routine tasks on mobile devices, thereby enhancing efficiency and productivity. Traditional methods, such as Programming By Demonstration (PBD), are limited due to their dependence on predefined tasks and susceptibility to app updates. Recent advancements have utilized the view hierarchy to collect UI information and employed Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance task automation. However, view hierarchies have accessibility issues and face potential problems like missing object descriptions or misaligned structures. This paper introduces VisionTasker, a two-stage framework combining vision-based UI understanding and LLM task planning, for mobile task automation in a step-by-step manner. VisionTasker firstly converts a UI screenshot into natural language interpretations using a vision-based UI understanding approach, eliminating the need for view hierarchies. Secondly, it adopts a step-by-step task planning method, presenting one interface at a time to the LLM. The LLM then identifies relevant elements within the interface and determines the next action, enhancing accuracy and practicality. Extensive experiments show that VisionTasker outperforms previous methods, providing effective UI representations across four datasets. Additionally, in automating 147 real-world tasks on an Android smartphone, VisionTasker demonstrates advantages over humans in tasks where humans show unfamiliarity and shows significant improvements when integrated with the PBD mechanism. VisionTasker is open-source and available at https://github.com/AkimotoAyako/VisionTasker.</p></details> |  |
| **[When to Stop? Towards Efficient Code Generation in LLMs with Excess Token Prevention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20042v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets that meet given natural language requirements and plays an important role in software development. Although Code LLMs have shown excellent performance in this domain, their long generation time poses a signification limitation in practice use. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth preliminary study with different Code LLMs on code generation tasks and identify a significant efficiency issue, i.e., continual generation of excess tokens. It harms the developer productivity and leads to huge computational wastes. To address it, we introduce CodeFast, an inference acceleration approach for Code LLMs on code generation. The key idea of CodeFast is to terminate the inference process in time when unnecessary excess tokens are detected. First, we propose an automatic data construction framework to obtain training data. Then, we train a unified lightweight model GenGuard applicable to multiple programming languages to predict whether to terminate inference at the current step. Finally, we enhance Code LLM with GenGuard to accelerate its inference in code generation tasks. We conduct extensive experiments with CodeFast on five representative Code LLMs across four widely used code generation datasets. Experimental results show that (1) CodeFast can significantly improve the inference speed of various Code LLMs in code generation, ranging form 34% to 452%, without compromising the quality of generated code. (2) CodeFast is stable across different parameter settings and can generalize to untrained datasets.

OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents have revolutionised data engineering and have been applied creatively in many domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With consideration of several specific challenges in leveraging LLM agents for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM (w.r.t. Agent for Ontology Matching), consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve results very close to the long-standing best performance on simple OM tasks and can significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

An Ontology Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19998v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented prowess across various natural language processing tasks in various application domains. Recent studies show that LLMs can be leveraged to perform lexical semantic tasks, such as Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) or Ontology Learning (OL). However, it has not effectively been verified whether their success is due to their ability to reason over unstructured or semi-structured data, or their effective learning of linguistic patterns and senses alone. This unresolved question is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where the lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has learned during its training stage. This paper investigates the following question: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the extraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses instead of reasoning? To answer this question and, we devise a controlled experiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English and gibberish terms. We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each corpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery. Empirical results show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs do not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and instead leverage senses and their frame. However, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific terms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the applicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISWC 2024</p></details> |

However, these agents typically require elaborate design and expert prompts to solve tasks in specific domains, which limits their adaptability. We introduce AutoManual, a framework enabling LLM agents to autonomously build their understanding through interaction and adapt to new environments. AutoManual categorizes environmental knowledge into diverse rules and optimizes them in an online fashion by two agents: 1) The Planner codes actionable plans based on current rules for interacting with the environment. 2) The Builder updates the rules through a well-structured rule system that facilitates online rule management and essential detail retention. To mitigate hallucinations in managing rules, we introduce a case-conditioned prompting strategy for the Builder. Finally, the Formulator agent compiles these rules into a comprehensive manual. The self-generated manual can not only improve the adaptability but also guide the planning of smaller LLMs while being human-readable. Given only one simple demonstration, AutoManual significantly improves task success rates, achieving 97.4\% with GPT-4-turbo and 86.2\% with GPT-3.5-turbo on ALFWorld benchmark tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/minghchen/automanual.</p></details> |  |

In the context of this work, we highlight the use of LLMs for sentiment analysis (SA) and explainability. Specifically, we contribute a novel technique to leverage LLMs as a post-hoc model-independent tool for the explainability of SA. We applied our technique in the financial domain for currency-pair price predictions using open news feed data merged with market prices. Our application shows that the developed technique is not only a viable alternative to using conventional eXplainable AI but can also be fed back to enrich the input to the machine learning (ML) model to better predict future currency-pair values. We envision our results could be generalized to employing explainability as a conventional enrichment for ML input for better ML predictions in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, AIFin@ECAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Prompting Multi-Modal Tokens to Enhance End-to-End Autonomous Driving Imitation Learning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04869v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the realm of reinforcement learning, particularly as planners, has garnered a significant degree of attention in recent scholarly literature. However, a substantial proportion of existing research predominantly focuses on planning models for robotics that transmute the outputs derived from perception models into linguistic forms, thus adopting a `pure-language' strategy. In this research, we propose a hybrid End-to-End learning framework for autonomous driving by combining basic driving imitation learning with LLMs based on multi-modality prompt tokens. Instead of simply converting perception results from the separated train model into pure language input, our novelty lies in two aspects. 1) The end-to-end integration of visual and LiDAR sensory input into learnable multi-modality tokens, thereby intrinsically alleviating description bias by separated pre-trained perception models. 2) Instead of directly letting LLMs drive, this paper explores a hybrid setting of letting LLMs help the driving model correct mistakes and complicated scenarios. The results of our experiments suggest that the proposed methodology can attain driving scores of 49.21%, coupled with an impressive route completion rate of 91.34% in the offline evaluation conducted via CARLA. These performance metrics are comparable to the most advanced driving models.</p></details> |  |

However, this expansion raises security concerns. In this study, we propose a three-layer concern framework to identify the potential security risks of LLM apps, i.e., LLM apps with abusive potential, LLM apps with malicious intent, and LLM apps with exploitable vulnerabilities. Over five months, we collected 786,036 LLM apps from six major app stores: GPT Store, FlowGPT, Poe, Coze, Cici, and Character.AI. Our research integrates static and dynamic analysis, the development of a large-scale toxic word dictionary (i.e., ToxicDict) comprising over 31,783 entries, and automated monitoring tools to identify and mitigate threats. We uncovered that 15,146 apps had misleading descriptions, 1,366 collected sensitive personal information against their privacy policies, and 15,996 generated harmful content such as hate speech, self-harm, extremism, etc. Additionally, we evaluated the potential for LLM apps to facilitate malicious activities, finding that 616 apps could be used for malware generation, phishing, etc. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced enforcement mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, models require significant time to generate answers augmented with lengthy reasoning details. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the impact of output lengths on LLM inference pipelines and proposes novel metrics to evaluate them in terms of \textit{correct conciseness}. It also examines the impact of controlling output length through a refined prompt engineering strategy, Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages the model to limit output length. Experiments on pre-trained LLMs demonstrated the benefit of the proposed metrics and the effectiveness of CCoT across different models. For instance, constraining the reasoning of LLaMA2-70b to 100 words improves the accuracy from 36.01\% (CoT) to 41.07\% (CCoT) on the GSM8K dataset, while reducing the average output length by 28 words.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version, under review</p></details> |

However, research on the domain generalizability of deep learning models for vision-language tasks remains limited, primarily because of the lack of required datasets. To address these challenges, we propose VolDoGer: Vision-Language Dataset for Domain Generalization, a dedicated dataset designed for domain generalization that addresses three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual question answering, and visual entailment. We constructed VolDoGer by extending LLM-based data annotation techniques to vision-language tasks, thereby alleviating the burden of recruiting human annotators. We evaluated the domain generalizability of various models, ranging from fine-tuned models to a recent multimodal large language model, through VolDoGer.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 20 tables</p></details> |

We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.</p></details> | Accepted at AIES24 |
| **[Fine-Tuning, Quantization, and LLMs: Navigating Unintended Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04392v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become very popular and are used in many domains, such as chatbots, auto-task completion agents, and much more. However, LLMs suffer from many safety vulnerabilities, which can be exploited using different types of attacks, such as jailbreaking, prompt injection attacks, and privacy leakage attacks. These attacks can disrupt the working of the LLMs and make powerful LLM systems generate malicious or unethical content, take malicious actions, or leak confidential information by bypassing the security filters and taking advantage of their access. Foundational LLMs undergo alignment training, which includes safety training. This helps the model learn how to generate outputs that are ethical and aligned with human responses. Further, to make the models even safer, guardrails are added to filter the inputs received and the output generated by the model. These foundational LLMs are subjected to fine-tuning, quantization, or alteration of guardrails to use these models for specialized tasks or to use them in a resource-constrained environment. So, understanding the impact of modifications such as fine-tuning, quantization, and guardrails on the safety of LLM becomes an important question. Understanding and mitigating the consequences will help build reliable systems and effective strategies to make LLMs more secure. In this study, we tested foundational models like Mistral, Llama, MosaicML, and their finetuned versions. These comprehensive evaluations show that fine-tuning increases jailbreak attack success rates (ASR), quantization has a variable impact on the ASR, and guardrails can help significantly improve jailbreak resistance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods typically create simulation environments and rewards for specific tasks, resulting in the requirements of multiple policies and limited capabilities for tackling complex and unknown tasks. To overcome these issues, we present a novel approach that combines adversarial imitation learning with large language models (LLMs). This innovative method enables the agent to learn reusable skills with a single policy and solve zero-shot tasks under the guidance of LLMs. In particular, we utilize the LLM as a strategic planner for applying previously learned skills to novel tasks through the comprehension of task-specific prompts. This empowers the robot to perform the specified actions in a sequence. To improve our model, we incorporate codebook-based vector quantization, allowing the agent to generate suitable actions in response to unseen textual commands from LLMs. Furthermore, we design general reward functions that consider the distinct motion features of humanoid robots, ensuring the agent imitates the motion data while maintaining goal orientation without additional guiding direction approaches or policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that controls humanoid robots using a single learning policy network and LLM as a planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability in complicated motion tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional strategies, PPD employs additional compute resources to parallelize the initiation of subsequent token decoding during the current token decoding. This method reduces decoding latency and reshapes the understanding of trade-offs in LLM decoding strategies. We have developed a theoretical framework that allows us to analyze the trade-off between computation and latency. Using this framework, we can analytically estimate the potential reduction in latency associated with our proposed method, achieved through the assessment of the match rate, represented as p_correct. The results demonstrate that the use of extra computational resources has the potential to accelerate LLM decoding. Additionally, we implement PPD and conduct preliminary experiments to empirically validate its efficacy, addressing potential practical overheads not covered by theoretical analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ES-Fo...</summary><p>ES-FoMo Workshop at ICML 2023 / Published in TMLR</p></details> |

These persona agents offer significant enhancements across diverse sectors, such as education, healthcare, and entertainment, where model developers can align agent responses to different user requirements thereby broadening the scope of agent applications. However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents. Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5 despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention towards faithful and performant persona agents.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

This study explores the factors influencing the performance of LLMs in causal discovery tasks. Utilizing open-source LLMs, we examine how the frequency of causal relations within their pre-training corpora affects their ability to accurately respond to causal discovery queries. Our findings reveal that a higher frequency of causal mentions correlates with better model performance, suggesting that extensive exposure to causal information during training enhances the models' causal discovery capabilities. Additionally, we investigate the impact of context on the validity of causal relations. Our results indicate that LLMs might exhibit divergent predictions for identical causal relations when presented in different contexts. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of how different factors contribute to LLM performance in causal discovery tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs' Understanding of Natural Language Revealed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19630v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are the result of a massive experiment in bottom-up, data-driven reverse engineering of language at scale. Despite their utility in a number of downstream NLP tasks, ample research has shown that LLMs are incapable of performing reasoning in tasks that require quantification over and the manipulation of symbolic variables (e.g., planning and problem solving); see for example [25][26]. In this document, however, we will focus on testing LLMs for their language understanding capabilities, their supposed forte. As we will show here, the language understanding capabilities of LLMs have been widely exaggerated. While LLMs have proven to generate human-like coherent language (since that's how they were designed), their language understanding capabilities have not been properly tested. In particular, we believe that the language understanding capabilities of LLMs should be tested by performing an operation that is the opposite of 'text generation' and specifically by giving the LLM snippets of text as input and then querying what the LLM "understood". As we show here, when doing so it will become apparent that LLMs do not truly understand language, beyond very superficial inferences that are essentially the byproduct of the memorization of massive amounts of ingested text.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) offer potential solutions to this challenge. We present AgEval, a benchmark comprising 12 diverse plant stress phenotyping tasks, to evaluate these models' capabilities. Our study assesses zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning performance of state-of-the-art models, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA. Results show significant performance improvements with few-shot learning, with F1 scores increasing from 46.24% to 73.37% in 8-shot identification for the best-performing model. Few-shot examples from other classes in the dataset have negligible or negative impacts, although having the exact category example helps to increase performance by 15.38%. We also quantify the consistency of model performance across different classes within each task, finding that the coefficient of variance (CV) ranges from 26.02% to 58.03% across models, implying that subject matter expertise is needed - of 'difficult' classes - to achieve reliability in performance. AgEval establishes baseline metrics for multimodal LLMs in agricultural applications, offering insights into their promise for enhancing plant stress phenotyping at scale.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a common unsupervised approach that decomposes a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix to uncover latent topics and segment the dataset accordingly. While useful for highlighting patterns and clustering documents, NMF does not provide explicit topic labels, necessitating subject matter experts (SMEs) to assign labels manually. We present a methodology for automating topic labeling in documents clustered via NMF with automatic model determination (NMFk). By leveraging the output of NMFk and employing prompt engineering, we utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate topic labels. Our case study on over 34,000 scientific abstracts on Knowledge Graphs demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in enhancing knowledge management and document organization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Symposium on Document Engineering 2024 (DocEng 24), 2024</p></details> |

However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters, due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, we propose finding small mini-batches that simulate the dynamics of training with larger mini-batches. Specifically, we formulate selecting smaller mini-batches of examples that closely capture gradients of large mini-batches as a submodular maximization problem. Nevertheless, the very large dimensionality of the gradients makes the problem very challenging to solve. To address this, we leverage ideas from zeroth-order optimization and neural network pruning to find lower-dimensional gradient estimates that allow finding high-quality subsets effectively with a limited amount of memory. We prove the superior convergence rate of training on the small mini-batches found by our method and empirically show its effectiveness. Our method can effectively reduce the memory requirement by 2x and speed up training by 1.3x, as we confirm for fine-tuning Phi-2 on MathInstruct. Our method can be easily stacked with LoRA and other memory-efficient methods to further reduce the memory requirements of training LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are LLMs Good Annotators for Discourse-level Event Relation Extraction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19568v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning on Graphs with Large Language Models(LLMs): A Deep Dive into Model Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12068v2)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. Recently, several LLMs-based pipelines have been developed to enhance learning on graphs with text attributes, showcasing promising performance. However, graphs are well-known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks and it remains unclear whether LLMs exhibit robustness in learning on graphs. To address this gap, our work aims to explore the potential of LLMs in the context of adversarial attacks on graphs. Specifically, we investigate the robustness against graph structural and textual perturbations in terms of two dimensions: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. Through extensive experiments, we find that, compared to shallow models, both LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors offer superior robustness against structural and textual attacks.Based on these findings, we carried out additional analyses to investigate the underlying causes. Furthermore, we have made our benchmark library openly available to facilitate quick and fair evaluations, and to encourage ongoing innovative research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Decoding Methods on Human Alignment of Conversational LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19526v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To be included into chatbot systems, Large language models (LLMs) must be aligned with human conversational conventions. However, being trained mainly on web-scraped data gives existing LLMs a voice closer to informational text than actual human speech. In this paper, we examine the effect of decoding methods on the alignment between LLM-generated and human conversations, including Beam Search, Top K Sampling, and Nucleus Sampling. We present new measures of alignment in substance, style, and psychometric orientation, and experiment with two conversation datasets. Our results provide subtle insights: better alignment is attributed to fewer beams in Beam Search and lower values of P in Nucleus Sampling. We also find that task-oriented and open-ended datasets perform differently in terms of alignment, indicating the significance of taking into account the context of the interaction.</p></details> |  |

Our findings reveal that TPC-DS queries exhibit a significantly higher level of structural complexity compared to the other two benchmarks. This underscores the need for more intricate benchmarks to simulate realistic scenarios effectively. To facilitate this comparison, we devised several measures of structural complexity and applied them across all three benchmarks. The results of this study can guide future research in the development of more sophisticated text-to-SQL benchmarks. We utilized 11 distinct Language Models (LLMs) to generate SQL queries based on the query descriptions provided by the TPC-DS benchmark. The prompt engineering process incorporated both the query description as outlined in the TPC-DS specification and the database schema of TPC-DS. Our findings indicate that the current state-of-the-art generative AI models fall short in generating accurate decision-making queries. We conducted a comparison of the generated queries with the TPC-DS gold standard queries using a series of fuzzy structure matching techniques based on query features. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of the generated queries is insufficient for practical real-world application.</p></details> |  |

However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture' s struggle with handling long texts. KV-Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV-Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV-Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV-Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in CoLM 2024</p></details> |

An increasing number of industry professionals and researchers are adopting LLMs for program analysis tasks. However, one significant difference between programming languages and natural languages is that a programmer has the flexibility to assign any names to variables, methods, and functions in the program, whereas a natural language writer does not. Intuitively, the quality of naming in a program affects the performance of LLMs in program analysis tasks. This paper investigates how naming affects LLMs on code analysis tasks. Specifically, we create a set of datasets with code containing nonsense or misleading names for variables, methods, and functions, respectively. We then use well-trained models (CodeBERT) to perform code analysis tasks on these datasets. The experimental results show that naming has a significant impact on the performance of code analysis tasks based on LLMs, indicating that code representation learning based on LLMs heavily relies on well-defined names in code. Additionally, we conduct a case study on some special code analysis tasks using GPT, providing further insights.</p></details> | 3 Table, 8 figures |

LLM agents are now extensively applied across various domains, handling vast amounts of data to interact with humans and execute tasks. The widespread applications of LLM agents demonstrate their significant commercial value; however, they also expose security and privacy vulnerabilities. At the current stage, comprehensive research on the security and privacy of LLM agents is highly needed. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the newly emerged privacy and security issues faced by LLM agents. We begin by introducing the fundamental knowledge of LLM agents, followed by a categorization and analysis of the threats. We then discuss the impacts of these threats on humans, environment, and other agents. Subsequently, we review existing defensive strategies, and finally explore future trends. Additionally, the survey incorporates diverse case studies to facilitate a more accessible understanding. By highlighting these critical security and privacy issues, the survey seeks to stimulate future research towards enhancing the security and privacy of LLM agents, thereby increasing their reliability and trustworthiness in future applications.</p></details> |  |

However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance.

We study the optimal parallelization strategy of LLMs and propose a novel datacenter network design tailored to LLM's unique communication pattern. We show that LLM training generates sparse communication patterns in the network and, therefore, does not require any-to-any full-bisection network to complete efficiently. As a result, our design eliminates the spine layer in traditional GPU clusters. We name this design a Rail-only network and demonstrate that it achieves the same training performance while reducing the network cost by 38% to 77% and network power consumption by 37% to 75% compared to a conventional GPU datacenter. Our architecture also supports Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models with all-to-all communication through forwarding, with only 4.1% to 5.6% completion time overhead for all-to-all traffic. We study the failure robustness of Rail-only networks and provide insights into the performance impact of different network and training parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LoRA Adapters for LLMs on Clinical NLP Classification Under Data Limitations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19299v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to the domain gap and limited data availability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter techniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a resource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four structures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned biomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT, alongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results indicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant improvements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler Transformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource constraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to under 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are more suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and larger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler Transformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a viable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with limited data availability. By identifying the GRN as the most effective adapter structure, we offer a practical approach to enhance clinical note classification without requiring extensive computational resources.</p></details> | Under revisions |

In order to cleanly measure and disentangle memorisation from other phenomena (e.g. in-context learning), we create an experimental framework that is based on repeatedly exposing LLMs to random strings. Our framework allows us to better understand the dynamics, i.e., the behaviour of the model, when repeatedly exposing it to random strings. Using our framework, we make several striking observations: (a) we find consistent phases of the dynamics across families of models (Pythia, Phi and Llama2), (b) we identify factors that make some strings easier to memorise than others, and (c) we identify the role of local prefixes and global context in memorisation. We also show that sequential exposition to different random strings has a significant effect on memorisation. Our results, often surprising, have significant downstream implications in the study and usage of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental questions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how? By exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms, their properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users, as well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design, development, and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

We employed a novel persona-based approach to compare the educational background predictions of GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Claude 3 Sonnet with actual data from LinkedIn. The study focused on various roles at Microsoft, Meta, and Google, including VP Product, Director of Engineering, and Software Engineer. We generated 432 personas across the three LLMs and analyzed the frequency of elite universities (Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard) in these personas compared to LinkedIn data. Results showed that LLMs significantly overrepresented elite universities, featuring these universities 72.45% of the time, compared to only 8.56% in the actual LinkedIn data. ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited the highest bias, followed by Claude Sonnet 3, while Gemini performed best. This research highlights the need to address educational bias in LLMs and suggests strategies for mitigating such biases in AI-driven recruitment processes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 Figures |

We simplify the pruning process for Transformer-based LLMs by identifying a depth-2 pruning structure that functions independently. Additionally, we propose two inference-aware pruning criteria derived from the optimization perspective of output approximation, which outperforms traditional training-aware metrics such as gradient and Hessian. We also introduce a two-step reconstruction technique to mitigate pruning errors without model retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computational costs and hardware requirements while maintaining superior performance across various datasets and models.</p></details> |  |

While these apps extend the capabilities of LLM platforms, they are developed by arbitrary third parties and thus cannot be implicitly trusted. Apps also interface with LLM platforms and users using natural language, which can have imprecise interpretations. In this paper, we propose a framework that lays a foundation for LLM platform designers to analyze and improve the security, privacy, and safety of current and future third-party integrated LLM platforms. Our framework is a formulation of an attack taxonomy that is developed by iteratively exploring how LLM platform stakeholders could leverage their capabilities and responsibilities to mount attacks against each other. As part of our iterative process, we apply our framework in the context of OpenAI's plugin (apps) ecosystem. We uncover plugins that concretely demonstrate the potential for the types of issues that we outline in our attack taxonomy. We conclude by discussing novel challenges and by providing recommendations to improve the security, privacy, and safety of present and future LLM-based computing platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 7th AAAI / ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES), October 2024</p></details> |

However, traditional GUI testing techniques, such as random and model-based testing, primarily focus on generating test sequences that excel in achieving high code coverage but often fail to act as effective test oracles for non-crash functional (NCF) bug detection. To tackle these limitations, this study empirically investigates the capability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to be test oracles to detect NCF bugs in Android apps. Our intuition is that the training corpora of LLMs, encompassing extensive mobile app usage and bug report descriptions, enable them with the domain knowledge relevant to NCF bug detection. We conducted a comprehensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of LLMs as test oracles for detecting NCF bugs in Android apps on 71 well-documented NCF bugs. The results demonstrated that LLMs achieve a 49% bug detection rate, outperforming existing tools for detecting NCF bugs in Android apps. Additionally, by leveraging LLMs to be test oracles, we successfully detected 24 previously unknown NCF bugs in 64 Android apps, with four of these bugs being confirmed or fixed. However, we also identified limitations of LLMs, primarily related to performance degradation, inherent randomness, and false positives. Our study highlights the potential of leveraging LLMs as test oracles for Android NCF bug detection and suggests directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

Four widely-used test sets are employed to benchmark various base LLMs, comparing their translation quality and gender bias against state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English to Catalan (En $\rightarrow$ Ca) and English to Spanish (En $\rightarrow$ Es) translation directions. Our findings reveal pervasive gender bias across all models, with base LLMs exhibiting a higher degree of bias compared to NMT models. To combat this bias, we explore prompting engineering techniques applied to an instruction-tuned LLM. We identify a prompt structure that significantly reduces gender bias by up to 12% on the WinoMT evaluation dataset compared to more straightforward prompts. These results significantly reduce the gender bias accuracy gap between LLMs and traditional NMT systems.</p></details> |  |

As more datasets are published on OGD portals, finding specific data becomes harder, leading to information overload. Complete and accurate documentation of datasets, including association of proper tags with datasets is key to improving dataset findability and accessibility. Analysis conducted on the Estonian Open Data Portal, revealed that 11% datasets have no associated tags, while 26% had only one tag assigned to them, which underscores challenges in data findability and accessibility within the portal, which, according to the recent Open Data Maturity Report, is considered trend-setter. The aim of this study is to propose an automated solution to tagging datasets to improve data findability on OGD portals. This paper presents Tagify - a prototype of tagging interface that employs large language models (LLM) such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to automate dataset tagging, generating tags for datasets in English and Estonian, thereby augmenting metadata preparation by data publishers and improving data findability on OGD portals by data users. The developed solution was evaluated by users and their feedback was collected to define an agenda for future prototype improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, complex medical terminology poses unique challenges to achieving adequate translation quality and accuracy. This study introduces a novel "LLMs-in-the-loop" approach to develop supervised neural machine translation models optimized specifically for medical texts. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities, this research shows that small, specialized models trained on high-quality in-domain (mostly synthetic) data can outperform even vastly larger LLMs. Custom parallel corpora in six languages were compiled from scientific articles, synthetically generated clinical documents, and medical texts. Our LLMs-in-the-loop methodology employs synthetic data generation, rigorous evaluation, and agent orchestration to enhance performance. We developed small medical translation models using the MarianMT base model. We introduce a new medical translation test dataset to standardize evaluation in this domain. Assessed using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and BERT scores on this test set, our MarianMT-based models outperform Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-4-Turbo. Results demonstrate that our LLMs-in-the-loop approach, combined with fine-tuning high-quality, domain-specific data, enables specialized models to outperform general-purpose and some larger systems. This research, part of a broader series on expert small models, paves the way for future healthcare-related AI developments, including deidentification and bio-medical entity extraction models.

Intrigued by the claims of emergent planning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), works have been proposed to investigate the planning effectiveness of LLMs, without considering any utilization of off-the-shelf planning techniques in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to further study the insight of the planning capability of LLMs by investigating the roles of LLMs in off-the-shelf planning frameworks. To do this, we investigate the effectiveness of embedding LLMs into one of the well-known planning frameworks, graph-based planning, proposing a novel LLMs-based planning framework with LLMs embedded in two levels of planning graphs, i.e., mutual constraints generation level and constraints solving level. We empirically exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed framework in various planning domains.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing research, which primarily focuses on introductory classes and lacks in-depth analysis of actual student-LLM interactions, our work fills this gap. We conducted a comprehensive analysis involving 411 students from a Distributed Systems class at an Indian university, where they completed three programming assignments and shared their experiences through Google Form surveys. Our findings reveal that students leveraged LLMs for a variety of tasks, including code generation, debugging, conceptual inquiries, and test case creation. They employed a spectrum of prompting strategies, ranging from basic contextual prompts to advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and iterative refinement. While students generally viewed LLMs as beneficial for enhancing productivity and learning, we noted a concerning trend of over-reliance, with many students submitting entire assignment descriptions to obtain complete solutions. Given the increasing use of LLMs in the software industry, our study highlights the need to update undergraduate curricula to include training on effective prompting strategies and to raise awareness about the benefits and potential drawbacks of LLM usage in academic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review: 8 pages</p></details> |
| **[A Reliable Common-Sense Reasoning Socialbot Built Using LLMs and Goal-Directed ASP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18498v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has enabled the construction of several socialbots, like ChatGPT, that are receiving a lot of attention for their ability to simulate a human conversation. However, the conversation is not guided by a goal and is hard to control. In addition, because LLMs rely more on pattern recognition than deductive reasoning, they can give confusing answers and have difficulty integrating multiple topics into a cohesive response. These limitations often lead the LLM to deviate from the main topic to keep the conversation interesting. We propose AutoCompanion, a socialbot that uses an LLM model to translate natural language into predicates (and vice versa) and employs commonsense reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) to hold a social conversation with a human. In particular, we rely on s(CASP), a goal-directed implementation of ASP as the backend. This paper presents the framework design and how an LLM is used to parse user messages and generate a response from the s(CASP) engine output. To validate our proposal, we describe (real) conversations in which the chatbot's goal is to keep the user entertained by talking about movies and books, and s(CASP) ensures (i) correctness of answers, (ii) coherence (and precision) during the conversation, which it dynamically regulates to achieve its specific purpose, and (iii) no deviation from the main topic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05140v3)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Our research introduces an automated model-building process, traditionally reliant on intensive collaboration between data scientists and domain experts. We present two primary innovations: a taxonomy-guided prompting generation that facilitates the automatic creation of AI solution recipes and a set of LLM pipelines designed to produce a solution recipe containing a set of artifacts composed of documents, sample data, and models for IAM. These pipelines, guided by standardized principles, enable the generation of initial solution templates for heterogeneous asset classes without direct human input, reducing reliance on extensive domain knowledge and enhancing automation. We evaluate our methodology by assessing asset health and sustainability across a spectrum of ten asset classes. Our findings illustrate the potential of LLMs and taxonomy-based LLM prompting pipelines in transforming asset management, offering a blueprint for subsequent research and development initiatives to be integrated into a rapid client solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOLA: LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm for Content Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02611v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly evolving digital content landscape, media firms and news publishers require automated and efficient methods to enhance user engagement. This paper introduces the LLM-Assisted Online Learning Algorithm (LOLA), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with adaptive experimentation to optimize content delivery. Leveraging a large-scale dataset from Upworthy, which includes 17,681 headline A/B tests, we first investigate three pure-LLM approaches: prompt-based methods, embedding-based classification models, and fine-tuned open-source LLMs. We find that prompt-based approaches perform poorly, achieving no more than 65\% accuracy in identifying the catchier headline. In contrast, both OpenAI-embedding-based classification models and fine-tuned Llama-3 with 8 billion parameters achieve an accuracy of around 82-84\%. We then introduce LOLA, which combines the best pure-LLM approach with the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to allocate traffic and maximize clicks adaptively. Our numerical experiments on Upworthy data show that LOLA outperforms the standard A/B test method (the current status quo at Upworthy), pure bandit algorithms, and pure-LLM approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited experimental traffic. Our approach is scalable and applicable to content experiments across various settings where firms seek to optimize user engagement, including digital advertising and social media recommendations.</p></details> |  |

However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluate is debate, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>For c...</summary><p>For code please check: https://github.com/ucl-dark/llm_debate</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze student interactions with Jill across multiple courses and colleges, focusing on the types and complexity of student questions based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy and tool usage patterns. We find that, by supporting a wide range of cognitive demands, Jill encourages students to engage in sophisticated, higher-order cognitive questions. However, the frequency of usage varies significantly across deployments, and the types of questions asked depend on course-specific contexts. These findings pave the way for future work on AI-driven educational tools tailored to individual learning styles and course structure, potentially enhancing both the teaching and learning experience in classrooms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Seventeenth International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) Workshop: Leveraging LLMs for Next Generation Educational Technologies, July 2024</p></details> |
| **[Trust or Escalate: LLM Judges with Provable Guarantees for Human Agreement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18370v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a principled approach to provide LLM-based evaluation with a rigorous guarantee of human agreement. We first propose that a reliable evaluation method should not uncritically rely on model preferences for pairwise evaluation, but rather assess the confidence of judge models and selectively decide when to trust its judgement. We then show that under this selective evaluation framework, human agreement can be provably guaranteed -- such that the model evaluation aligns with that of humans to a user-specified agreement level. As part of our framework, we also introduce Simulated Annotators, a novel confidence estimation method that significantly improves judge calibration and thus enables high coverage of evaluated instances. Finally, we propose Cascaded Selective Evaluation, where we use cheaper models as initial judges and escalate to stronger models only when necessary -- again, while still providing a provable guarantee of human agreement. Experimental results show that Cascaded Selective Evaluation guarantees strong alignment with humans, far beyond what LLM judges could achieve without selective evaluation. For example, on a subset of Chatbot Arena where GPT-4 almost never achieves 80% human agreement, our method, even while employing substantially cost-effective models such as Mistral-7B, guarantees over 80% human agreement with almost 80% test coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: Two Faces of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03853v4)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, we have witnessed a rise in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in applications like chatbot assistants. Safety mechanisms and specialized training procedures are implemented to prevent improper responses from these assistants. In this work, we bypass these measures for ChatGPT and Gemini (and, to some extent, Bing chat) by making them impersonate complex personas with personality characteristics that are not aligned with a truthful assistant. We start by creating elaborate biographies of these personas, which we then use in a new session with the same chatbots. Our conversations then follow a role-play style to elicit prohibited responses. Using personas, we show that prohibited responses are actually provided, making it possible to obtain unauthorized, illegal, or harmful information. This work shows that by using adversarial personas, one can overcome safety mechanisms set out by ChatGPT and Gemini. We also introduce several ways of activating such adversarial personas, which show that both chatbots are vulnerable to this kind of attack. With the same principle, we introduce two defenses that push the model to interpret trustworthy personalities and make it more robust against such attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShiftAddLLM: Accelerating Pretrained LLMs via Post-Training Multiplication-Less Reparameterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05981v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity improvements of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3 and 2 bits, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM.</p></details> |  |

To the best of our knowledge this is the first completely model-agnostic and unsupervised method of measuring the robustness of any given response from an LLM, based upon the model itself conforming to a purely mathematical standard. To show general application and immediacy of results, we measure $\gamma$ in 10 popular LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude-2.1, Claude3.0, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Smaug-72B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B and MPT-7B) across thousands of queries in three objective domains: WebQA, ProgrammingQA, and TruthfulQA. Across all models and domains tested, human annotation confirms that $\gamma \to 0$ indicates trustworthiness, and conversely searching higher values of $\gamma$ easily exposes examples of hallucination, a fact that enables efficient adversarial prompt generation through stochastic gradient ascent in $\gamma$. The low-$\gamma$ leaders among the models in the respective domains are GPT-4o, GPT-4, and Smaug-72B, providing evidence that mid-size open-source models can win out against large commercial models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 16 tables; added Claude-3.0, GPT-4o, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and more annotation for other models</p></details> |

However, choosing the appropriate setting of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) is a labor-intensive and computationally expensive process. Here, we provide recommended HP configurations for practical use-cases that represent a better starting point for practitioners, when considering two SOTA LLMs and two commonly used tuning methods. We describe Coverage-based Search (CBS), a process for ranking HP configurations based on an offline extensive grid search, such that the top ranked configurations collectively provide a practical robust recommendation for a wide range of datasets and domains. We focus our experiments on Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B, as well as full fine-tuning and LoRa, conducting a total of > 10,000 tuning experiments. Our results suggest that, in general, Llama-3-8B and LoRA should be preferred, when possible. Moreover, we show that for both models and tuning methods, exploring only a few HP configurations, as recommended by our analysis, can provide excellent results in practice, making this work a valuable resource for practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Improved LLM Code-Generation via Budget Reallocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00725v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a common belief that large language models (LLMs) are better than smaller-sized ones. However, larger models also require significantly more time and compute during inference. This begs the question: what happens when both models operate under the same budget? (e.g., compute, run-time). To address this question, we analyze code generation LLMs of various sizes and make comparisons such as running a 70B model once vs. generating five outputs from a 13B model. We consider a standard unit-test setup, which can be used to select the correct output from the smaller model. Our findings reveal that the repeated use of smaller models can yield consistent improvements, with gains of up to 15% across five tasks. On the other hand, in scenarios where unit-tests are unavailable, a ranking-based selection of candidates from the smaller model falls short of the performance of a single output from larger ones. Our results highlight the potential of using smaller models instead of larger ones, and the importance of studying approaches for ranking LLM outputs.</p></details> | COLM 2024 |

To address this problem, we propose a method to utilize the state-of-the-art Whisper without modifying its architecture, preserving its generalization performance while enabling it to leverage descriptions effectively. Moreover, we propose two additional training techniques to improve the domain specific ASR: decoder fine-tuning, and context perturbation. We also propose a method to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate descriptions with simple metadata, when descriptions are unavailable. Our experiments demonstrate that proposed methods notably enhance domain-specific ASR accuracy on real-life datasets, with LLM-generated descriptions outperforming human-crafted ones in effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

LLM-based penetration testing is an essential step in automating system security evaluations by identifying vulnerabilities. Remediation, the subsequent crucial step, addresses these discovered vulnerabilities. Since details about vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and software versions offer crucial insights into system weaknesses, integrating penetration testing with vulnerability remediation into a cohesive system has become both intuitive and necessary. This paper introduces PenHeal, a two-stage LLM-based framework designed to autonomously identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. The framework integrates two LLM-enabled components: the Pentest Module, which detects multiple vulnerabilities within a system, and the Remediation Module, which recommends optimal remediation strategies. The integration is facilitated through Counterfactual Prompting and an Instructor module that guides the LLMs using external knowledge to explore multiple potential attack paths effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that PenHeal not only automates the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities but also significantly improves vulnerability coverage by 31%, increases the effectiveness of remediation strategies by 32%, and reduces the associated costs by 46% compared to baseline models. These outcomes highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in reshaping cybersecurity practices, offering an innovative solution to defend against cyber threats.</p></details> |  |

| **[CCoE: A Compact LLM with Collaboration of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11686v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of Large Language Model (LLM), LLMs demonstrate significant capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. With the growing needs of applying LLMs on various domains, it is a research question that how to efficiently train and build a model that has expertise in different domains but with a low training cost. We propose CCoE architecture, a framework of easily coupling multiple strong domain experts together to fuse into a big LLM, provides a collective way of utilizing the different domain expert LLMs. Besides, training a large collaborative of multiple expert LLMs requires a high requirements on training sources. CCoE bypasses this problem through isolating other experts and train each expert separately. The design of CCoE assembles multiple expert LLMs through the CoE (Collaboration of Experts) layer. Each CoE layer could have one or more expert LLMs. Expert LLMs have different number of layers and have been well-trained for different domain tasks. Each expert is fine-tuned to be able to achieve the comparable results with SOTA domain LLMs. We start from 5 experts in the domain of Code, Math, Law, text-to-SQL and Medical. The results indicate that our CCoE framework can easily and efficiently boost nearly 10%-20% performance on original base model in different domains but using less resources on training, as well as inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Training and Serving with Heterogeneous Context Sharding among Attention Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17678v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM training and inference frameworks struggle in boosting efficiency with sparsity while maintaining the integrity of context and model architecture. Inspired by the sharding concept in database and the fact that attention parallelizes over heads on accelerators, we propose Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention, an attention algorithm that allocates heterogeneous context partitions for different attention heads to divide and conquer. S2-Attention enforces each attention head to only attend to a partition of contexts following a strided sparsity pattern, while the full context is preserved as the union of all the shards. As attention heads are processed in separate thread blocks, the context reduction for each head can thus produce end-to-end speed-up and memory reduction. At inference, LLMs trained with S2-Attention can then take the KV cache reduction as free meals with guaranteed model quality preserve. In experiments, we show S2-Attentioncan provide as much as (1) 25.3X wall-clock attention speed-up over FlashAttention-2, resulting in 6X reduction in end-to-end training time and 10X inference latency, (2) on-par model training quality compared to default attention, (3)perfect needle retrieval accuracy over 32K context window. On top of the algorithm, we build DKernel, an LLM training and inference kernel library that allows users to customize sparsity patterns for their own models. We open-sourced DKerneland make it compatible with Megatron, Pytorch, and vLLM.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[AgentKit: Structured LLM Reasoning with Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11483v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an intuitive LLM prompting framework (AgentKit) for multifunctional agents. AgentKit offers a unified framework for explicitly constructing a complex "thought process" from simple natural language prompts. The basic building block in AgentKit is a node, containing a natural language prompt for a specific subtask. The user then puts together chains of nodes, like stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be designed to explicitly enforce a naturally structured "thought process". For example, for the task of writing a paper, one may start with the thought process of 1) identify a core message, 2) identify prior research gaps, etc. The nodes in AgentKit can be designed and combined in different ways to implement multiple advanced capabilities including on-the-fly hierarchical planning, reflection, and learning from interactions. In addition, due to the modular nature and the intuitive design to simulate explicit human thought process, a basic agent could be implemented as simple as a list of prompts for the subtasks and therefore could be designed and tuned by someone without any programming experience. Quantitatively, we show that agents designed through AgentKit achieve SOTA performance on WebShop and Crafter. These advances underscore AgentKit's potential in making LLM agents effective and accessible for a wider range of applications. https://github.com/holmeswww/AgentKit</p></details> |  |

Transfer learning can enable LLMs to acquire skills that were not targeted during pre-training. In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce WildHallucinations, a benchmark that evaluates factuality. It does so by prompting LLMs to generate information about entities mined from user-chatbot conversations in the wild. These generations are then automatically fact-checked against a systematically curated knowledge source collected from web search. Notably, half of these real-world entities do not have associated Wikipedia pages. We evaluate 118,785 generations from 15 LLMs on 7,919 entities. We find that LLMs consistently hallucinate more on entities without Wikipedia pages and exhibit varying hallucination rates across different domains. Finally, given the same base models, adding a retrieval component only slightly reduces hallucinations but does not eliminate hallucinations.</p></details> |  |

Misleading charts can distort the viewer's perception of data, leading to misinterpretations and decisions based on false information. The development of effective automatic detection methods for misleading charts is an urgent field of research. The recent advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models' analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments--from initial exploration to detailed analysis--we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy. This study demonstrates the applicability of LLMs in addressing the pressing concern of misleading charts.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at IEEE VIS 2024</p></details> |

The key to preventing such risks lies in understanding the causal chains behind risk contagion. Despite this, prevailing approaches primarily emphasize identifying risks, overlooking the underlying causal analysis of risk. To address such an issue, we propose a Risk Contagion Causal Reasoning model called RC2R, which uses the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to dissect the causal mechanisms of risk contagion grounded in the factual and expert knowledge embedded within financial knowledge graphs (KGs). At the data level, we utilize financial KGs to construct causal instructions, empowering LLMs to perform formal causal reasoning on risk propagation and tackle the "causal parrot" problem of LLMs. In terms of model architecture, we integrate a fusion module that aligns tokens and nodes across various granularities via multi-scale contrastive learning, followed by the amalgamation of textual and graph-structured data through soft prompt with cross multi-head attention mechanisms. To quantify risk contagion, we introduce a risk pathway inference module for calculating risk scores for each node in the graph. Finally, we visualize the risk contagion pathways and their intensities using Sankey diagrams, providing detailed causal explanations. Comprehensive experiments on financial KGs and supply chain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. We will make our dataset and code publicly accessible to encourage further research and development in this field.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the concept of Large Language Model Development Lifecycle (LDLC) and then highlight the importance of consistency test in ensuring the delivery quality. The principled solution of consistency test, however, is usually overlooked by industrial practitioners and not urgent in academia, and current practical solutions are insufficiently rigours and labor-intensive. We thus propose a simple yet effective consistency test protocol, named SimCT. SimCT is mainly to proactively check the consistency across different development stages of "bare metal" LLMs or associated services without accessing the model artifacts, in an attempt to expedite the delivery by reducing the back-and-forth alignment communications among multiple teams involved in different development stages. Specifically, SimCT encompasses response-wise and model-wise tests. We implement the protocol with LightGBM and Student's t-test for two components respectively, and perform extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of SimCT and the involved components.</p></details> |  |

Based on the AI-Gadget Kit we developed, this paper explores how to integrate LLM-driven agents within tabletop games to enable SUIs to execute complex interaction tasks. After defining the design space of this kit, we elucidate the method for designing agents that can extend the meta-actions of SUIs to complex motion planning. Furthermore, we introduce an add-on prompt method that simplifies the design process for four interaction behaviors and four interaction relationships in tabletop games. Lastly, we present several application scenarios that illustrate the potential of AI-Gadget Kit to construct personalized interaction in SUI tabletop games. We expect to use our work as a case study to inspire research on multi-agent-driven SUI for other scenarios with complex interaction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaLLM: A High-performant and Cost-efficient Dynamic Framework for Wrapping LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10834v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in machine learning (ML) has brought forth many large language models (LLMs) that excel in various tasks and areas. These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI's GPT models, Amazon's Titan, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's LLaMa, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions beyond classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

We thus develop SecLLMHolmes, a fully automated evaluation framework that performs the most detailed investigation to date on whether LLMs can reliably identify and reason about security-related bugs. We construct a set of 228 code scenarios and analyze eight of the most capable LLMs across eight different investigative dimensions using our framework. Our evaluation shows LLMs provide non-deterministic responses, incorrect and unfaithful reasoning, and perform poorly in real-world scenarios. Most importantly, our findings reveal significant non-robustness in even the most advanced models like `PaLM2' and `GPT-4': by merely changing function or variable names, or by the addition of library functions in the source code, these models can yield incorrect answers in 26% and 17% of cases, respectively. These findings demonstrate that further LLM advances are needed before LLMs can be used as general purpose security assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2024</p></details> |

We present Attentive Support, a novel interaction concept for robots to support a group of humans. It combines scene perception, dialogue acquisition, situation understanding, and behavior generation with the common-sense reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to following user instructions, Attentive Support is capable of deciding when and how to support the humans, and when to remain silent to not disturb the group. With a diverse set of scenarios, we show and evaluate the robot's attentive behavior, which supports and helps the humans when required, while not disturbing if no help is needed.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2024</p></details> |

Yet, this method is not always feasible due to large numbers of students per educator. Quantum computing serves as a prime example facing this issue, due to the hype surrounding it. Alleviating high workloads for teachers, often accompanied with individual teaching, is crucial for continuous high quality education. Therefore, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to generate educational content can be valuable. We conducted two complementary studies exploring the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automatically generate tips for students. In the first one students (N=46) solved four multiple-choice quantum computing questions with either the help of expert-created or LLM-generated tips. To correct for possible biases towards LLMs, we introduced two additional conditions, making some participants believe that they were given expert-created tips, when they were given LLM-generated tips and vice versa. Our second study (N=23) aimed to directly compare the LLM-generated and expert-created tips, evaluating their quality, correctness and helpfulness, with both experienced educators and students participating. Participants in our second study found that the LLM-generated tips were significantly more helpful and pointed better towards relevant concepts than the expert-created tips, while being more prone to be giving away the answer. While participants in the first study performed significantly better in answering the quantum computing questions when given tips labeled as LLM-generated, even if they were created by an expert. This phenomenon could be a placebo effect induced by the participants' biases for LLM-generated content. Ultimately, we find that LLM-generated tips are good enough to be used instead of expert tips in the context of quantum computing basics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SelfPiCo: Self-Guided Partial Code Execution with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16974v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code executability plays a vital role in software debugging and testing (e.g., detecting runtime exceptions or assertion violations). However, code execution, especially partial or arbitrary code execution, is a non-trivial task due to missing definitions and complex third-party dependencies. To make partial code (such as code snippets posted on the web or code fragments deep inside complex software projects) executable, the existing study has proposed a machine learning model to predict the undefined element types and inject the pre-defined dummy values into execution. However, the performance of their tool is limited due to its simply designed dummy values and the inability to continue learning. In this paper, we design and implement a novel framework, named SelfPiCo (Self Guided Partial Code Executor), to dynamically guide partial code execution by incorporating the open-source LLM (i.e., Code Llama) within an interactive loop. Particularly, SelfPiCo leverages few-shot in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to elicit human knowledge and logical reasoning based on fine-tuning the Code Llama model. SelfPiCo continuously learns from code execution results and refines its predictions step after step. Our evaluations demonstrate that SelfPiCo can execute 72.7% and 83.3% of all lines in the open-source code and Stack Overflow snippets, outperforming the most recent state-of-the-art Lexecutor by 37.9% and 33.5%, respectively. Moreover, SelfPiCo successfully detected 18 and 33 runtime type error issues by executing the partial code from eight GitHub software projects and 43 Stack Overflow posts, demonstrating the practical usage and potential application of our framework in practice.</p></details> | Accepted by ISSTA'24 |

Uncovering and analyzing the subpopulation distribution within datasets provides a comprehensive understanding of the datasets, standing as a powerful tool beneficial to various downstream tasks, including Dataset Subpopulation Organization, Subpopulation Shift, and Slice Discovery. Despite its importance, there has been no work that systematically explores the subpopulation distribution of datasets to our knowledge. To address the limitation and solve all the mentioned tasks in a unified way, we introduce a novel concept of subpopulation structures to represent, analyze, and utilize subpopulation distributions within datasets. To characterize the structures in an interpretable manner, we propose the Subpopulation Structure Discovery with Large Language Models (SSD-LLM) framework, which employs world knowledge and instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to linguistically analyze informative image captions and summarize the structures. Furthermore, we propose complete workflows to address downstream tasks, named Task-specific Tuning, showcasing the application of the discovered structure to a spectrum of subpopulation-related tasks, including dataset subpopulation organization, subpopulation shift, and slice discovery.

However, constructing full-life-cycle cyberattacks and performing red team emulations requires significant time and domain knowledge from security experts. Existing cyberattack simulation frameworks face challenges such as limited technical coverage, inability to conduct full-life-cycle attacks, and the need for manual infrastructure building. These limitations hinder the quality and diversity of the constructed attacks. In this paper, we leveraged the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in summarizing knowledge from existing attack intelligence and generating executable machine code based on human knowledge. we proposed AURORA, an automatic end-to-end cyberattack construction and emulation framework. AURORA can autonomously build multi-stage cyberattack plans based on Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, construct the emulation infrastructures, and execute the attack procedures. We also developed an attack procedure knowledge graph to integrate knowledge about attack techniques throughout the full life cycle of advanced cyberattacks from various sources. We constructed and evaluated more than 20 full-life-cycle cyberattacks based on existing CTI reports. Compared to previous attack simulation frameworks, AURORA can construct multi-step attacks and the infrastructures in several minutes without human intervention. Furthermore, AURORA incorporates a wider range (40% more) of attack techniques into the constructed attacks in a more efficient way than the professional red teams. To benefit further research, we open-sourced the dataset containing the execution files and infrastructures of 20 emulated cyberattacks.</p></details> |  |

The framework addresses critical limitations of current personalization solutions via cloud LLMs, such as privacy concerns, latency and cost, and limited personal information. To achieve this, we innovatively proposed deploying LLMs on smartphones with multimodal sensor data through context-aware sensing and customized prompt engineering, ensuring privacy and enhancing personalization performance. A case study involving a university student demonstrated the capability of the framework to provide tailored recommendations. In addition, we show that the framework achieves the best trade-off in privacy, performance, latency, cost, battery and energy consumption between on-device and cloud LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to provide on-device LLMs personalization with smartphone sensing. Future work will incorporate more diverse sensor data and involve extensive user studies to enhance personalization. Our proposed framework has the potential to substantially improve user experiences across domains including healthcare, productivity, and entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference demo paper</p></details> |

However, LLM-assisted approaches for HDL generation struggle when handling complex tasks. We introduce a suite of hierarchical prompting techniques which facilitate efficient stepwise design methods, and develop a generalizable automation pipeline for the process. To evaluate these techniques, we present a benchmark set of hardware designs which have solutions with or without architectural hierarchy. Using these benchmarks, we compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs, including our own fine-tuned Code Llama-Verilog model. Our hierarchical methods automatically produce successful designs for complex hardware modules that standard flat prompting methods cannot achieve, allowing smaller open-source LLMs to compete with large proprietary models. Hierarchical prompting reduces HDL generation time and yields savings on LLM costs. Our experiments detail which LLMs are capable of which applications, and how to apply hierarchical methods in various modes. We explore case studies of generating complex cores using automatic scripted hierarchical prompts, including the first-ever LLM-designed processor with no human feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MLCAD '24. 10 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16833v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced sufficiently, LC consistently outperforms RAG in terms of average performance. However, RAG's significantly lower cost remains a distinct advantage. Based on this observation, we propose Self-Route, a simple yet effective method that routes queries to RAG or LC based on model self-reflection. Self-Route significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining a comparable performance to LC. Our findings provide a guideline for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LC.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the application of LLMs in assisting teaching assistants (TAs) with viva and code assessments in an advanced computing class on distributed systems in an Indian University. We develop TAMIGO, an LLM-based system for TAs to evaluate programming assignments. For viva assessment, the TAs generated questions using TAMIGO and circulated these questions to the students for answering. The TAs then used TAMIGO to generate feedback on student answers. For code assessment, the TAs selected specific code blocks from student code submissions and fed it to TAMIGO to generate feedback for these code blocks. The TAMIGO-generated feedback for student answers and code blocks was used by the TAs for further evaluation. We evaluate the quality of LLM-generated viva questions, model answers, feedback on viva answers, and feedback on student code submissions. Our results indicate that LLMs are highly effective at generating viva questions when provided with sufficient context and background information. However, the results for LLM-generated feedback on viva answers were mixed; instances of hallucination occasionally reduced the accuracy of feedback. Despite this, the feedback was consistent, constructive, comprehensive, balanced, and did not overwhelm the TAs. Similarly, for code submissions, the LLM-generated feedback was constructive, comprehensive and balanced, though there was room for improvement in aligning the feedback with the instructor-provided rubric for code evaluation. Our findings contribute to understanding the benefits and limitations of integrating LLMs into educational settings.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09636v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.</p></details> |  |

These changes have significant implications for computer applications, including automatic translation and chatbots, making it essential to characterize them accurately. The recent development of LLMs has notably advanced natural language understanding, particularly in sense inference and reasoning. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs in characterizing three types of semantic change: dimension, relation, and orientation. We achieve this by combining LLMs' Chain-of-Thought with rhetorical devices and conducting an experimental assessment of our approach using newly created datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in capturing and analyzing semantic changes, providing valuable insights to improve computational linguistic applications.</p></details> |  |

This naturally raises the question of the similarity among the resulting models. In this paper, we propose a novel setting, imaginary question answering (IQA), to better understand model similarity. In IQA, we ask one model to generate purely imaginary questions (e.g., on completely made-up concepts in physics) and prompt another model to answer. Surprisingly, despite the total fictionality of these questions, all models can answer each other's questions with remarkable success, suggesting a "shared imagination space" in which these models operate during such hallucinations. We conduct a series of investigations into this phenomenon and discuss implications on model homogeneity, hallucination, and computational creativity.</p></details> |  |

Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, KaLLM workshop</p></details> |

Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Multi-Expert Adaptive Selection: Task-Balancing for All-in-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19139v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of a single image restoration framework to achieve multi-task image restoration has garnered significant attention from researchers. However, several practical challenges remain, including meeting the specific and simultaneous demands of different tasks, balancing relationships between tasks, and effectively utilizing task correlations in model design. To address these challenges, this paper explores a multi-expert adaptive selection mechanism. We begin by designing a feature representation method that accounts for both the pixel channel level and the global level, encompassing low-frequency and high-frequency components of the image. Based on this method, we construct a multi-expert selection and ensemble scheme. This scheme adaptively selects the most suitable expert from the expert library according to the content of the input image and the prompts of the current task. It not only meets the individualized needs of different tasks but also achieves balance and optimization across tasks. By sharing experts, our design promotes interconnections between different tasks, thereby enhancing overall performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the multi-expert mechanism effectively eliminates irrelevant experts, reducing interference from them and further improving the effectiveness and accuracy of image restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is both effective and superior to existing approaches, highlighting its potential for practical applications in multi-task image restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilated Strip Attention Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18613v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a long-standing task that seeks to recover the latent sharp image from its deteriorated counterpart. Due to the robust capacity of self-attention to capture long-range dependencies, transformer-based methods or some attention-based convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising results on many image restoration tasks in recent years. However, existing attention modules encounters limited receptive fields or abundant parameters. In order to integrate contextual information more effectively and efficiently, in this paper, we propose a dilated strip attention network (DSAN) for image restoration. Specifically, to gather more contextual information for each pixel from its neighboring pixels in the same row or column, a dilated strip attention (DSA) mechanism is elaborately proposed. By employing the DSA operation horizontally and vertically, each location can harvest the contextual information from a much wider region. In addition, we utilize multi-scale receptive fields across different feature groups in DSA to improve representation learning. Extensive experiments show that our DSAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on several image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RestoreAgent: Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18035v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Images in Adverse Weather Conditions via Histogram Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10172v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based image restoration methods in adverse weather have achieved significant progress. Most of them use self-attention along the channel dimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load. However, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range spatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced degradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this work, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring images affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed histogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into intensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each bin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process similar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram self-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional convolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor pixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear association and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose to leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce the recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our proposed method. We have released the codes in Github.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 10MB</p></details> |

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art inpainting methods are mainly designed for nature images and cannot correctly recover text within scene text images, and training existing models on the scene text images cannot fix the issues. In this work, we identify the visual-text inpainting task to achieve high-quality scene text image restoration and text completion: Given a scene text image with unknown missing regions and the corresponding text with unknown missing characters, we aim to complete the missing information in both images and text by leveraging their complementary information. Intuitively, the input text, even if damaged, contains language priors of the contents within the images and can guide the image inpainting. Meanwhile, the scene text image includes the appearance cues of the characters that could benefit text recovery. To this end, we design the cross-modal predictive interaction (CLII) model containing two branches, i.e., ImgBranch and TxtBranch, for scene text inpainting and text completion, respectively while leveraging their complementary effectively. Moreover, we propose to embed our model into the SOTA scene text spotting method and significantly enhance its robustness against missing pixels, which demonstrates the practicality of the newly developed task. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we construct three real datasets based on existing text-related datasets, containing 1838 images and covering three scenarios with curved, incidental, and styled texts, and conduct extensive experiments to show that our method outperforms baselines significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Prior-Based Amortized Variational Inference for Noisy Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16125v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on inverse problems have proposed posterior samplers that leverage the pre-trained diffusion models as powerful priors. These attempts have paved the way for using diffusion models in a wide range of inverse problems. However, the existing methods entail computationally demanding iterative sampling procedures and optimize a separate solution for each measurement, which leads to limited scalability and lack of generalization capability across unseen samples. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion prior-based Amortized Variational Inference (DAVI) that solves inverse problems with a diffusion prior from an amortized variational inference perspective. Specifically, instead of separate measurement-wise optimization, our amortized inference learns a function that directly maps measurements to the implicit posterior distributions of corresponding clean data, enabling a single-step posterior sampling even for unseen measurements. Extensive experiments on image restoration tasks, e.g., Gaussian deblur, 4$\times$ super-resolution, and box inpainting with two benchmark datasets, demonstrate our approach's superior performance over strong baselines.

| **[HPPP: Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point Algorithms and Applications to Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13120v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preconditioned Proximal Point (PPP) algorithms provide a unified framework for splitting methods in image restoration. Recent advancements with RED (Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a meaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically exhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to uncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type Preconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong convergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution. Based on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further introduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3 algorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a particular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image deblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it surpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffLoss: unleashing diffusion model as constraint for training image restoration network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19030v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to enhance low quality images, producing high quality images that exhibit natural visual characteristics and fine semantic attributes. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful technique for image generation, and it has been explicitly employed as a backbone in image restoration tasks, yielding excellent results. However, it suffers from the drawbacks of slow inference speed and large model parameters due to its intrinsic characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that implicitly leverages the diffusion model to assist the training of image restoration network, called DiffLoss, which drives the restoration results to be optimized for naturalness and semantic-aware visual effect. To achieve this, we utilize the mode coverage capability of the diffusion model to approximate the distribution of natural images and explore its ability to capture image semantic attributes. On the one hand, we extract intermediate noise to leverage its modeling capability of the distribution of natural images, which serves as a naturalness-oriented optimization space. On the other hand, we utilize the bottleneck features of diffusion model to harness its semantic attributes serving as a constraint on semantic level. By combining these two designs, the overall loss function is able to improve the perceptual quality of image restoration, resulting in visually pleasing and semantically enhanced outcomes. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on various common image restoration tasks and benchmarks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the visual quality and semantic perception of the restoration network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning CT Image Restoration using System Blur and Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14983v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The restoration of images affected by blur and noise has been widely studied and has broad potential for applications including in medical imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT). Although the blur and noise in CT images can be attributed to a variety of system factors, these image properties can often be modeled and predicted accurately and used in classical restoration approaches for deconvolution and denoising. In classical approaches, simultaneous deconvolution and denoising can be challenging and often represent competing goals. Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the potential to enhance image quality beyond classic limits; however, most deep learning models attempt a blind restoration problem and base their restoration on image inputs alone without direct knowledge of the image noise and blur properties. In this work, we present a method that leverages both degraded image inputs and a characterization of the system blur and noise to combine modeling and deep learning approaches. Different methods to integrate these auxiliary inputs are presented. Namely, an input-variant and a weight-variant approach wherein the auxiliary inputs are incorporated as a parameter vector before and after the convolutional block, respectively, allowing easy integration into any CNN architecture. The proposed model shows superior performance compared to baseline models lacking auxiliary inputs. Evaluations are based on the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), selected examples of good and poor performance for varying approaches, and an input space analysis to assess the effect of different noise and blur on performance. Results demonstrate the efficacy of providing a deep learning model with auxiliary inputs, representing system blur and noise characteristics, to enhance the performance of the model in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual High-Order Total Variation Model for Underwater Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14868v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater images are typically characterized by color cast, haze, blurring, and uneven illumination due to the selective absorption and scattering when light propagates through the water, which limits their practical applications. Underwater image enhancement and restoration (UIER) is one crucial mode to improve the visual quality of underwater images. However, most existing UIER methods concentrate on enhancing contrast and dehazing, rarely pay attention to the local illumination differences within the image caused by illumination variations, thus introducing some undesirable artifacts and unnatural color. To address this issue, an effective variational framework is proposed based on an extended underwater image formation model (UIFM). Technically, dual high-order regularizations are successfully integrated into the variational model to acquire smoothed local ambient illuminance and structure-revealed reflectance in a unified manner. In our proposed framework, the weight factors-based color compensation is combined with the color balance to compensate for the attenuated color channels and remove the color cast. In particular, the local ambient illuminance with strong robustness is acquired by performing the local patch brightest pixel estimation and an improved gamma correction. Additionally, we design an iterative optimization algorithm relying on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to accelerate the solution of the proposed variational model. Considerable experiments on three real-world underwater image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods with regard to visual quality and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the proposed method can also be extended to outdoor image dehazing, low-light image enhancement, and some high-level vision tasks.

Traditional video restoration methods often need retraining for different settings and struggle with limited generalization across various degradation types and datasets. Our approach uses a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames, combined with a hybrid correspondence mechanism that blends optical flow and feature-based nearest neighbor matching (latent merging). We show that our method not only achieves top performance in zero-shot video restoration but also significantly surpasses trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations (8$\times$ super-resolution and high-standard deviation video denoising). We present evidence through quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on various challenging datasets. Additionally, our technique works with any 2D restoration diffusion model, offering a versatile and powerful tool for video enhancement tasks without extensive retraining. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies, supporting advancements in fields that require high-quality video output.

However, existing models often require specific learning modules tailored for each degradation, resulting in complex architectures and high computation costs. Different from previous work, in this paper, we propose a unified manner to achieve joint embedding by leveraging the inherent similarities across various degradations for efficient and comprehensive restoration. Specifically, we first dig into the sub-latent space of each input to analyze the key components and reweight their contributions in a gated manner. The intrinsic awareness is further integrated with contextualized attention in an X-shaped scheme, maximizing local-global intertwining. Extensive comparison on benchmarking all-in-one restoration setting validates our efficiency and effectiveness, i.e., our network sets new SOTA records while reducing model complexity by approximately -82% in trainable parameters and -85\% in FLOPs.

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

Despite the notable achievement, existing methods predominantly focus on handling specific degradation types and thus require specialized models, impeding real-world applications in dynamic degradation scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Large Model Driven Image Restoration framework (LMDIR), a novel multiple-in-one image restoration paradigm that leverages the generic priors from large multi-modal language models (MMLMs) and the pretrained diffusion models. In detail, LMDIR integrates three key prior knowledges: 1) global degradation knowledge from MMLMs, 2) scene-aware contextual descriptions generated by MMLMs, and 3) fine-grained high-quality reference images synthesized by diffusion models guided by MMLM descriptions. Standing on above priors, our architecture comprises a query-based prompt encoder, degradation-aware transformer block injecting global degradation knowledge, content-aware transformer block incorporating scene description, and reference-based transformer block incorporating fine-grained image priors. This design facilitates single-stage training paradigm to address various degradations while supporting both automatic and user-guided restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our designed method outperforms state-of-the-art competitors on multiple evaluation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRIDS: Grouped Multiple-Degradation Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12273v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional single-task image restoration methods excel in handling specific degradation types but struggle with multiple degradations. To address this limitation, we propose Grouped Restoration with Image Degradation Similarity (GRIDS), a novel approach that harmonizes the competing objectives inherent in multiple-degradation restoration. We first introduce a quantitative method for assessing relationships between image degradations using statistical modeling of deep degradation representations. This analysis facilitates the strategic grouping of similar tasks, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of the restoration process. Based on the degradation similarity, GRIDS divides restoration tasks into one of the optimal groups, where tasks within the same group are highly correlated. For instance, GRIDS effectively groups 11 degradation types into 4 cohesive groups. Trained models within each group show significant improvements, with an average improvement of 0.09dB over single-task upper bound models and 2.24dB over the mix-training baseline model. GRIDS incorporates an adaptive model selection mechanism for inference, automatically selecting the appropriate grouped-training model based on the input degradation. This mechanism is particularly useful for real-world scenarios with unknown degradations as it does not rely on explicit degradation classification modules. Furthermore, our method can predict model generalization ability without the need for network inference, providing valuable insights for practitioners.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

An intuitive manifestation is that networks which excel in certain tasks often fail to deliver satisfactory results in others. To illustrate this point, we select five representative networks and conduct a comparative study on five classic image restoration tasks. First, we provide a detailed explanation of the characteristics of different image restoration tasks and backbone networks. Following this, we present the benchmark results and analyze the reasons behind the performance disparity of different models across various tasks. Drawing from this comparative study, we propose that a general image restoration backbone network needs to meet the functional requirements of diverse tasks. Based on this principle, we design a new general image restoration backbone network, X-Restormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Restormer possesses good task generality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to ECCV2024 |

Recognizing the limitations of traditional physical model-based methods and the inefficiencies of current attention-based solutions, we propose a new dehazing network combining an innovative Haze-Aware Attention Module (HAAM) with a Multiscale Frequency Enhancement Module (MFEM). The HAAM is inspired by the atmospheric scattering model, thus skillfully integrating physical principles into high-dimensional features for targeted dehazing. It picks up on latent features during the image restoration process, which gives a significant boost to the metrics, while the MFEM efficiently enhances high-frequency details, thus sidestepping wavelet or Fourier transform complexities. It employs multiscale fields to extract and emphasize key frequency components with minimal parameter overhead. Integrated into a simple U-Net framework, our Haze-Aware Attention Network (HAA-Net) for single-image dehazing significantly outperforms existing attention-based and transformer models in efficiency and effectiveness. Tested across various public datasets, the HAA-Net sets new performance benchmarks. Our work not only advances the field of image dehazing but also offers insights into the design of attention mechanisms for broader applications in computer vision.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, it still remains an open research problem to adopt this language-vision paradigm for more fine-level image processing tasks, such as denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and compression artifact removal. In this paper, we develop SPIRE, a Semantic and restoration Prompt-driven Image Restoration framework that leverages natural language as a user-friendly interface to control the image restoration process. We consider the capacity of prompt information in two dimensions. First, we use content-related prompts to enhance the semantic alignment, effectively alleviating identity ambiguity in the restoration outcomes. Second, our approach is the first framework that supports fine-level instruction through language-based quantitative specification of the restoration strength, without the need for explicit task-specific design. In addition, we introduce a novel fusion mechanism that augments the existing ControlNet architecture by learning to rescale the generative prior, thereby achieving better restoration fidelity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior restoration performance of SPIRE compared to the state of the arts, alongside offering the flexibility of text-based control over the restoration effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024; Webpage: https://chenyangqiqi.github.io/tip</p></details> |
| **[In-Loop Filtering via Trained Look-Up Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10926v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology for removing the artifacts in image/video coding standards. Recently, neural network-based in-loop filtering methods achieve remarkable coding gains beyond the capability of advanced video coding standards, which becomes a powerful coding tool candidate for future video coding standards. However, the utilization of deep neural networks brings heavy time and computational complexity, and high demands of high-performance hardware, which is challenging to apply to the general uses of coding scene. To address this limitation, inspired by explorations in image restoration, we propose an efficient and practical in-loop filtering scheme by adopting the Look-up Table (LUT). We train the DNN of in-loop filtering within a fixed filtering reference range, and cache the output values of the DNN into a LUT via traversing all possible inputs. At testing time in the coding process, the filtered pixel is generated by locating input pixels (to-be-filtered pixel with reference pixels) and interpolating cached filtered pixel values. To further enable the large filtering reference range with the limited storage cost of LUT, we introduce the enhanced indexing mechanism in the filtering process, and clipping/finetuning mechanism in the training. The proposed method is implemented into the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) reference software, VTM-11.0. Experimental results show that the ultrafast, very fast, and fast mode of the proposed method achieves on average 0.13%/0.34%/0.51%, and 0.10%/0.27%/0.39% BD-rate reduction, under the all intra (AI) and random access (RA) configurations. Especially, our method has friendly time and computational complexity, only 101%/102%-104%/108% time increase with 0.13-0.93 kMACs/pixel, and only 164-1148 KB storage cost for a single model. Our solution may shed light on the journey of practical neural network-based coding tool evolution.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This intends to handle two pivotal challenges in the existing CIR methods: (i) lacking adaptability and universality for different image codecs, e.g., JPEG and WebP; (ii) poor texture generation capability, particularly at low bitrates. Specifically, our MoE-DiffIR develops the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) prompt module, where some basic prompts cooperate to excavate the task-customized diffusion priors from Stable Diffusion (SD) for each compression task. Moreover, the degradation-aware routing mechanism is proposed to enable the flexible assignment of basic prompts. To activate and reuse the cross-modality generation prior of SD, we design the visual-to-text adapter for MoE-DiffIR, which aims to adapt the embedding of low-quality images from the visual domain to the textual domain as the textual guidance for SD, enabling more consistent and reasonable texture generation. We also construct one comprehensive benchmark dataset for universal CIR, covering 21 types of degradations from 7 popular traditional and learned codecs. Extensive experiments on universal CIR have demonstrated the excellent robustness and texture restoration capability of our proposed MoE-DiffIR.

Among them, the blind spot network based methods are the most typical type and have attracted the attentions of a large number of researchers. Although the introduction of blind spot operations can prevent identity mapping from noise to noise, it imposes stringent requirements on the receptive fields in the network design, thereby limiting overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a single mask scheme for self-supervised denoising training, which eliminates the need for blind spot operation and thereby removes constraints on the network structure design. Furthermore, to achieve denoising across entire image during inference, we propose a multi-mask scheme. Our method, featuring the asymmetric mask scheme in training and inference, achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing real noisy image datasets.

The recent advent of RWKV in the NLP field has attracted much attention as it can process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration.

Common models involve several stages of data resampling, in which the resolution of feature maps is first reduced to aggregate information and then increased to generate a high-resolution output. Previous works have shown that resampling operations are subject to artifacts such as aliasing. During downsampling, aliases have been shown to compromise the prediction stability of image classifiers. During upsampling, they have been leveraged to detect generated content. Yet, the effect of aliases during upsampling has not yet been discussed w.r.t. the stability and robustness of pixel-wise predictions. While falling under the same term (aliasing), the challenges for correct upsampling in neural networks differ significantly from those during downsampling: when downsampling, some high frequencies can not be correctly represented and have to be removed to avoid aliases. However, when upsampling for pixel-wise predictions, we actually require the model to restore such high frequencies that can not be encoded in lower resolutions. The application of findings from signal processing is therefore a necessary but not a sufficient condition to achieve the desirable output. In contrast, we find that the availability of large spatial context during upsampling allows to provide stable, high-quality pixel-wise predictions, even when fully learning all filter weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution.

Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.20106</p></details> |

Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking.

| **[Haar Nuclear Norms with Applications to Remote Sensing Imagery Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08509v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image restoration aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted areas within images. To date, low-rank based models have garnered significant interest in this field. This paper proposes a novel low-rank regularization term, named the Haar nuclear norm (HNN), for efficient and effective remote sensing image restoration. It leverages the low-rank properties of wavelet coefficients derived from the 2-D frontal slice-wise Haar discrete wavelet transform, effectively modeling the low-rank prior for separated coarse-grained structure and fine-grained textures in the image. Experimental evaluations conducted on hyperspectral image inpainting, multi-temporal image cloud removal, and hyperspectral image denoising have revealed the HNN's potential. Typically, HNN achieves a performance improvement of 1-4 dB and a speedup of 10-28x compared to some state-of-the-art methods (e.g., tensor correlated total variation, and fully-connected tensor network) for inpainting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, based on our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method, known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants.

| **[Aging-Resistant Wideband Precoding in 5G and Beyond Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07434v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates, 5G and 6G technologies are shifting transceivers to higher carrier frequencies, to support wider bandwidths and more antenna elements. Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Pixel-Aware Stable Diffusion for Realistic Image Super-resolution and Personalized Stylization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14469v4)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in various image generation, editing, enhancement and translation tasks. In particular, the pre-trained text-to-image stable diffusion models provide a potential solution to the challenging realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) and image stylization problems with their strong generative priors. However, the existing methods along this line often fail to keep faithful pixel-wise image structures. If extra skip connections between the encoder and the decoder of a VAE are used to reproduce details, additional training in image space will be required, limiting the application to tasks in latent space such as image stylization. In this work, we propose a pixel-aware stable diffusion (PASD) network to achieve robust Real-ISR and personalized image stylization. Specifically, a pixel-aware cross attention module is introduced to enable diffusion models perceiving image local structures in pixel-wise level, while a degradation removal module is used to extract degradation insensitive features to guide the diffusion process together with image high level information. An adjustable noise schedule is introduced to further improve the image restoration results. By simply replacing the base diffusion model with a stylized one, PASD can generate diverse stylized images without collecting pairwise training data, and by shifting the base model with an aesthetic one, PASD can bring old photos back to life. Extensive experiments in a variety of image enhancement and stylization tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PASD approach.

In this research, we introduce a multi-scale generative model that enhances conditional image restoration through a novel exploitation of the Brownian Bridge process within wavelet domain. By initiating the Brownian Bridge diffusion process specifically at the lowest-frequency subband and applying generative adversarial networks at subsequent multi-scale high-frequency subbands in the wavelet domain, our method provides significant acceleration during training and sampling while sustaining a high image generation quality and diversity on par with SOTA diffusion models. Experimental results on various computational microscopy and imaging tasks confirm our method's robust performance and its considerable reduction in its sampling steps and time. This pioneering technique offers an efficient image restoration framework that harmonizes efficiency with quality, signifying a major stride in incorporating cutting-edge generative models into computational microscopy workflows.</p></details> |  |

Our solution is robust against black-box attacking and well-established generative adversarial network (GAN) based image restoration. We analyze the potential risk in previous work, where the proposed cosine similarity computation might directly leak the protected precomputed embedding stored on the server side. We propose a Function Secret Sharing (FSS) based face embedding comparison protocol without any intermediate result leakage. In addition, we show in experiments that the proposed protocol is more efficient compared to the Secret Sharing (SS) based protocol.</p></details> | Accepted at ICIP2024 |

Adversarial attacks such as the seminal projected gradient descent (PGD) offer an effective means to evaluate a model's robustness and dedicated solutions have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation. While they attempt to increase the attack's efficiency, a further objective is to balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack's overall efficiency. To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model's robustness for semantic segmentation as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2024</p></details> |

| **[Diff-Restorer: Unleashing Visual Prompts for Diffusion-based Universal Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03636v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a classic low-level problem aimed at recovering high-quality images from low-quality images with various degradations such as blur, noise, rain, haze, etc. However, due to the inherent complexity and non-uniqueness of degradation in real-world images, it is challenging for a model trained for single tasks to handle real-world restoration problems effectively. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of realism in the restored results. To address these issues, we propose Diff-Restorer, a universal image restoration method based on the diffusion model, aiming to leverage the prior knowledge of Stable Diffusion to remove degradation while generating high perceptual quality restoration results. Specifically, we utilize the pre-trained visual language model to extract visual prompts from degraded images, including semantic and degradation embeddings. The semantic embeddings serve as content prompts to guide the diffusion model for generation. In contrast, the degradation embeddings modulate the Image-guided Control Module to generate spatial priors for controlling the spatial structure of the diffusion process, ensuring faithfulness to the original image. Additionally, we design a Degradation-aware Decoder to perform structural correction and convert the latent code to the pixel domain. We conducted comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis on restoration tasks with different degradations, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MRIR: Integrating Multimodal Insights for Diffusion-based Realistic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03635v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, and the use of diffusion-based models for image restoration has garnered significant attention due to their ability to produce realistic results. However, the quality of the generated images is still a significant challenge due to the severity of image degradation and the uncontrollability of the diffusion model. In this work, we delve into the potential of utilizing pre-trained stable diffusion for image restoration and propose MRIR, a diffusion-based restoration method with multimodal insights. Specifically, we explore the problem from two perspectives: textual level and visual level. For the textual level, we harness the power of the pre-trained multimodal large language model to infer meaningful semantic information from low-quality images. Furthermore, we employ the CLIP image encoder with a designed Refine Layer to capture image details as a supplement. For the visual level, we mainly focus on the pixel level control. Thus, we utilize a Pixel-level Processor and ControlNet to control spatial structures. Finally, we integrate the aforementioned control information into the denoising U-Net using multi-level attention mechanisms and realize controllable image restoration with multimodal insights. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate our method's superiority over other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Video Restoration and Enhancement Using Pre-Trained Image Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01960v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration and enhancement models have achieved great success in various image restoration and enhancement tasks without training. However, directly applying them to video restoration and enhancement results in severe temporal flickering artifacts. In this paper, we propose the first framework for zero-shot video restoration and enhancement based on a pre-trained image diffusion model. By replacing the self-attention layer with the proposed cross-previous-frame attention layer, the pre-trained image diffusion model can take advantage of the temporal correlation between neighboring frames. We further propose temporal consistency guidance, spatial-temporal noise sharing, and an early stopping sampling strategy for better temporally consistent sampling. Our method is a plug-and-play module that can be inserted into any diffusion-based zero-shot image restoration or enhancement methods to further improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in producing temporally consistent videos with better fidelity.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Improving Diffusion Inverse Problem Solving with Decoupled Noise Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01521v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently achieved success in solving Bayesian inverse problems with learned data priors. Current methods build on top of the diffusion sampling process, where each denoising step makes small modifications to samples from the previous step. However, this process struggles to correct errors from earlier sampling steps, leading to worse performance in complicated nonlinear inverse problems, such as phase retrieval. To address this challenge, we propose a new method called Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) that relies on a novel noise annealing process. Specifically, we decouple consecutive steps in a diffusion sampling trajectory, allowing them to vary considerably from one another while ensuring their time-marginals anneal to the true posterior as we reduce noise levels. This approach enables the exploration of a larger solution space, improving the success rate for accurate reconstructions. We demonstrate that DAPS significantly improves sample quality and stability across multiple image restoration tasks, particularly in complicated nonlinear inverse problems. For example, we achieve a PSNR of 30.72dB on the FFHQ 256 dataset for phase retrieval, which is an improvement of 9.12dB compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Inversion using Latent Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01027v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems due to their exceptional ability to model complex prior distributions. However, existing methods predominantly assume known forward operators (i.e., non-blind), limiting their applicability in practical settings where acquiring such operators is costly. Additionally, many current approaches rely on pixel-space diffusion models, leaving the potential of more powerful latent diffusion models (LDMs) underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LatentDEM, an innovative technique that addresses more challenging blind inverse problems using latent diffusion priors. At the core of our method is solving blind inverse problems within an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework: (1) the E-step recovers clean images from corrupted observations using LDM priors and a known forward model, and (2) the M-step estimates the forward operator based on the recovered images. Additionally, we propose two novel optimization techniques tailored for LDM priors and EM frameworks, yielding more accurate and efficient blind inversion results. As a general framework, LatentDEM supports both linear and non-linear inverse problems. Beyond common 2D image restoration tasks, it enables new capabilities in non-linear 3D inverse rendering problems. We validate LatentDEM's performance on representative 2D blind deblurring and 3D sparse-view reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its superior efficacy over prior arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Frequency-Aware Dynamic Transformers for All-In-One Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01636v1)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to tackle the all-in-one image restoration task, which seeks to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation types. Recognizing that various degradations affect image content differently across frequency bands, we propose a new all-in-one image restoration approach from a frequency perspective, leveraging advanced vision transformers. Our method consists of two main components: a frequency-aware Degradation prior learning transformer (Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by decomposing inputs into different frequency components. By understanding how degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods on four representative restoration tasks, including denoising, deraining, dehazing and deblurring. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling spatially variant degradations and unseen degradation levels.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. Rather than popular feature adaptation methods, we propose weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we figure out task-sensitive weights via a toy experiment and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. Further, we propose to maneuver Instruct-IPT with text instructions for better user interfaces. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

In this paper, we focus on the task of all-in-one medical image restoration, aiming to address multiple distinct MedIR tasks with a single universal model. Nonetheless, due to significant differences between different MedIR tasks, training a universal model often encounters task interference issues, where different tasks with shared parameters may conflict with each other in the gradient update direction. This task interference leads to deviation of the model update direction from the optimal path, thereby affecting the model's performance. To tackle this issue, we propose a task-adaptive routing strategy, allowing conflicting tasks to select different network paths in spatial and channel dimensions, thereby mitigating task interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed \textbf{A}ll-in-one \textbf{M}edical \textbf{I}mage \textbf{R}estoration (\textbf{AMIR}) network achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis, both in single-task and all-in-one settings.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise-space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how the multi-step denoising process is influenced by auxiliary conditional inputs, we obtain meaningful gradients from noise prediction to gradually align the restored results of both synthetic and real-world data to a common clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during training, we present useful techniques such as channel shuffling and residual-swapping contrastive learning. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The joint training process of IRConStyle, an Image Restoration framework consisting of ConStyle and a general restoration network, is divided into two stages: first, pre-training ConStyle alone, and then freezing its weights to guide the training of the general restoration network. Three improvements are proposed in the pre-training stage to train ConStyle: unsupervised pre-training, adding a pretext task (i.e. classification), and adopting knowledge distillation. Without bells and whistles, we can get ConStyle v2, a strong prompter for all-in-one Image Restoration, in less than two GPU days and doesn't require any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on Restormer (transformer-based), NAFNet (CNN-based), MAXIM-1S (MLP-based), and a vanilla CNN network demonstrate that ConStyle v2 can enhance any U-Net style Image Restoration models to all-in-one Image Restoration models. Furthermore, models guided by the well-trained ConStyle v2 exhibit superior performance in some specific degradation compared to ConStyle.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFDNet: Multi-Frequency Deflare Network for Efficient Nighttime Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18079v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When light is scattered or reflected accidentally in the lens, flare artifacts may appear in the captured photos, affecting the photos' visual quality. The main challenge in flare removal is to eliminate various flare artifacts while preserving the original content of the image. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight Multi-Frequency Deflare Network (MFDNet) based on the Laplacian Pyramid. Our network decomposes the flare-corrupted image into low and high-frequency bands, effectively separating the illumination and content information in the image. The low-frequency part typically contains illumination information, while the high-frequency part contains detailed content information. So our MFDNet consists of two main modules: the Low-Frequency Flare Perception Module (LFFPM) to remove flare in the low-frequency part and the Hierarchical Fusion Reconstruction Module (HFRM) to reconstruct the flare-free image. Specifically, to perceive flare from a global perspective while retaining detailed information for image restoration, LFFPM utilizes Transformer to extract global information while utilizing a convolutional neural network to capture detailed local features. Then HFRM gradually fuses the outputs of LFFPM with the high-frequency component of the image through feature aggregation. Moreover, our MFDNet can reduce the computational cost by processing in multiple frequency bands instead of directly removing the flare on the input image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing nighttime flare on real-world and synthetic images from the Flare7K dataset. Furthermore, the computational complexity of our model is remarkably low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Visual Computer journal</p></details> |

Recently, DIP is utilized in unsupervised dynamic MRI reconstruction, which adopts a generative model from the latent space to the image space. However, existing methods usually use a pyramid-shaped CNN generator shared by all frames, embedding the temporal modeling within the latent space, which may hamper the model expression capability. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic MRI representation, named ``Graph Image Prior'' (GIP). GIP adopts a two-stage generative network in a new modeling methodology, which first employs independent CNNs to recover the image structure for each frame, and then exploits the spatio-temporal correlations within the feature space parameterized by a graph model. A graph convolutional network is utilized for feature fusion and dynamic image generation. In addition, we devise an ADMM algorithm to alternately optimize the images and the network parameters to improve the reconstruction performance. Experiments were conducted on cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, which demonstrate that GIP outperforms compressed sensing methods and other DIP-based unsupervised methods, significantly reducing the performance gap with state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Moreover, GIP displays superior generalization ability when transferred to a different reconstruction setting, without the need for any additional data.</p></details> |  |
| **[DaLPSR: Leverage Degradation-Aligned Language Prompt for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16477v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image super-resolution pursuits reconstructing high-fidelity high-resolution counterpart for low-resolution image. In recent years, diffusion-based models have garnered significant attention due to their capabilities with rich prior knowledge. The success of diffusion models based on general text prompts has validated the effectiveness of textual control in the field of text2image. However, given the severe degradation commonly presented in low-resolution images, coupled with the randomness characteristics of diffusion models, current models struggle to adequately discern semantic and degradation information within severely degraded images. This often leads to obstacles such as semantic loss, visual artifacts, and visual hallucinations, which pose substantial challenges for practical use. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to leverage degradation-aligned language prompt for accurate, fine-grained, and high-fidelity image restoration. Complementary priors including semantic content descriptions and degradation prompts are explored. Specifically, on one hand, image-restoration prompt alignment decoder is proposed to automatically discern the degradation degree of LR images, thereby generating beneficial degradation priors for image restoration. On the other hand, much richly tailored descriptions from pretrained multimodal large language model elicit high-level semantic priors closely aligned with human perception, ensuring fidelity control for image restoration. Comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have been done on several popular synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. The quantitative and qualitative analysis have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art perceptual quality level, especially in real-world cases based on reference-free metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIR: A Lightweight Baseline for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01368v3)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant advancements in Image Restoration based on CNN and transformer. However, the inherent characteristics of the Image Restoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to focus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model, leading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the efficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently restore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious structural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and global residual connections that are ignored by modern networks. Then, a Lightweight Adaptive Attention (LAA) Block is introduced which is mainly composed of proposed Adaptive Filters and Attention Blocks. The proposed Adaptive Filter is used to adaptively extract high-frequency information and enhance object contours in various IR tasks, and Attention Block involves a novel Patch Attention module to approximate the self-attention part of the transformer. On the deraining task, our LIR achieves the state-of-the-art Structure Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and comparable performance to state-of-the-art models on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). For denoising, dehazing, and deblurring tasks, LIR also achieves a comparable performance to state-of-the-art models with a parameter size of about 30\%. In addition, it is worth noting that our LIR produces better visual results that are more in line with the human aesthetic.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we construct UHD snow and rain benchmarks, named UHD-Snow and UHD-Rain, to remedy the deficiency in this field. The UHD-Snow/UHD-Rain is established by simulating the physics process of rain/snow into consideration and each benchmark contains 3200 degraded/clear image pairs of 4K resolution. Furthermore, we propose an effective UHD image restoration solution by considering gradient and normal priors in model design thanks to these priors' spatial and detail contributions. Specifically, our method contains two branches: (a) feature fusion and reconstruction branch in high-resolution space and (b) prior feature interaction branch in low-resolution space. The former learns high-resolution features and fuses prior-guided low-resolution features to reconstruct clear images, while the latter utilizes normal and gradient priors to mine useful spatial features and detail features to guide high-resolution recovery better. To better utilize these priors, we introduce single prior feature interaction and dual prior feature interaction, where the former respectively fuses normal and gradient priors with high-resolution features to enhance prior ones, while the latter calculates the similarity between enhanced prior ones and further exploits dual guided filtering to boost the feature interaction of dual priors. We conduct experiments on both new and existing public datasets and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on UHD image low-light enhancement, UHD image desonwing, and UHD image deraining.

| **[Image Restoration Using Deep Regulated Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08853v2)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the depth of convolutional neural networks has attracted substantial attention in the deep learning research, the width of these networks has recently received greater interest. The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

However, these methods often struggle with overfitting and lack interpretability. In this paper, we explore an alternative clustering approach based on deep unfolding. By unfolding iterative optimization methods into neural networks, this approach offers enhanced interpretability and reliability compared to data-driven deep learning methods, and greater adaptability and generalization than model-based approaches. Hence, unfolding has become widely used in inverse imaging problems, such as image restoration, reconstruction, and super-resolution, but has not been sufficiently explored yet in the context of clustering. In this work, we introduce an innovative clustering architecture for hyperspectral images (HSI) by unfolding an iterative solver based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for sparse subspace clustering. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply unfolding ADMM for computing the self-representation matrix in subspace clustering. Moreover, our approach captures well the structural characteristics of HSI data by employing the K nearest neighbors algorithm as part of a structure preservation module. Experimental evaluation of three established HSI datasets shows clearly the potential of the unfolding approach in HSI clustering and even demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based framework called GridFormer which serves as a backbone for image restoration under adverse weather conditions. GridFormer is designed in a grid structure using a residual dense transformer block, and it introduces two core designs. First, it uses an enhanced attention mechanism in the transformer layer. The mechanism includes stages of the sampler and compact self-attention to improve efficiency, and a local enhancement stage to strengthen local information. Second, we introduce a residual dense transformer block (RDTB) as the final GridFormer layer. This design further improves the network's ability to learn effective features from both preceding and current local features. The GridFormer framework achieves state-of-the-art results on five diverse image restoration tasks in adverse weather conditions, including image deraining, dehazing, deraining \& dehazing, desnowing, and multi-weather restoration.

| **[Diffusion Model-based FOD Restoration from High Distortion in dMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13209v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fiber orientation distributions (FODs) is a popular model to represent the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. However, imaging artifacts such as susceptibility-induced distortion in dMRI can cause signal loss and lead to the corrupted reconstruction of FODs, which prohibits successful fiber tracking and connectivity analysis in affected brain regions such as the brain stem. Generative models, such as the diffusion models, have been successfully applied in various image restoration tasks. However, their application on FOD images poses unique challenges since FODs are 4-dimensional data represented by spherical harmonics (SPHARM) with the 4-th dimension exhibiting order-related dependency. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model for FOD restoration that can recover the signal loss caused by distortion artifacts. We use volume-order encoding to enhance the ability of the diffusion model to generate individual FOD volumes at all SPHARM orders. Moreover, we add cross-attention features extracted across all SPHARM orders in generating every individual FOD volume to capture the order-related dependency across FOD volumes. We also condition the diffusion model with low-distortion FODs surrounding high-distortion areas to maintain the geometric coherence of the generated FODs. We trained and tested our model using data from the UK Biobank (n = 1315). On a test set with ground truth (n = 43), we demonstrate the high accuracy of the generated FODs in terms of root mean square errors of FOD volumes and angular errors of FOD peaks. We also apply our method to a test set with large distortion in the brain stem area (n = 1172) and demonstrate the efficacy of our method in restoring the FOD integrity and, hence, greatly improving tractography performance in affected brain regions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Restorer: Solving Multiple Image Restoration Tasks with One Set of Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12587v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although there are many excellent solutions in image restoration, the fact that they are specifically designed for a single image restoration task may prevent them from being state-of-the-art (SOTA) in other types of image restoration tasks. While some approaches require considering multiple image restoration tasks, they are still not sufficient for the requirements of the real world and may suffer from the task confusion issue. In this work, we focus on designing a unified and effective solution for multiple image restoration tasks including deraining, desnowing, defogging, deblurring, denoising, and low-light enhancement. Based on the above purpose, we propose a Transformer network Restorer with U-Net architecture. In order to effectively deal with degraded information in multiple image restoration tasks, we need a more comprehensive attention mechanism. Thus, we design all-axis attention (AAA) through stereo embedding and 3D convolution, which can simultaneously model the long-range dependencies in both spatial and channel dimensions, capturing potential correlations among all axis. Moreover, we propose a Restorer based on textual prompts. Compared to previous methods that employ learnable queries, textual prompts bring explicit task priors to solve the task confusion issue arising from learnable queries and introduce interactivity. Based on these designs, Restorer demonstrates SOTA or comparable performance in multiple image restoration tasks compared to universal image restoration frameworks and methods specifically designed for these individual tasks. Meanwhile, Restorer is faster during inference. The above results along with the real-world test results show that Restorer has the potential to serve as a backbone for multiple real-world image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step Effective Diffusion Network for Real-World Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08177v2)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have been increasingly employed to tackle the real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) problem due to their powerful generative image priors. Most of the existing methods start from random noise to reconstruct the high-quality (HQ) image under the guidance of the given low-quality (LQ) image. While promising results have been achieved, such Real- ISR methods require multiple diffusion steps to reproduce the HQ image, increasing the computational cost. Meanwhile, the random noise introduces uncertainty in the output, which is unfriendly to image restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a one-step effective diffusion network, namely OSEDiff, for the Real- ISR problem. We argue that the LQ image contains rich information to restore its HQ counterpart, and hence the given LQ image can be directly taken as the starting point for diffusion, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by random noise sampling. We finetune the pre-trained diffusion network with trainable layers to adapt it to complex image degradations. To ensure that the one-step diffusion model could yield HQ Real-ISR output, we apply variational score distillation in the latent space to conduct KL-divergence regularization. As a result, our OSEDiff model can efficiently and effectively generate HQ images in just one diffusion step. Our experiments demonstrate that OSEDiff achieves comparable or even better Real-ISR results, in terms of both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, than previous diffusion model based Real-ISR methods that require dozens or hundreds of steps. The source codes will be released at https://github.com/cswry/OSEDiff.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA, which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First, a Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content, ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale, providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second, our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases, in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation, in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method, marking a significant improvement over prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024, Project Page: https://dsl-fiqa.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Blind Super-Resolution via Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08896v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based approaches have witnessed great successes in blind single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks, however, handcrafted kernel priors and learning based kernel priors are typically required. In this paper, we propose a Meta-learning and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based SISR approach to learn kernel priors from organized randomness. In concrete, a lightweight network is adopted as kernel generator, and is optimized via learning from the MCMC simulation on random Gaussian distributions. This procedure provides an approximation for the rational blur kernel, and introduces a network-level Langevin dynamics into SISR optimization processes, which contributes to preventing bad local optimal solutions for kernel estimation. Meanwhile, a meta-learning-based alternating optimization procedure is proposed to optimize the kernel generator and image restorer, respectively. In contrast to the conventional alternating minimization strategy, a meta-learning-based framework is applied to learn an adaptive optimization strategy, which is less-greedy and results in better convergence performance. These two procedures are iteratively processed in a plug-and-play fashion, for the first time, realizing a learning-based but plug-and-play blind SISR solution in unsupervised inference. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance and generalization ability of the proposed approach when comparing with state-of-the-arts on synthesis and real-world datasets.

Traditional methods often falter with variable document types, leading to poor performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a text-graphic layer separation approach that enhances domain adaptability in document image restoration (DIR) systems. We propose LayeredDoc, which utilizes two layers of information: the first targets coarse-grained graphic components, while the second refines machine-printed textual content. This hierarchical DIR framework dynamically adjusts to the characteristics of the input document, facilitating effective domain adaptation. We evaluated our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively using a new real-world dataset, LayeredDocDB, developed for this study. Initially trained on a synthetically generated dataset, our model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for the DIR task, offering a promising solution for handling variability in real-world data.

In this paper, we present Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method to quantify changes in image deep features under varying degradation conditions. Specifically, our approach facilitates flexible and adaptive degradation, enabling the controlled synthesis of image degradation through text-driven prompts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the versatility of DDR as an image descriptor, with strong correlations observed with key image attributes such as complexity, colorfulness, sharpness, and overall quality. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of DDR across a spectrum of applications. It excels as a blind image quality assessment metric, outperforming existing methodologies across multiple datasets. Additionally, DDR serves as an effective unsupervised learning objective in image restoration tasks, yielding notable advancements in image deblurring and single-image super-resolution.

Improvement in Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction has been achieved by integrating Swin Image Restoration (SwinIR) based sinogram and image enhancement modules. The proposed methodology uses Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent (NAG) to solve the least squares (NAG-LS) problem in CT image reconstruction. The integration of sinogram and image enhancement modules aims to enhance image clarity and preserve fine details, offering a promising solution for both low dose and clinical dose CBCT reconstruction. The averaged mean squared error (MSE) over the validation dataset has decreased significantly, in the case of low dose by one-fifth and clinical dose by one-tenth. Our solution is one of the top 5 approaches in this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemosaicFormer: Coarse-to-Fine Demosaicing Network for HybridEVS Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07951v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid Event-Based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) is a novel sensor integrating traditional frame-based and event-based sensors, offering substantial benefits for applications requiring low-light, high dynamic range, and low-latency environments, such as smartphones and wearable devices. Despite its potential, the lack of Image signal processing (ISP) pipeline specifically designed for HybridEVS poses a significant challenge. To address this challenge, in this study, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework named DemosaicFormer which comprises coarse demosaicing and pixel correction. Coarse demosaicing network is designed to produce a preliminary high-quality estimate of the RGB image from the HybridEVS raw data while the pixel correction network enhances the performance of image restoration and mitigates the impact of defective pixels. Our key innovation is the design of a Multi-Scale Gating Module (MSGM) applying the integration of cross-scale features, which allows feature information to flow between different scales. Additionally, the adoption of progressive training and data augmentation strategies further improves model's robustness and effectiveness. Experimental results show superior performance against the existing methods both qualitatively and visually, and our DemosaicFormer achieves the best performance in terms of all the evaluation metrics in the MIPI 2024 challenge on Demosaic for Hybridevs Camera.

Data aggregation as well as high-resolution image generation both usually come at the risk of involving aliases, i.e.~standard architectures put their ability to reconstruct the model input in jeopardy to reach high PSNR values on validation data. The price to be paid is low model robustness. In this work, we show that simply providing alias-free paths in state-of-the-art reconstruction transformers supports improved model robustness at low costs on the restoration performance. We do so by proposing BOA-Restormer, a transformer-based image restoration model that executes downsampling and upsampling operations partly in the frequency domain to ensure alias-free paths along the entire model while potentially preserving all relevant high-frequency information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tags:...</summary><p>Tags: Adversarial attack, image restoration, image deblurring, frequency sampling</p></details> |

Since inverse problems inherently entail maximum a posteriori estimation, previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the optimization frameworks. However, prevailing optimization-based inverse algorithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable. By employing gradient truncation, the projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

| **[The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09253v4)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms, addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic model to imitate stochastic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding Image Priors through Sparse Generators at Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05288v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Optimal Eye Surgeon (OES), a framework for pruning and training deep image generator networks. Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors (Ulyanov et al., 2018). However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy images, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks (Wu et al., 2023). Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.

We show that our approach competes with large state-of-the-art models in specific cases. We also show that training a model on a single image is particularly relevant for image acquisition modality that differ from the RGB images of standard learning databases. We show results in three different contexts: texture images, line drawing images, and materials BRDF, for which we achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of realism, with a computational load that is greatly reduced compared to concurrent methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image restoration, which consists of three components, \textit{i.e.}, i) a pre-trained and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better performance than those task-specific methods.

We first propose an extrapolated DYS method to effectively solve a class of structural nonconvex optimization problems that involve minimizing the sum of three possible nonconvex functions. Our approach provides an algorithmic framework that encompasses both extrapolated forward-backward splitting and extrapolated Douglas-Rachford splitting methods. To establish the convergence of the proposed method, we rigorously analyze its behavior based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, subject to some tight parameter conditions. Moreover, we introduce two extrapolated PnP-DYS methods with convergence guarantee, where the traditional regularization prior is replaced by a gradient step-based denoiser. This denoiser is designed using a differentiable neural network and can be reformulated as the proximal operator of a specific nonconvex functional. We conduct extensive experiments on image deblurring and image super-resolution problems, where our results showcase the advantage of the extrapolation strategy and the superior performance of the learning-based model that incorporates the PnP denoiser in terms of achieving high-quality recovery images.</p></details> | 37 Pages |

In this paper, we consider a general type of non-convex optimisation model that captures many inverse image problems and present an inertial block proximal linearised minimisation (iBPLM) algorithm. Our new method unifies the Jacobi-type parallel and the Gauss-Seidel-type alternating update rules, and extends beyond these approaches. The inertial technique is also incorporated into each block-wise subproblem update, which can accelerate numerical convergence. Furthermore, we extend this framework with a plug-and-play variant (PnP-iBPLM) that integrates deep gradient denoisers, offering a flexible and robust solution for complex imaging tasks. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating both subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithms. To validate our methods, we apply them to multi-block dictionary learning problems in image denoising and deblurring. Experimental results show that both iBPLM and PnP-iBPLM significantly enhance numerical performance and robustness in these applications.</p></details> | 6 figures, 6 tables |

However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Matching Transformation Transformers for UHD Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00629v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes UHDformer, a general Transformer for Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image restoration. UHDformer contains two learning spaces: (a) learning in high-resolution space and (b) learning in low-resolution space. The former learns multi-level high-resolution features and fuses low-high features and reconstructs the residual images, while the latter explores more representative features learning from the high-resolution ones to facilitate better restoration. To better improve feature representation in low-resolution space, we propose to build feature transformation from the high-resolution space to the low-resolution one. To that end, we propose two new modules: Dual-path Correlation Matching Transformation module (DualCMT) and Adaptive Channel Modulator (ACM). The DualCMT selects top C/r (r is greater or equal to 1 which controls the squeezing level) correlation channels from the max-pooling/mean-pooling high-resolution features to replace low-resolution ones in Transformers, which can effectively squeeze useless content to improve the feature representation in low-resolution space to facilitate better recovery. The ACM is exploited to adaptively modulate multi-level high-resolution features, enabling to provide more useful features to low-resolution space for better learning. Experimental results show that our UHDformer reduces about ninety-seven percent model sizes compared with most state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving performance under different training sets on 3 UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image enhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring.

Recent progress in image restoration has demonstrated the efficacy of learning large models capable of addressing various degradations simultaneously. Nonetheless, these approaches introduce considerable computational overhead and complex learning paradigms, limiting their practical utility. In response, we propose \textit{DaAIR}, an efficient All-in-One image restorer employing a Degradation-aware Learner (DaLe) in the low-rank regime to collaboratively mine shared aspects and subtle nuances across diverse degradations, generating a degradation-aware embedding. By dynamically allocating model capacity to input degradations, we realize an efficient restorer integrating holistic and specific learning within a unified model. Furthermore, DaAIR introduces a cost-efficient parameter update mechanism that enhances degradation awareness while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive comparisons across five image degradations demonstrate that our DaAIR outperforms both state-of-the-art All-in-One models and degradation-specific counterparts, affirming our efficacy and practicality.

| **[Restoration by Generation with Constrained Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17161v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent generative power of denoising diffusion models makes them well-suited for image restoration tasks where the objective is to find the optimal high-quality image within the generative space that closely resembles the input image. We propose a method to adapt a pretrained diffusion model for image restoration by simply adding noise to the input image to be restored and then denoise. Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strategy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space. This approach allows us to produce results that accurately preserve high-frequency details, which previous works are unable to do.

| **[Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766v4)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, and do not fully explore the potential of utilizing multiple images. Motivated by the fact that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/BracketIRE.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the Vision Transformers (ViTs) emergence has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19572v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various methods have been proposed to solve Image Restoration (IR) tasks using a pre-trained diffusion model leading to state-of-the-art performance. However, most of these methods assume that the degradation operator in the IR task is completely known. Furthermore, a common characteristic among these approaches is that they alter the diffusion sampling process in order to satisfy the consistency with the degraded input image. This choice has recently been shown to be sub-optimal and to cause the restored image to deviate from the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/hamadichihaoui/BIRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serpent: Scalable and Efficient Image Restoration via Multi-scale Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17902v2)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of computational building blocks of efficient image restoration architectures is dominated by a combination of convolutional processing and various attention mechanisms. However, convolutional filters, while efficient, are inherently local and therefore struggle with modeling long-range dependencies in images. In contrast, attention excels at capturing global interactions between arbitrary image regions, but suffers from a quadratic cost in image dimension. In this work, we propose Serpent, an efficient architecture for high-resolution image restoration that combines recent advances in state space models (SSMs) with multi-scale signal processing in its core computational block. SSMs, originally introduced for sequence modeling, can maintain a global receptive field with a favorable linear scaling in input size. We propose a novel hierarchical architecture inspired by traditional signal processing principles, that converts the input image into a collection of sequences and processes them in a multi-scale fashion. Our experimental results demonstrate that Serpent can achieve reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art techniques, while requiring orders of magnitude less compute (up to $150$ fold reduction in FLOPS) and a factor of up to $5\times$ less GPU memory while maintaining a compact model size. The efficiency gains achieved by Serpent are especially notable at high image resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054v5)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</p></details> |  |

AutoDIR excels in its ability to automatically identify and restore images suffering from a range of unknown degradations. AutoDIR offers intuitive open-vocabulary image editing, empowering users to customize and enhance images according to their preferences. Specifically, AutoDIR consists of two key stages: a Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) stage based on a semantic-agnostic vision-language model which automatically detects unknown image degradations for input images, an All-in-One Image Restoration (AIR) stage utilizes structural-corrected latent diffusion which handles multiple types of image degradations. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that AutoDIR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for a wider range of image restoration tasks. The design of AutoDIR also enables flexible user control (via text prompt) and generalization to new tasks as a foundation model of image restoration.

| **[Fast Samplers for Inverse Problems in Iterative Refinement Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17673v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing fast samplers for unconditional diffusion and flow-matching models has received much attention recently; however, existing methods for solving inverse problems, such as super-resolution, inpainting, or deblurring, still require hundreds to thousands of iterative steps to obtain high-quality results. We propose a plug-and-play framework for constructing efficient samplers for inverse problems, requiring only pre-trained diffusion or flow-matching models. We present Conditional Conjugate Integrators, which leverage the specific form of the inverse problem to project the respective conditional diffusion/flow dynamics into a more amenable space for sampling. Our method complements popular posterior approximation methods for solving inverse problems using diffusion/flow models. We evaluate the proposed method's performance on various linear image restoration tasks across multiple datasets, employing diffusion and flow-matching models. Notably, on challenging inverse problems like 4$\times$ super-resolution on the ImageNet dataset, our method can generate high-quality samples in as few as 5 conditional sampling steps and outperforms competing baselines requiring 20-1000 steps. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/mandt-lab/CI2RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Uncertainty Exploration via Feedforward Posterior Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15719v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using tree-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.</p></details> | 32 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Blaze3DM: Marry Triplane Representation with Diffusion for 3D Medical Inverse Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15241v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving 3D medical inverse problems such as image restoration and reconstruction is crucial in modern medical field. However, the curse of dimensionality in 3D medical data leads mainstream volume-wise methods to suffer from high resource consumption and challenges models to successfully capture the natural distribution, resulting in inevitable volume inconsistency and artifacts. Some recent works attempt to simplify generation in the latent space but lack the capability to efficiently model intricate image details. To address these limitations, we present Blaze3DM, a novel approach that enables fast and high-fidelity generation by integrating compact triplane neural field and powerful diffusion model. In technique, Blaze3DM begins by optimizing data-dependent triplane embeddings and a shared decoder simultaneously, reconstructing each triplane back to the corresponding 3D volume. To further enhance 3D consistency, we introduce a lightweight 3D aware module to model the correlation of three vertical planes. Then, diffusion model is trained on latent triplane embeddings and achieves both unconditional and conditional triplane generation, which is finally decoded to arbitrary size volume. Extensive experiments on zero-shot 3D medical inverse problem solving, including sparse-view CT, limited-angle CT, compressed-sensing MRI, and MRI isotropic super-resolution, demonstrate that Blaze3DM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also markedly improves computational efficiency over existing methods (22~40x faster than previous work).</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14343v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13805v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) only if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered entirely incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the Group Perceptual Index (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect Perceptual Fairness (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image super-resolution algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Traditional enhancement techniques often fail to adequately address issues like noise, color distortion, and detail loss in challenging lighting environments. Our approach leverages insights from the Retinex theory and recent advances in image restoration networks to develop a streamlined model that efficiently processes illumination components and integrates context-sensitive enhancements through optimized convolutional blocks. This results in significantly improved image clarity and color fidelity, while avoiding over-enhancement and unnatural color shifts. Crucially, our model is designed to be lightweight, ensuring low computational demand and suitability for real-time applications on standard consumer hardware. Performance evaluations confirm that our model not only surpasses existing methods in enhancing low-light images but also maintains a minimal computational footprint.</p></details> |  |

The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[A New Cross-Space Total Variation Regularization Model for Color Image Restoration with Quaternion Blur Operator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12114v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The cross-channel deblurring problem in color image processing is difficult to solve due to the complex coupling and structural blurring of color pixels. Until now, there are few efficient algorithms that can reduce color infection in deblurring process. To solve this challenging problem, we present a novel cross-space total variation (CSTV) regularization model for color image deblurring by introducing a quaternion blur operator and a cross-color space regularization functional. The existence and uniqueness of the solution is proved and a new L-curve method is proposed to find a sweet balance of regularization functionals on different color spaces. The Euler-Lagrange equation is derived to show that CSTV has taken into account the coupling of all color channels and the local smoothing within each color channel. A quaternion operator splitting method is firstly proposed to enhance the ability of color infection reduction of the CSTV regularization model. This strategy also applies to the well-known color deblurring models. Numerical experiments on color image databases illustrate the efficiency and manoeuvrability of the new model and algorithms. The color images restored by them successfully maintain the color and spatial information and are of higher quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MSE and CIEde2000 than the restorations of the-state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15pages,10figures |
| **[Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emphasizing Crucial Features for Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11468v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a challenging ill-posed problem which estimates latent sharp image from its degraded counterpart. Although the existing methods have achieved promising performance by designing novelty architecture of module, they ignore the fact that different regions in a corrupted image undergo varying degrees of degradation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective framework to adapt to varying degrees of degradation across different regions for image restoration. Specifically, we design a spatial and frequency attention mechanism (SFAM) to emphasize crucial features for restoration. SFAM consists of two modules: the spatial domain attention module (SDAM) and the frequency domain attention module (FDAM). The SFAM discerns the degradation location through spatial selective attention and channel selective attention in the spatial domain, while the FDAM enhances high-frequency signals to amplify the disparities between sharp and degraded image pairs in the spectral domain. Additionally, to capture global range information, we introduce a multi-scale block (MSBlock) that consists of three scale branches, each containing multiple simplified channel attention blocks (SCABlocks) and a multi-scale feed-forward block (MSFBlock). Finally, we propose our ECFNet, which integrates the aforementioned components into a U-shaped backbone for recovering high-quality images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFNet, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, in image restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution through the Doob's h-transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models, all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution.

Building on this success, we introduce an instruction-based object addition pipeline, named Add-SD, which automatically inserts objects into realistic scenes with rational sizes and positions. Different from layout-conditioned methods, Add-SD is solely conditioned on simple text prompts rather than any other human-costly references like bounding boxes. Our work contributes in three aspects: proposing a dataset containing numerous instructed image pairs; fine-tuning a diffusion model for rational generation; and generating synthetic data to boost downstream tasks. The first aspect involves creating a RemovalDataset consisting of original-edited image pairs with textual instructions, where an object has been removed from the original image while maintaining strong pixel consistency in the background. These data pairs are then used for fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion (SD) model. Subsequently, the pretrained Add-SD model allows for the insertion of expected objects into an image with good rationale. Additionally, we generate synthetic instances for downstream task datasets at scale, particularly for tail classes, to alleviate the long-tailed problem. Downstream tasks benefit from the enriched dataset with enhanced diversity and rationale. Experiments on LVIS val demonstrate that Add-SD yields an improvement of 4.3 mAP on rare classes over the baseline.

| **[On the Exploitation of DCT-Traces in the Generative-AI Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02209v3)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfakes represent one of the toughest challenges in the world of Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, especially considering the high-quality results obtained with recent generative AI-based solutions. Almost all generative models leave unique traces in synthetic data that, if analyzed and identified in detail, can be exploited to improve the generalization limitations of existing deepfake detectors. In this paper we analyzed deepfake images in the frequency domain generated by both GAN and Diffusion Model engines, examining in detail the underlying statistical distribution of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Recognizing that not all coefficients contribute equally to image detection, we hypothesize the existence of a unique ``discriminative fingerprint", embedded in specific combinations of coefficients. To identify them, Machine Learning classifiers were trained on various combinations of coefficients. In addition, the Explainable AI (XAI) LIME algorithm was used to search for intrinsic discriminative combinations of coefficients. Finally, we performed a robustness test to analyze the persistence of traces by applying JPEG compression. The experimental results reveal the existence of traces left by the generative models that are more discriminative and persistent at JPEG attacks. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/opontorno/dcts_analysis_deepfakes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Image Detection: The Challenge of Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20836v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of these AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. For the task of AIGI detection, we propose a new attack containing two main parts. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous models, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as frequency-based post-train Bayesian attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light and Optimal Schrödinger Bridge Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03207v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schr\"odinger Bridges (SB) have recently gained the attention of the ML community as a promising extension of classic diffusion models which is also interconnected to the Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT). Recent solvers for SB exploit the pervasive bridge matching procedures. Such procedures aim to recover a stochastic process transporting the mass between distributions given only a transport plan between them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these procedures can be adapted to solve SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent works giving rise to matching-based SB solvers. The cornerstone here is recovering the EOT plan: recent works either use heuristical approximations (e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching procedures which by the design accumulate the error during the training. We address these limitations and propose a novel procedure to learn SB which we call the \textbf{optimal Schr\"odinger bridge matching}. It exploits the optimal parameterization of the diffusion process and provably recovers the SB process \textbf{(a)} with a single bridge matching step and \textbf{(b)} with arbitrary transport plan as the input. Furthermore, we show that the optimal bridge matching objective coincides with the recently discovered energy-based modeling (EBM) objectives to learn EOT/SB. Inspired by this observation, we develop a light solver (which we call LightSB-M) to implement optimal matching in practice using the Gaussian mixture parameterization of the adjusted Schr\"odinger potential. We experimentally showcase the performance of our solver in a range of practical tasks. The code for our solver can be found at https://github.com/SKholkin/LightSB-Matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Augmented Agents: A Framework for Efficient Exploration and Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20798v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks.

| **[Forecasting Tropical Cyclones with Cascaded Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01690v7)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As tropical cyclones become more intense due to climate change, the rise of Al-based modelling provides a more affordable and accessible approach compared to traditional methods based on mathematical models. This work leverages generative diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric data. It employs a cascaded approach that incorporates three main tasks: forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling. The training dataset includes 51 cyclones from six major tropical cyclone basins from January 2019 - March 2023. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with excellent Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak-Singal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. The 36-hour forecasts can be produced in as little as 30 mins on a single Nvidia A30/RTX 2080 Ti. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of Al methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs in weather forecasting, such as tropical cyclone forecasting, while remaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p></details> |  |

Yet, it presents many challenges, often related to the lack of flexibility and generalizability of state-of-the-art solutions. Diffusion models are a cutting-edge neural architecture transforming 2D and 3D computer vision, outlining remarkable performances in zero-shot novel-view synthesis. Such a use case is particularly intriguing for reconstructing 3D objects. However, localizing objects in unstructured environments is rather unexplored. To this end, this work presents Zero123-6D, the first work to demonstrate the utility of Diffusion Model-based novel-view-synthesizers in enhancing RGB 6D pose estimation at category-level, by integrating them with feature extraction techniques. Novel View Synthesis allows to obtain a coarse pose that is refined through an online optimization method introduced in this work to deal with intra-category geometric differences. In such a way, the outlined method shows reduction in data requirements, removal of the necessity of depth information in zero-shot category-level 6D pose estimation task, and increased performance, quantitatively demonstrated through experiments on the CO3D dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 reference pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Controllable Face Synthesis with Semantic Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12743v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) is among the most popular and effective techniques in the field of face generation and editing, thanks to its good generation quality and the versatility is brings along. Recent works attempted to go beyond the standard GAN-based framework, and started to explore Diffusion Models (DMs) for this task as these stand out with respect to GANs in terms of both quality and diversity. On the other hand, DMs lack in fine-grained controllability and reproducibility. To address that, in this paper we propose a SIS framework based on a novel Latent Diffusion Model architecture for human face generation and editing that is both able to reproduce and manipulate a real reference image and generate diversity-driven results. The proposed system utilizes both SPADE normalization and cross-attention layers to merge shape and style information and, by doing so, allows for a precise control over each of the semantic parts of the human face. This was not possible with previous methods in the state of the art. Finally, we performed an extensive set of experiments to prove that our model surpasses current state of the art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoSonics: Generating Synchronized Audio for Silent Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20592v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EgoSonics, a method to generate semantically meaningful and synchronized audio tracks conditioned on silent egocentric videos. Generating audio for silent egocentric videos could open new applications in virtual reality, assistive technologies, or for augmenting existing datasets. Existing work has been limited to domains like speech, music, or impact sounds and cannot easily capture the broad range of audio frequencies found in egocentric videos. EgoSonics addresses these limitations by building on the strength of latent diffusion models for conditioned audio synthesis. We first encode and process audio and video data into a form that is suitable for generation. The encoded data is used to train our model to generate audio tracks that capture the semantics of the input video. Our proposed SyncroNet builds on top of ControlNet to provide control signals that enables temporal synchronization to the synthesized audio. Extensive evaluations show that our model outperforms existing work in audio quality, and in our newly proposed synchronization evaluation method. Furthermore, we demonstrate downstream applications of our model in improving video summarization.</p></details> | preprint |

Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to existing text-to-3D approaches.

However, existing methods often struggle to generate accurate and consistent counterfactuals, particularly when the causal relationships are complex. We propose a novel framework that incorporates causal mechanisms and diffusion models to generate high-quality counterfactual samples guided by causal representation. Our approach introduces a novel, theoretically grounded training and sampling process that enables the model to consistently generate accurate counterfactual high-dimensional data under multiple intervention steps. Experimental results on various synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating accurate and high-quality counterfactuals, using different evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap: Studio-like Avatar Creation from a Monocular Phone Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19593v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating photorealistic avatars for individuals traditionally involves extensive capture sessions with complex and expensive studio devices like the LightStage system. While recent strides in neural representations have enabled the generation of photorealistic and animatable 3D avatars from quick phone scans, they have the capture-time lighting baked-in, lack facial details and have missing regions in areas such as the back of the ears. Thus, they lag in quality compared to studio-captured avatars. In this paper, we propose a method that bridges this gap by generating studio-like illuminated texture maps from short, monocular phone captures. We do this by parameterizing the phone texture maps using the $W^+$ space of a StyleGAN2, enabling near-perfect reconstruction. Then, we finetune a StyleGAN2 by sampling in the $W^+$ parameterized space using a very small set of studio-captured textures as an adversarial training signal. To further enhance the realism and accuracy of facial details, we super-resolve the output of the StyleGAN2 using carefully designed diffusion model that is guided by image gradients of the phone-captured texture map. Once trained, our method excels at producing studio-like facial texture maps from casual monocular smartphone videos. Demonstrating its capabilities, we showcase the generation of photorealistic, uniformly lit, complete avatars from monocular phone captures.

In this paper, we propose a training-based method leveraging auto-generated paired data to learn desired editing while ensuring the preservation of unchanged subject features. Specifically, we design a data generation process to create reasonably good training pairs for desired editing at low cost. Based on these pairs, we introduce a Multi-Conditioned Diffusion Model to effectively learn the editing direction and preserve subject features. During inference, our model produces accurate editing mask that can guide the inference process to further preserve detailed subject features. Experiments on costume editing and cartoon expression editing show that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality, quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel motion-aware video generation (MoVideo) framework that takes motion into consideration from two aspects: video depth and optical flow. The former regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video decoding from the latent space to the pixel space. In experiments, MoVideo achieves state-of-the-art results in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation, showing promising prompt consistency, frame consistency and visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024.

| **[Contrasting Deepfakes Diffusion via Contrastive Learning and Global-Local Similarities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20337v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discerning between authentic content and that generated by advanced AI methods has become increasingly challenging. While previous research primarily addresses the detection of fake faces, the identification of generated natural images has only recently surfaced. This prompted the recent exploration of solutions that employ foundation vision-and-language models, like CLIP. However, the CLIP embedding space is optimized for global image-to-text alignment and is not inherently designed for deepfake detection, neglecting the potential benefits of tailored training and local image features. In this study, we propose CoDE (Contrastive Deepfake Embeddings), a novel embedding space specifically designed for deepfake detection. CoDE is trained via contrastive learning by additionally enforcing global-local similarities. To sustain the training of our model, we generate a comprehensive dataset that focuses on images generated by diffusion models and encompasses a collection of 9.2 million images produced by using four different generators. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the newly collected dataset, while also showing excellent generalization capabilities to unseen image generators. Our source code, trained models, and collected dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/CoDE.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Sun Off, Lights On: Photorealistic Monocular Nighttime Simulation for Robust Semantic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20336v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime scenes are hard to semantically perceive with learned models and annotate for humans. Thus, realistic synthetic nighttime data become all the more important for learning robust semantic perception at night, thanks to their accurate and cheap semantic annotations. However, existing data-driven or hand-crafted techniques for generating nighttime images from daytime counterparts suffer from poor realism. The reason is the complex interaction of highly spatially varying nighttime illumination, which differs drastically from its daytime counterpart, with objects of spatially varying materials in the scene, happening in 3D and being very hard to capture with such 2D approaches. The above 3D interaction and illumination shift have proven equally hard to model in the literature, as opposed to other conditions such as fog or rain. Our method, named Sun Off, Lights On (SOLO), is the first to perform nighttime simulation on single images in a photorealistic fashion by operating in 3D. It first explicitly estimates the 3D geometry, the materials and the locations of light sources of the scene from the input daytime image and relights the scene by probabilistically instantiating light sources in a way that accounts for their semantics and then running standard ray tracing. Not only is the visual quality and photorealism of our nighttime images superior to competing approaches including diffusion models, but the former images are also proven more beneficial for semantic nighttime segmentation in day-to-night adaptation. Code and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> | Submitted for review |

To solve this problem, we propose $\textit{Specify ANd Edit}$ (SANE), a zero-shot inference pipeline for diffusion-based editing systems. We use a large language model (LLM) to decompose the input instruction into specific instructions, i.e. well-defined interventions to apply to the input image to satisfy the user's request. We benefit from the LLM-derived instructions along the original one, thanks to a novel denoising guidance strategy specifically designed for the task. Our experiments with three baselines and on two datasets demonstrate the benefits of SANE in all setups. Moreover, our pipeline improves the interpretability of editing models, and boosts the output diversity. We also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to any edit, whether ambiguous or not. Our code is public at https://github.com/fabvio/SANE.</p></details> |  |
| **[LatentArtiFusion: An Effective and Efficient Histological Artifacts Restoration Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20172v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histological artifacts pose challenges for both pathologists and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, leading to errors in analysis. Current approaches for histological artifact restoration, based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and pixel-level Diffusion Models, suffer from performance limitations and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, LatentArtiFusion, which leverages the latent diffusion model (LDM) to reconstruct histological artifacts with high performance and computational efficiency. Unlike traditional pixel-level diffusion frameworks, LatentArtiFusion executes the restoration process in a lower-dimensional latent space, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a novel regional artifact reconstruction algorithm in latent space to prevent mistransfer in non-artifact regions, distinguishing our approach from GAN-based methods. Through extensive experiments on real-world histology datasets, LatentArtiFusion demonstrates remarkable speed, outperforming state-of-the-art pixel-level diffusion frameworks by more than 30X. It also consistently surpasses GAN-based methods by at least 5% across multiple evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in downstream tissue classification tasks, showcasing its practical utility.

| **[Diffusion Feedback Helps CLIP See Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20171v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which excels at abstracting open-world representations across domains and modalities, has become a foundation for a variety of vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent studies reveal that CLIP has severe visual shortcomings, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. These visual shortcomings also limit the perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) built on CLIP. The main reason could be that the image-text pairs used to train CLIP are inherently biased, due to the lack of the distinctiveness of the text and the diversity of images. In this work, we present a simple post-training approach for CLIP models, which largely overcomes its visual shortcomings via a self-supervised diffusion process. We introduce DIVA, which uses the DIffusion model as a Visual Assistant for CLIP. Specifically, DIVA leverages generative feedback from text-to-image diffusion models to optimize CLIP representations, with only images (without corresponding text). We demonstrate that DIVA improves CLIP's performance on the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark which assesses fine-grained visual abilities to a large extent (e.g., 3-7%), and enhances the performance of MLLMs and vision models on multimodal understanding and segmentation tasks. Extensive evaluation on 29 image classification and retrieval benchmarks confirms that our framework preserves CLIP's strong zero-shot capabilities.

| **[DDAP: Dual-Domain Anti-Personalization against Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20141v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based personalized visual content generation technologies have achieved significant breakthroughs, allowing for the creation of specific objects by just learning from a few reference photos. However, when misused to fabricate fake news or unsettling content targeting individuals, these technologies could cause considerable societal harm. To address this problem, current methods generate adversarial samples by adversarially maximizing the training loss, thereby disrupting the output of any personalized generation model trained with these samples. However, the existing methods fail to achieve effective defense and maintain stealthiness, as they overlook the intrinsic properties of diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce a novel Dual-Domain Anti-Personalization framework (DDAP). Specifically, we have developed Spatial Perturbation Learning (SPL) by exploiting the fixed and perturbation-sensitive nature of the image encoder in personalized generation. Subsequently, we have designed a Frequency Perturbation Learning (FPL) method that utilizes the characteristics of diffusion models in the frequency domain. The SPL disrupts the overall texture of the generated images, while the FPL focuses on image details. By alternating between these two methods, we construct the DDAP framework, effectively harnessing the strengths of both domains. To further enhance the visual quality of the adversarial samples, we design a localization module to accurately capture attentive areas while ensuring the effectiveness of the attack and avoiding unnecessary disturbances in the background. Extensive experiments on facial benchmarks have shown that the proposed DDAP enhances the disruption of personalized generation models while also maintaining high quality in adversarial samples, making it more effective in protecting privacy in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05953v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) tries to formulate VFI as a diffusion-based conditional image generation problem, synthesizing the intermediate frame given a random noise and neighboring frames. Due to the relatively high resolution of videos, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are employed as the conditional generation model, where the autoencoder compresses images into latent representations for diffusion and then reconstructs images from these latent representations. Such a formulation poses a crucial challenge: VFI expects that the output is deterministically equal to the ground truth intermediate frame, but LDMs randomly generate a diverse set of different images when the model runs multiple times. The reason for the diverse generation is that the cumulative variance (variance accumulated at each step of generation) of generated latent representations in LDMs is large. This makes the sampling trajectory random, resulting in diverse rather than deterministic generations. To address this problem, we propose our unique solution: Frame Interpolation with Consecutive Brownian Bridge Diffusion. Specifically, we propose consecutive Brownian Bridge diffusion that takes a deterministic initial value as input, resulting in a much smaller cumulative variance of generated latent representations. Our experiments suggest that our method can improve together with the improvement of the autoencoder and achieve state-of-the-art performance in VFI, leaving strong potential for further enhancement.</p></details> | corrected typo |
| **[Diffusion-DICE: In-Sample Diffusion Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20109v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One important property of DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods is that the solution is the optimal stationary distribution ratio between the optimized and data collection policy. In this work, we show that DICE-based methods can be viewed as a transformation from the behavior distribution to the optimal policy distribution. Based on this, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-DICE, that directly performs this transformation using diffusion models. We find that the optimal policy's score function can be decomposed into two terms: the behavior policy's score function and the gradient of a guidance term which depends on the optimal distribution ratio. The first term can be obtained from a diffusion model trained on the dataset and we propose an in-sample learning objective to learn the second term. Due to the multi-modality contained in the optimal policy distribution, the transformation in Diffusion-DICE may guide towards those local-optimal modes. We thus generate a few candidate actions and carefully select from them to approach global-optimum. Different from all other diffusion-based offline RL methods, the guide-then-select paradigm in Diffusion-DICE only uses in-sample actions for training and brings minimal error exploitation in the value function. We use a didatic toycase example to show how previous diffusion-based methods fail to generate optimal actions due to leveraging these errors and how Diffusion-DICE successfully avoids that. We then conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to show the strong performance of Diffusion-DICE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

We propose a novel pipeline to tackle this challenge, by generating geospecifc views that maximally respect the weak geometry and texture from multi-view satellite images. Different from existing approaches that hallucinate images from cues such as partial semantics or geometry from overhead satellite images, our method directly predicts ground-view images at geolocation by using a comprehensive set of information from the satellite image, resulting in ground-level images with a resolution boost at a factor of ten or more. We leverage a novel building refinement method to reduce geometric distortions in satellite data at ground level, which ensures the creation of accurate conditions for view synthesis using diffusion networks. Moreover, we proposed a novel geospecific prior, which prompts distribution learning of diffusion models to respect image samples that are closer to the geolocation of the predicted images. We demonstrate our pipeline is the first to generate close-to-real and geospecific ground views merely based on satellite images.</p></details> | 11 figures |

They exhibit great potential for helping reduce ill-posedness and attain high-quality results. However, the latent tensors of such deep generative models can fall out of the desired high-dimensional standard Gaussian distribution during inversion, particularly in the presence of data noise and inaccurate forward models, leading to low-fidelity solutions. To address this issue, we propose to reparameterize and Gaussianize the latent tensors using novel differentiable data-dependent layers wherein custom operators are defined by solving optimization problems. These proposed layers constrain inverse problems to obtain high-fidelity in-distribution solutions. We validate our technique on three inversion tasks: compressive-sensing MRI, image deblurring, and eikonal tomography (a nonlinear PDE-constrained inverse problem) using two representative deep generative models: StyleGAN2 and Glow. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency.</p></details> | ICLR 2023 |

While this capability is beneficial for many industries, the difficulty of identifying synthetic images leaves online media platforms vulnerable to impersonation and misinformation attempts. To support the development of defensive methods, we introduce ImagiNet, a high-resolution and balanced dataset for synthetic image detection, designed to mitigate potential biases in existing resources. It contains 200K examples, spanning four content categories: photos, paintings, faces, and uncategorized. Synthetic images are produced with open-source and proprietary generators, whereas real counterparts of the same content type are collected from public datasets. The structure of ImagiNet allows for a two-track evaluation system: i) classification as real or synthetic and ii) identification of the generative model. To establish a baseline, we train a ResNet-50 model using a self-supervised contrastive objective (SelfCon) for each track. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and high inference speed across established benchmarks, achieving an AUC of up to 0.99 and balanced accuracy ranging from 86% to 95%, even under social network conditions that involve compression and resizing.

While diffusion models have shown impressive capabilities, current approaches often overlook a wide range of modalities and their interactions, resulting in less dynamic and contextually varied gestures. To address these challenges, we present MambaGesture, a novel framework integrating a Mamba-based attention block, MambaAttn, with a multi-modality feature fusion module, SEAD. The MambaAttn block combines the sequential data processing strengths of the Mamba model with the contextual richness of attention mechanisms, enhancing the temporal coherence of generated gestures. SEAD adeptly fuses audio, text, style, and emotion modalities, employing disentanglement to deepen the fusion process and yield gestures with greater realism and diversity. Our approach, rigorously evaluated on the multi-modal BEAT dataset, demonstrates significant improvements in Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), diversity scores, and beat alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance in co-speech gesture generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2024</p></details> |

With the development of the diffusion model (DM), several methods employ the DM for OSFL, utilizing model parameters, image features, or textual prompts as mediums to transfer the local client knowledge to the server. However, these mediums often require public datasets or the uniform feature extractor, significantly limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose FedDEO, a Description-Enhanced One-Shot Federated Learning Method with DMs, offering a novel exploration of utilizing the DM in OSFL. The core idea of our method involves training local descriptions on the clients, serving as the medium to transfer the knowledge of the distributed clients to the server. Firstly, we train local descriptions on the client data to capture the characteristics of client distributions, which are then uploaded to the server. On the server, the descriptions are used as conditions to guide the DM in generating synthetic datasets that comply with the distributions of various clients, enabling the training of the aggregated model. Theoretical analyses and sufficient quantitation and visualization experiments on three large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that through the training of local descriptions, the server is capable of generating synthetic datasets with high quality and diversity. Consequently, with advantages in communication and privacy protection, the aggregated model outperforms compared FL or diffusion-based OSFL methods and, on some clients, outperforms the performance ceiling of centralized training.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 24 |

However, training models for long video generation tasks require significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long video diffusion models. This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g. pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g. 128 frames). Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless transitions between scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yulu.net.cn/freelong</p></details> |

This approach eliminates the need for specifying initial states or performing lengthy simulations, significantly accelerating the process. While adept at sampling individual frames from the learned manifold of turbulent flow states, the previous model lacks the capability to generate sequences, hindering analysis of dynamic phenomena. This work addresses this limitation by introducing a 4D generative diffusion model and a physics-informed guidance technique that enables the generation of realistic sequences of flow states. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can successfully sample entire subsequences from the turbulent manifold, even though generalizing from individual frames to sequences remains a challenging task. This advancement opens doors for the application of generative modeling in analyzing the temporal evolution of turbulent flows, providing valuable insights into their complex dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI4Sc...</summary><p>AI4Science Workshop @ ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, there is no established framework for quantifying the reliability of AI-generated images, which hinders their use in critical decision-making tasks, such as medical image diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method to quantify the reliability of decision-making tasks that rely on images produced by diffusion models within a statistical testing framework. The core concept of our statistical test involves using a selective inference framework, in which the statistical test is conducted under the condition that the images are produced by a trained diffusion model. As a case study, we study a diffusion model-based anomaly detection task for medical images. With our approach, the statistical significance of medical image diagnostic outcomes can be quantified in terms of a p-value, enabling decision-making with a controlled error rate. We demonstrate the theoretical soundness and practical effectiveness of our statistical test through numerical experiments on both synthetic and brain image datasets.</p></details> | 31 pages, 7 figures |

Despite the success of some conditional methods, previous methods may neglect the importance of a sufficient formulation of task-specific condition strategy, resulting in suboptimal visual outcomes. In this study, we propose JoReS-Diff, a novel approach that incorporates Retinex- and semantic-based priors as the additional pre-processing condition to regulate the generating capabilities of the diffusion model. We first leverage pre-trained decomposition network to generate the Retinex prior, which is updated with better quality by an adjustment network and integrated into a refinement network to implement Retinex-based conditional generation at both feature- and image-levels. Moreover, the semantic prior is extracted from the input image with an off-the-shelf semantic segmentation model and incorporated through semantic attention layers. By treating Retinex- and semantic-based priors as the condition, JoReS-Diff presents a unique perspective for establishing an diffusion model for LLIE and similar image enhancement tasks. Extensive experiments validate the rationality and superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Improving Diffusion Models for Authentic Virtual Try-on in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05139v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers image-based virtual try-on, which renders an image of a person wearing a curated garment, given a pair of images depicting the person and the garment, respectively. Previous works adapt existing exemplar-based inpainting diffusion models for virtual try-on to improve the naturalness of the generated visuals compared to other methods (e.g., GAN-based), but they fail to preserve the identity of the garments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model that improves garment fidelity and generates authentic virtual try-on images. Our method, coined IDM-VTON, uses two different modules to encode the semantics of garment image; given the base UNet of the diffusion model, 1) the high-level semantics extracted from a visual encoder are fused to the cross-attention layer, and then 2) the low-level features extracted from parallel UNet are fused to the self-attention layer. In addition, we provide detailed textual prompts for both garment and person images to enhance the authenticity of the generated visuals. Finally, we present a customization method using a pair of person-garment images, which significantly improves fidelity and authenticity. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches (both diffusion-based and GAN-based) in preserving garment details and generating authentic virtual try-on images, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the proposed customization method demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a method that leverages pretrained text-to-image models as a prior, and learn to generate multi-view images in a single denoising process from real-world data. Concretely, we propose to integrate 3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into each block of the existing U-Net network of the text-to-image model. Moreover, we design an autoregressive generation that renders more 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint. We train our model on real-world datasets of objects and showcase its capabilities to generate instances with a variety of high-quality shapes and textures in authentic surroundings.

While SDS exhibits the capability to create impressive 3D assets, it is hindered by its inherent maximum-likelihood-seeking essence, resulting in limited diversity in generation outcomes. In this paper, we discover that the Denoise Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) generation process (\ie PF-ODE) can be succinctly expressed using an analogue of SDS loss. One step further, one can see SDS as a generalized DDIM generation process. Following this insight, we show that the noise sampling strategy in the noise addition stage significantly restricts the diversity of generation results. To address this limitation, we present an innovative noise sampling approach and introduce a novel text-to-3D method called Flow Score Distillation (FSD). Our validation experiments across various text-to-image Diffusion Models demonstrate that FSD substantially enhances generation diversity without compromising quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Consi...</summary><p>Consistent Flow Distillation is an improved version of this paper</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a unified 3D generation framework called Cycle3D, which cyclically utilizes a 2D diffusion-based generation module and a feed-forward 3D reconstruction module during the multi-step diffusion process. Concretely, 2D diffusion model is applied for generating high-quality texture, and the reconstruction model guarantees multi-view consistency.Moreover, 2D diffusion model can further control the generated content and inject reference-view information for unseen views, thereby enhancing the diversity and texture consistency of 3D generation during the denoising process.

| **[Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19547v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues in traditional models. Unlike those models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step $t$ for effective multi-round denoising. Typically, $t$ from the finite set $\{1, \ldots, T\}$ is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules, entirely independent of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework: 1)~TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block~(TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction~(TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration~(FSC) are developed to efficiently align full precision temporal features. 2)~Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3)~Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection for superior maintenance. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets and diffusion models confirms our superior results. Notably, our approach closely matches the performance of the full-precision model under 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, the quantized SD-XL model achieves hardware acceleration of 2.20$\times$ on CPU and 5.76$\times$ on GPU demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |

However, most diffusion models are limited to visible RGB image generation. In fact, human perception of the world is enriched by diverse viewpoints, including chromatic contrast, thermal illumination, and depth information. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion model for general layout-guided cross-modal ``RGB+X'' generation, called DiffX. Firstly, we construct the cross-modal image datasets with text description by using LLaVA for image captioning, supplemented by manual corrections. Notably, DiffX presents a simple yet effective cross-modal generative modeling pipeline, which conducts diffusion and denoising processes in the modality-shared latent space, facilitated by our Dual Path Variational AutoEncoder (DP-VAE). Moreover, we introduce the joint-modality embedder, which incorporates a gated cross-attention mechanism to link layout and text conditions. Meanwhile, the advanced Long-CLIP is employed for long caption embedding to improve user guidance. Through extensive experiments, DiffX demonstrates robustness and flexibility in cross-modal generation across three RGB+X datasets: FLIR, MFNet, and COME15K, guided by various layout types. It also shows the potential for adaptive generation of ``RGB+X+Y'' or more diverse modalities.

Unlike prior methods that neglect layout consistency, lack the ability to handle detailed text prompts, or are incapable of generalizing to unseen view points, MVPbev simultaneously generates cross-view consistent images of different perspective views with a two-stage design, allowing object-level control and novel view generation at test-time. Specifically, MVPbev firstly projects given BEV semantics to perspective view with camera parameters, empowering the model to generalize to unseen view points. Then we introduce a multi-view attention module where special initialization and de-noising processes are introduced to explicitly enforce local consistency among overlapping views w.r.t. cross-view homography. Last but not least, MVPbev further allows test-time instance-level controllability by refining a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our extensive experiments on NuScenes demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-resolution photorealistic images from text descriptions with thousands of training samples, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods under various evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate the advances of our method in terms of generalizability and controllability with the help of novel evaluation metrics and comprehensive human analysis.

However, parcellation does not always reach 100% accuracy due to various factors, including inter-individual anatomical variability and the quality of neuroimaging scan data. The failure to identify parcels causes a problem of missing microstructure data values, which is especially challenging for downstream tasks that analyze large brain datasets. In this work, we propose a novel deep-learning model to impute tissue microstructure: the White Matter Geometry-guided Diffusion (WMG-Diff) model. Specifically, we first propose a deep score-based guided diffusion model to impute tissue microstructure for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography fiber clusters. Second, we propose a white matter atlas geometric relationship-guided denoising function to guide the reverse denoising process at the subject-specific level.

However, existing models tend to produce visual objects commonly found in the training dataset, which diverges from user input prompts. The underlying reason behind the inaccurate generated results lies in the model's difficulty in sampling from specific intervals of the initial noise distribution corresponding to the prompt. Moreover, it is challenging to directly optimize the initial distribution, given that the diffusion process involves multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we introduce a Fine-tuning Initial Noise Distribution (FIND) framework with policy optimization, which unleashes the powerful potential of pre-trained diffusion networks by directly optimizing the initial distribution to align the generated contents with user-input prompts. To this end, we first reformulate the diffusion denoising procedure as a one-step Markov decision process and employ policy optimization to directly optimize the initial distribution. In addition, a dynamic reward calibration module is proposed to ensure training stability during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a ratio clipping algorithm to utilize historical data for network training and prevent the optimized distribution from deviating too far from the original policy to restrain excessive optimization magnitudes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both text-to-image and text-to-video tasks, surpassing SOTA methods in achieving consistency between prompts and the generated content. Our method achieves 10 times faster than the SOTA approach. Our homepage is available at \url{https://github.com/vpx-ecnu/FIND-website}.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by altering the generative process to deviate away from the ground-truth denoising procedure. To manage the computational complexity inherent in the diffusion process, we develop a first-order method for solving the optimization problem, which has shown empirical benefits.

Despite promising identity fidelity has been achieved by several tuning-free methods, they usually suffer from overfitting issues. The learned identity tends to entangle with irrelevant information, resulting in unsatisfied text controllability, especially on faces. In this work, we present MasterWeaver, a test-time tuning-free method designed to generate personalized images with both faithful identity fidelity and flexible editability. Specifically, MasterWeaver adopts an encoder to extract identity features and steers the image generation through additional introduced cross attention. To improve editability while maintaining identity fidelity, we propose an editing direction loss for training, which aligns the editing directions of our MasterWeaver with those of the original T2I model. Additionally, a face-augmented dataset is constructed to facilitate disentangled identity learning, and further improve the editability.

While prior research has established quantifiable links between model output and training data in diverse settings, interpreting diffusion model outputs in relation to training samples remains underexplored. In particular, diffusion models operate over a sequence of timesteps instead of instantaneous input-output relationships in previous contexts, posing a significant challenge to extend existing frameworks to diffusion models directly. Notably, we present Diffusion-TracIn that incorporates this temporal dynamics and observe that samples' loss gradient norms are highly dependent on timestep. This trend leads to a prominent bias in influence estimation, and is particularly noticeable for samples trained on large-norm-inducing timesteps, causing them to be generally influential. To mitigate this effect, we introduce Diffusion-ReTrac as a re-normalized adaptation that enables the retrieval of training samples more targeted to the test sample of interest, facilitating a localized measurement of influence and considerably more intuitive visualization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through various evaluation metrics and auxiliary tasks, reducing the amount of generally influential samples to $\frac{1}{3}$ of its original quantity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR.

While traditional approaches for hand generation have primarily focused on visibility and diversity under scene constraints, they tend to overlook the fine-grained hand-object interactions such as contacts, resulting in inaccurate and undesired grasps. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable grasp generation task and introduce ClickDiff, a controllable conditional generation model that leverages a fine-grained Semantic Contact Map (SCM). Particularly when synthesizing interactive grasps, the method enables the precise control of grasp synthesis through either user-specified or algorithmically predicted Semantic Contact Map. Specifically, to optimally utilize contact supervision constraints and to accurately model the complex physical structure of hands, we propose a Dual Generation Framework. Within this framework, the Semantic Conditional Module generates reasonable contact maps based on fine-grained contact information, while the Contact Conditional Module utilizes contact maps alongside object point clouds to generate realistic grasps. We evaluate the evaluation criteria applicable to controllable grasp generation. Both unimanual and bimanual generation experiments on GRAB and ARCTIC datasets verify the validity of our proposed method, demonstrating the efficacy and robustness of ClickDiff, even with previously unseen objects.

Our method employs adversarial training to distill knowledge from existing large-scale image generation models, minimizing the reliance on annotated data and enhancing the diversity in generation. This distillation approach aligns the distribution of the generated materials with that of image textures from an SDXL model, enabling the generation of novel materials that are not present in the initial training dataset. Furthermore, we employ a diffusion-based refiner model to improve the visual quality of the samples and achieve high-resolution generation. Finally, we distill a latent consistency model for fast generation in just four steps and propose a new tileability technique that removes visual artifacts typically associated with fewer diffusion steps. We detail the architecture and training process of StableMaterials, the integration of semi-supervised training within existing LDM frameworks and show the advantages of our approach.

We propose to formulate this ill-posed problem as a controlled synthesis one, leveraging the recent progress in generative deep networks. We present ControlMat, a method which, given a single photograph with uncontrolled illumination as input, conditions a diffusion model to generate plausible, tileable, high-resolution physically-based digital materials. We carefully analyze the behavior of diffusion models for multi-channel outputs, adapt the sampling process to fuse multi-scale information and introduce rolled diffusion to enable both tileability and patched diffusion for high-resolution outputs. Our generative approach further permits exploration of a variety of materials which could correspond to the input image, mitigating the unknown lighting conditions. We show that our approach outperforms recent inference and latent-space-optimization methods, and carefully validate our diffusion process design choices.

| **[Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Are randomly sampled Gaussian noises equally good for diffusion models? While a large body of works tried to understand and improve diffusion models, previous works overlooked the possibility to select or optimize the sampled noise the possibility of selecting or optimizing sampled noises for improving diffusion models. In this paper, we mainly made three contributions. First, we report that not all noises are created equally for diffusion models. We are the first to hypothesize and empirically observe that the generation quality of diffusion models significantly depend on the noise inversion stability. This naturally provides us a noise selection method according to the inversion stability. Second, we further propose a novel noise optimization method that actively enhances the inversion stability of arbitrary given noises. Our method is the first one that works on noise space to generally improve generated results without fine-tuning diffusion models. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed noise selection and noise optimization methods both significantly improve representative diffusion models, such as SDXL and SDXL-turbo, in terms of human preference and other objective evaluation metrics. For example, the human preference winning rates of noise selection and noise optimization over the baselines can be up to 57% and 72.5%, respectively, on DrawBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Radio Frequency Signal based Human Silhouette Segmentation: A Sequential Diffusion Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19244v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio frequency (RF) signals have been proved to be flexible for human silhouette segmentation (HSS) under complex environments. Existing studies are mainly based on a one-shot approach, which lacks a coherent projection ability from the RF domain. Additionally, the spatio-temporal patterns have not been fully explored for human motion dynamics in HSS. Therefore, we propose a two-stage Sequential Diffusion Model (SDM) to progressively synthesize high-quality segmentation jointly with the considerations on motion dynamics. Cross-view transformation blocks are devised to guide the diffusion model in a multi-scale manner for comprehensively characterizing human related patterns in an individual frame such as directional projection from signal planes. Moreover, spatio-temporal blocks are devised to fine-tune the frame-level model to incorporate spatio-temporal contexts and motion dynamics, enhancing the consistency of the segmentation maps. Comprehensive experiments on a public benchmark -- HIBER demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method with an IoU 0.732.

We first collect a dataset using visual teleoperation, where the human operator can directly play within a physical simulator to manipulate the articulated objects. We record the data and obtain free and accurate annotations on object poses and contact information from the simulator. Our system only requires an iPhone to record human hand motion, which can be easily scaled up and largely lower the costs of data and annotation collection. With this data, we learn 3D interaction priors including a discriminator (in a GAN) capturing the distribution of how object parts are arranged, and a diffusion model which generates the contact regions on articulated objects, guiding the hand pose estimation. Such structural and contact priors can easily transfer to real-world data with barely any domain gap. By using our data and learned priors, our method significantly improves the performance on joint hand and articulated object poses estimation over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

IHC stains are crucial in pathology practice for resolving complex diagnostic questions and guiding patient treatment decisions. While commercial laboratories offer a wide array of up to 400 different antibody-based IHC stains, small biopsies often lack sufficient tissue for multiple stains while preserving material for subsequent molecular testing. This highlights the need for virtual IHC staining. Notably, VIMs is the first model to address this need, leveraging a large vision-language single-step diffusion model for virtual IHC multiplexing through text prompts for each IHC marker. VIMs is trained on uniplex paired H&E and IHC images, employing an adversarial training module. Testing of VIMs includes both paired and unpaired image sets. To enhance computational efficiency, VIMs utilizes a pre-trained large latent diffusion model fine-tuned with small, trainable weights through the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) approach. Experiments on nuclear and cytoplasmic IHC markers demonstrate that VIMs outperforms the base diffusion model and achieves performance comparable to Pix2Pix, a standard generative model for paired image translation. Multiple evaluation methods, including assessments by two pathologists, are used to determine the performance of VIMs. Additionally, experiments with different prompts highlight the impact of text conditioning. This paper represents the first attempt to accelerate histopathology research by demonstrating the generation of multiple IHC stains from a single H&E input using a single model trained solely on uniplex data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI Workshop 2024</p></details> |
| **[ScalingGaussian: Enhancing 3D Content Creation with Generative Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19035v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of high-quality 3D assets is paramount for applications in digital heritage preservation, entertainment, and robotics. Traditionally, this process necessitates skilled professionals and specialized software for the modeling, texturing, and rendering of 3D objects. However, the rising demand for 3D assets in gaming and virtual reality (VR) has led to the creation of accessible image-to-3D technologies, allowing non-professionals to produce 3D content and decreasing dependence on expert input. Existing methods for 3D content generation struggle to simultaneously achieve detailed textures and strong geometric consistency. We introduce a novel 3D content creation framework, ScalingGaussian, which combines 3D and 2D diffusion models to achieve detailed textures and geometric consistency in generated 3D assets. Initially, a 3D diffusion model generates point clouds, which are then densified through a process of selecting local regions, introducing Gaussian noise, followed by using local density-weighted selection. To refine the 3D gaussians, we utilize a 2D diffusion model with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, guiding the 3D Gaussians to clone and split. Finally, the 3D Gaussians are converted into meshes, and the surface textures are optimized using Mean Square Error(MSE) and Gradient Profile Prior(GPP) losses. Our method addresses the common issue of sparse point clouds in 3D diffusion, resulting in improved geometric structure and detailed textures. Experiments on image-to-3D tasks demonstrate that our approach efficiently generates high-quality 3D assets.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Unifying Visual and Semantic Feature Spaces with Diffusion Models for Enhanced Cross-Modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18854v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image classification models often demonstrate unstable performance in real-world applications due to variations in image information, driven by differing visual perspectives of subject objects and lighting discrepancies. To mitigate these challenges, existing studies commonly incorporate additional modal information matching the visual data to regularize the model's learning process, enabling the extraction of high-quality visual features from complex image regions. Specifically, in the realm of multimodal learning, cross-modal alignment is recognized as an effective strategy, harmonizing different modal information by learning a domain-consistent latent feature space for visual and semantic features. However, this approach may face limitations due to the heterogeneity between multimodal information, such as differences in feature distribution and structure. To address this issue, we introduce a Multimodal Alignment and Reconstruction Network (MARNet), designed to enhance the model's resistance to visual noise. Importantly, MARNet includes a cross-modal diffusion reconstruction module for smoothly and stably blending information across different domains. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, Vireo-Food172 and Ingredient-101, demonstrate that MARNet effectively improves the quality of image information extracted by the model. It is a plug-and-play framework that can be rapidly integrated into various image classification frameworks, boosting model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewpoint Textual Inversion: Discovering Scene Representations and 3D View Control in 2D Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07986v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models generate impressive and realistic images, but do they learn to represent the 3D world from only 2D supervision? We demonstrate that yes, certain 3D scene representations are encoded in the text embedding space of models like Stable Diffusion. Our approach, Viewpoint Neural Textual Inversion (ViewNeTI), is to discover 3D view tokens; these tokens control the 3D viewpoint - the rendering pose in a scene - of generated images. Specifically, we train a small neural mapper to take continuous camera viewpoint parameters and predict a view token (a word embedding). This token conditions diffusion generation via cross-attention to produce images with the desired camera viewpoint. Using ViewNeTI as an evaluation tool, we report two findings: first, the text latent space has a continuous view-control manifold for particular 3D scenes; second, we find evidence for a generalized view-control manifold for all scenes. We conclude that since the view token controls the 3D `rendering' viewpoint, there is likely a scene representation embedded in frozen 2D diffusion models. Finally, we exploit the 3D scene representations for 3D vision tasks, namely, view-controlled text-to-image generation, and novel view synthesis from a single image, where our approach sets state-of-the-art for LPIPS.

However, sampling speed has traditionally not been a priority due to their popularity for image generation, limiting their application to dynamical tasks. While recent work has improved the sampling speed of diffusion-based robotic policies, they are restricted to techniques from the image generation domain. We adapt Temporally Entangled Diffusion (TEDi), a framework specific for trajectory generation, to speed up diffusion-based policies for imitation learning. We introduce TEDi Policy, with novel regimes for training and sampling, and show that it drastically improves the sampling speed while remaining performant when applied to state-of-the-art diffusion-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> |  |

In the recent paradigm of adopting off-the-shelf models, however, access to their training data is often infeasible or not practical, while most of such models are not originally trained concerning adversarial robustness. In this paper, we develop a scalable and model-agnostic solution to achieve adversarial robustness without using any data. Our intuition is to view recent text-to-image diffusion models as "adaptable" denoisers that can be optimized to specify target tasks. Based on this, we propose: (a) to initiate a denoise-and-classify pipeline that offers provable guarantees against adversarial attacks, and (b) to leverage a few synthetic reference images generated from the text-to-image model that enables novel adaptation schemes. Our experiments show that our data-free scheme applied to the pre-trained CLIP could improve the (provable) adversarial robustness of its diverse zero-shot classification derivatives (while maintaining their accuracy), significantly surpassing prior approaches that utilize the full training data. Not only for CLIP, we also demonstrate that our framework is easily applicable for robustifying other visual classifiers efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ChoiDae1/robustify-T2I</p></details> |

However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, accepted in the DGM4MICCAI workshop, MICCAI, 2024</p></details> |

Combining with semantic communications, diffusion models are used for tasks such as denoising, data reconstruction, and content generation. However, existing diffusion-based generative models do not consider the stringent bandwidth limitation, which limits its application in wireless communication. This paper introduces a diffusion-driven semantic communication framework with advanced VAE-based compression for bandwidth-constrained generative model. Our designed architecture utilizes the diffusion model, where the signal transmission process through the wireless channel acts as the forward process in diffusion. To reduce bandwidth requirements, we incorporate a downsampling module and a paired upsampling module based on a variational auto-encoder with reparameterization at the receiver to ensure that the recovered features conform to the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we derive the loss function for our proposed system and evaluate its performance through comprehensive experiments. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in pixel-level metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and semantic metrics like learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS). These enhancements are more profound regarding the compression rates and SNR compared to deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite the convenience, malicious users have misused these techniques to create fake images, thereby triggering a privacy security crisis. In light of this, proactive adversarial attacks are proposed to protect users against customization. The adversarial examples are trained to distort the customization model's outputs and thus block the misuse. In this paper, we propose DisDiff (Disrupting Diffusion), a novel adversarial attack method to disrupt the diffusion model outputs. We first delve into the intrinsic image-text relationships, well-known as cross-attention, and empirically find that the subject-identifier token plays an important role in guiding image generation. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Erasure module to explicitly "erase" the indicated attention maps and disrupt the text guidance. Besides,we analyze the influence of the sampling process of the diffusion model on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack and introduce a novel Merit Sampling Scheduler to adaptively modulate the perturbation updating amplitude in a step-aware manner. Our DisDiff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 12.75% of FDFR scores and 7.25% of ISM scores across two facial benchmarks and two commonly used prompts on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM2024</p></details> |

However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</p></details> |  |

Deepfake videos, which can convincingly impersonate individuals, have particularly garnered attention due to their potential misuse in spreading misinformation and creating fraudulent content. This survey paper examines the dual landscape of deepfake video generation and detection, emphasizing the need for effective countermeasures against potential abuses. We provide a comprehensive overview of current deepfake generation techniques, including face swapping, reenactment, and audio-driven animation, which leverage cutting-edge technologies like GANs and diffusion models to produce highly realistic fake videos. Additionally, we analyze various detection approaches designed to differentiate authentic from altered videos, from detecting visual artifacts to deploying advanced algorithms that pinpoint inconsistencies across video and audio signals. The effectiveness of these detection methods heavily relies on the diversity and quality of datasets used for training and evaluation. We discuss the evolution of deepfake datasets, highlighting the importance of robust, diverse, and frequently updated collections to enhance the detection accuracy and generalizability. As deepfakes become increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, developing advanced detection techniques that can keep pace with generation technologies is crucial. We advocate for a proactive approach in the "tug-of-war" between deepfake creators and detectors, emphasizing the need for continuous research collaboration, standardization of evaluation metrics, and the creation of comprehensive benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, given a single portrait as appearance reference, we aim to animate it with motion derived from a driving video, capturing both highly dynamic and subtle facial expressions along with wide-range head movements. As its core, we leverage the generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model as the rendering backbone, while achieve fine-grained head pose and expression control with novel controlling signals within the framework of ControlNet. In contrast to conventional coarse explicit controls such as facial landmarks, our motion control module is learned to interpret the dynamics directly from the original driving RGB inputs. The motion accuracy is further enhanced with a patch-based local control module that effectively enhance the motion attention to small-scale nuances like eyeball positions. Notably, to mitigate the identity leakage from the driving signals, we train our motion control modules with scaling-augmented cross-identity images, ensuring maximized disentanglement from the appearance reference modules. Experimental results demonstrate the universal effectiveness of X-Portrait across a diverse range of facial portraits and expressive driving sequences, and showcase its proficiency in generating captivating portrait animations with consistently maintained identity characteristics.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2024 |

Despite the remarkable success have been achieved by current image inpainting approaches, their application to the SOE task generally results in failure cases such as Object Missing, Text-Image Mismatch, and Distortion. These failures stem from the limited use of small-sized objects in training datasets and the downsampling operations employed by U-Net models, which hinders accurate generation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel training-based approach, SOEDiff, aimed at enhancing the capability of baseline models like StableDiffusion in editing small-sized objects while minimizing training costs. Specifically, our method involves two key components: SO-LoRA, which efficiently fine-tunes low-rank matrices, and Cross-Scale Score Distillation loss, which leverages high-resolution predictions from the pre-trained teacher diffusion model. Our method presents significant improvements on the test dataset collected from MSCOCO and OpenImage, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method in small object editing. In particular, when comparing SOEDiff with SD-I model on the OpenImage-f dataset, we observe a 0.99 improvement in CLIP-Score and a reduction of 2.87 in FID.</p></details> |  |

However, point-drag-based approaches suffer from computational overhead and misinterpretation of user intentions due to the sparsity of point-based editing instructions. In this paper, we propose a region-based copy-and-paste dragging method, RegionDrag, to overcome these limitations. RegionDrag allows users to express their editing instructions in the form of handle and target regions, enabling more precise control and alleviating ambiguity. In addition, region-based operations complete editing in one iteration and are much faster than point-drag-based methods. We also incorporate the attention-swapping technique for enhanced stability during editing. To validate our approach, we extend existing point-drag-based datasets with region-based dragging instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that RegionDrag outperforms existing point-drag-based approaches in terms of speed, accuracy, and alignment with user intentions. Remarkably, RegionDrag completes the edit on an image with a resolution of 512x512 in less than 2 seconds, which is more than 100x faster than DragDiffusion, while achieving better performance.

This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments are welcome.

However, the application of these technologies in the medical domain is often hindered by data scarcity, both in terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a new self-supervised pre-training protocol based on diffusion models for landmark detection in x-ray images. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised framework can provide accurate landmark detection with a minimal number of available annotated training images (up to 50), outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-trainings for three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.</p></details> |  |

They have recently shown to outperform both deterministic and alternative action distribution learning formulations. 3D robot policies use 3D scene feature representations aggregated from a single or multiple camera views using sensed depth. They have shown to generalize better than their 2D counterparts across camera viewpoints. We unify these two lines of work and present 3D Diffuser Actor, a neural policy equipped with a novel 3D denoising transformer that fuses information from the 3D visual scene, a language instruction and proprioception to predict the noise in noised 3D robot pose trajectories. 3D Diffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute performance gain of 18.1% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an absolute gain of 13.1% on a single-view setup. On the CALVIN benchmark, it improves over the current SOTA by a 9% relative increase. It also learns to control a robot manipulator in the real world from a handful of demonstrations. Through thorough comparisons with the current SOTA policies and ablations of our model, we show 3D Diffuser Actor's design choices dramatically outperform 2D representations, regression and classification objectives, absolute attentions, and holistic non-tokenized 3D scene embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This may not only lead to uncertainty in the reconstructed image but also in downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation. This uncertainty, however, is mostly not analyzed in the literature, even though probabilistic reconstruction models are commonly used. These models can be prone to ignore plausible but unlikely solutions like rare pathologies. Building on MRI reconstruction approaches based on diffusion models, we add guidance to the diffusion process during inference, generating two meaningfully diverse reconstructions corresponding to an upper and lower bound segmentation. The reconstruction uncertainty can then be quantified by the difference between these bounds, which we coin the 'uncertainty boundary'. We analyzed the behavior of the upper and lower bound segmentations for a wide range of acceleration factors and found the uncertainty boundary to be both more reliable and more accurate compared to repeated sampling.

Diffusion models, recognized as the cutting-edge technique for data generation, demonstrate significant potential in tabular data imputation tasks. However, in pursuit of diversity, vanilla diffusion models often exhibit sensitivity to initialized noises, which hinders the models from generating stable and accurate imputation results. Additionally, the sparsity inherent in tabular data poses challenges for diffusion models in accurately modeling the data manifold, impacting the robustness of these models for data imputation. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced diffusion model named Self-supervised imputation Diffusion Model (SimpDM for brevity), specifically tailored for tabular data imputation tasks. To mitigate sensitivity to noise, we introduce a self-supervised alignment mechanism that aims to regularize the model, ensuring consistent and stable imputation predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a carefully devised state-dependent data augmentation strategy within SimpDM, enhancing the robustness of the diffusion model when dealing with limited data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimpDM matches or outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

This model successfully extends the powerful capabilities of 2D segmentation models to 3D meshes, delivering accurate 3D segmentation across diverse meshes and segment descriptions. Specifically, our model leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) model to segment the target regions from images rendered from the 3D shape. In light of the importance of the texture for segmentation, we also leverage the pretrained stable diffusion model to generate images with textures from 3D shape, and leverage SAM to segment the target regions from images with textures. Textures supplement the shape for segmentation and facilitate accurate 3D segmentation even in geometrically non-prominent areas, such as segmenting a car door within a car mesh. To achieve the 3D segments, we render 2D images from different views and conduct segmentation for both textured and untextured images. Lastly, we develop a multi-view revoting scheme that integrates 2D segmentation results and confidence scores from various views onto the 3D mesh, ensuring the 3D consistency of segmentation results and eliminating inaccuracies from specific perspectives. Through these innovations, MeshSegmenter offers stable and reliable 3D segmentation results both quantitatively and qualitatively, highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in the field of 3D zero-shot segmentation.

In this work, we present a new approach for language-driven grasp detection that leverages the concept of lightweight diffusion models to achieve fast inference time. By integrating diffusion processes with grasping prompts in natural language, our method can effectively encode visual and textual information, enabling more accurate and versatile grasp positioning that aligns well with the text query. To overcome the long inference time problem in diffusion models, we leverage the image and text features as the condition in the consistency model to reduce the number of denoising timesteps during inference. The intensive experimental results show that our method outperforms other recent grasp detection methods and lightweight diffusion models by a clear margin.

While previous works have focused on ensuring grasp stability, they often do not consider human intention conveyed through natural language, hindering effective collaboration between robots and users in complex 3D environments. In this paper, we present a new approach for language-driven 6-DoF grasp detection in cluttered point clouds. We first introduce Grasp-Anything-6D, a large-scale dataset for the language-driven 6-DoF grasp detection task with 1M point cloud scenes and more than 200M language-associated 3D grasp poses. We further introduce a novel diffusion model that incorporates a new negative prompt guidance learning strategy. The proposed negative prompt strategy directs the detection process toward the desired object while steering away from unwanted ones given the language input. Our method enables an end-to-end framework where humans can command the robot to grasp desired objects in a cluttered scene using natural language. Intensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in both benchmarking experiments and real-world scenarios, surpassing other baselines. In addition, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in real-world robotic applications.

Despite significant advancements in such generative models, challenges persist in depicting detailed human-object interactions, especially regarding pose and object placement accuracy. We introduce a training-free method named Reasoning and Correcting Diffusion (ReCorD) to address these challenges. Our model couples Latent Diffusion Models with Visual Language Models to refine the generation process, ensuring precise depictions of HOIs. We propose an interaction-aware reasoning module to improve the interpretation of the interaction, along with an interaction correcting module to refine the output image for more precise HOI generation delicately. Through a meticulous process of pose selection and object positioning, ReCorD achieves superior fidelity in generated images while efficiently reducing computational requirements. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks to demonstrate the significant progress in solving text-to-image generation tasks, showcasing ReCorD's ability to render complex interactions accurately by outperforming existing methods in HOI classification score, as well as FID and Verb CLIP-Score.

From a pre-trained diffusion model, our approach trains a conditional flow model to minimize the divergence between the proposal variational distribution and the posterior distribution implicitly defined through the diffusion model. Once trained, the flow model is capable of sampling from the posterior distribution with a single NFE, amortized with respect to the measurement. The proposed method paves a new path for distilling a diffusion prior for efficient posterior sampling. We show that our method is applicable to standard signals in Euclidean space, as well as signals on manifold.</p></details> |  |

Traditional landscape painting methods involve using ink or colored ink on rice paper, which requires substantial time and effort. These methods are susceptible to errors and inconsistencies and lack precise control over lines and colors. This paper presents LPGen, a high-fidelity, controllable model for landscape painting generation, introducing a novel multi-modal framework that integrates image prompts into the diffusion model. We extract its edges and contours by computing canny edges from the target landscape image. These, along with natural language text prompts and drawing style references, are fed into the latent diffusion model as conditions. We implement a decoupled cross-attention strategy to ensure compatibility between image and text prompts, facilitating multi-modal image generation. A decoder generates the final image. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in landscape painting generation and exceeds the current state-of-the-art. The LPGen network effectively controls the composition and color of landscape paintings, generates more accurate images, and supports further research in deep learning-based landscape painting generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we delve deep into the noise initialization of video diffusion models, and discover an implicit training-inference gap that attributes to the unsatisfactory inference quality.Our key findings are: 1) the spatial-temporal frequency distribution of the initial noise at inference is intrinsically different from that for training, and 2) the denoising process is significantly influenced by the low-frequency components of the initial noise. Motivated by these observations, we propose a concise yet effective inference sampling strategy, FreeInit, which significantly improves temporal consistency of videos generated by diffusion models. Through iteratively refining the spatial-temporal low-frequency components of the initial latent during inference, FreeInit is able to compensate the initialization gap between training and inference, thus effectively improving the subject appearance and temporal consistency of generation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeInit consistently enhances the generation quality of various text-to-video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tianxingwu.github.io/pages/FreeInit/ Code: https://github.com/TianxingWu/FreeInit</p></details> |

With the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication capabilities of 6G, 6G-IoT networks can transmit high-quality and diverse data to enhance edge learning. Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) harnesses advanced AI algorithms to automatically generate various types of content. The emergence of edge AIGC integrates with edge networks, facilitating real-time provision of customized AIGC services by deploying AIGC models on edge devices. However, the current practice of edge devices as AIGC Service Providers (ASPs) lacks incentives, hindering the sustainable provision of high-quality edge AIGC services amidst information asymmetry. In this paper, we develop a user-centric incentive mechanism framework for edge AIGC services in 6G-IoT networks. Specifically, we first propose a contract theory model for incentivizing ASPs to provide AIGC services to clients. Recognizing the irrationality of clients towards personalized AIGC services, we utilize Prospect Theory (PT) to capture their subjective utility better. Furthermore, we adopt the diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm to generate the optimal contract design under PT, outperforming traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

We present a text-to-3D 360$^{\circ}$ scene generation pipeline that facilitates the creation of comprehensive 360$^{\circ}$ scenes for in-the-wild environments in a matter of minutes. Our approach utilizes the generative power of a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality and globally coherent panoramic image. This image acts as a preliminary "flat" (2D) scene representation. Subsequently, it is lifted into 3D Gaussians, employing splatting techniques to enable real-time exploration. To produce consistent 3D geometry, our pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud. This point cloud serves as the initial state for the centroids of 3D Gaussians. In order to address invisible issues inherent in single-view inputs, we impose semantic and geometric constraints on both synthesized and input camera views as regularizations. These guide the optimization of Gaussians, aiding in the reconstruction of unseen regions. In summary, our method offers a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360$^{\circ}$ perspective, providing an enhanced immersive experience over existing techniques.

However, the role of text embedding in the editing process has not been thoroughly investigated. A significant aspect that remains unexplored is the interaction between text and image embeddings. In this study, we show that during the progressive editing of an input image in a diffusion model, the text embedding remains constant. As the image embedding increasingly diverges from its initial state, the discrepancy between the image and text embeddings presents a significant challenge. Moreover, we found that the text prompt significantly influences the dragging process, particularly in maintaining content integrity and achieving the desired manipulation. To utilize these insights, we propose DragText, which optimizes text embedding in conjunction with the dragging process to pair with the modified image embedding. Simultaneously, we regularize the text optimization process to preserve the integrity of the original text prompt. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing diffusion-based drag methods with only a few lines of code.</p></details> | 22 pages, 18 figures |

Its potential in healthcare is significant, but challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data, exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues. CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation. The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution differences across clients without compromising privacy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional data collection methods are often too slow in these scenarios, requiring innovative approaches for quick, reliable model generation from minimal data. Our study introduces a novel approach by constructing a comprehensive computer vision model to detect Mpox lesions using only synthetic data. Initially, these models generated a diverse set of synthetic images representing Mpox lesions on various body parts (face, back, chest, leg, neck, arm) across different skin tones as defined by the Fitzpatrick scale (fair, brown, dark skin). Subsequently, we trained and tested a vision model with this synthetic dataset to evaluate the diffusion models' efficacy in producing high-quality training data and its impact on the vision model's medical image recognition performance. The results were promising; the vision model achieved a 97% accuracy rate, with 96% precision and recall for Mpox cases, and similarly high metrics for normal and other skin disorder cases, demonstrating its ability to correctly identify true positives and minimize false positives. The model achieved an F1-Score of 96% for Mpox cases and 98% for normal and other skin disorders, reflecting a balanced precision-recall relationship, thus ensuring reliability and robustness in its predictions. Our proposed SynthVision methodology indicates the potential to develop accurate computer vision models with minimal data input for future medical emergencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Most diffusion models, however, are limited to a single-generation modeling. Can we generalize diffusion models with the ability of multi-modal generative training for more generalizable modeling? In this paper, we propose a principled way to define a diffusion model by constructing a unified multi-modal diffusion model in a common diffusion space. We define the forward diffusion process to be driven by an information aggregation from multiple types of task-data, e.g., images for a generation task and labels for a classification task. In the reverse process, we enforce information sharing by parameterizing a shared backbone denoising network with additional modality-specific decoder heads. Such a structure can simultaneously learn to generate different types of multi-modal data with a multi-task loss, which is derived from a new multi-modal variational lower bound that generalizes the standard diffusion model. We propose several multimodal generation settings to verify our framework, including image transition, masked-image training, joint image-label and joint image-representation generative modeling. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet indicate the effectiveness of our framework for various multi-modal generative modeling, which we believe is an important research direction worthy of more future explorations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniProcessor: A Text-induced Unified Low-level Image Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20928v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image processing, including image restoration, image enhancement, etc., involves generating a high-quality clean image from a degraded input. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made notable advancements in this area. However, previous methods fail to effectively leverage the rich knowledge in language models and often incorporate label semantics into visual features unidirectionally. To overcome these problems, we propose a Split-and-Synthesize Prompting with Gated Alignments (SSPA) framework to amplify the potential of VLMs. Specifically, we develop an in-context learning approach to associate the inherent knowledge from LLMs. Then we propose a novel Split-and-Synthesize Prompting (SSP) strategy to first model the generic knowledge and downstream label semantics individually and then aggregate them carefully through the quaternion network. Moreover, we present Gated Dual-Modal Alignments (GDMA) to bidirectionally interact visual and linguistic modalities while eliminating redundant cross-modal information, enabling more efficient region-level alignments. Rather than making the final prediction by a sharp manner in previous works, we propose a soft aggregator to jointly consider results from all image regions. With the help of flexible prompting and gated alignments, SSPA is generalizable to specific domains. Extensive experiments on nine datasets from three domains (i.e., natural, pedestrian attributes and remote sensing) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SSPA. Further analyses verify the effectiveness of SSP and the interpretability of GDMA. The code will be made public.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving manipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents.

| **[OmniBal: Towards Fast Instruct-tuning for Vision-Language Models via Omniverse Computation Balance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20761v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language instruct-tuning models have made significant progress due to their more comprehensive understanding of the world. In this work, we discovered that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. We rebalanced the computational loads from data, model, and memory perspectives to address this issue, achieving more balanced computation across devices. These three components are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Specifically, for the data, we grouped instances into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. For the model, we employed a search-based method to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjusted the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, we significantly reduced GPU days, achieving about 1.8x speed-up. Our method's efficacy and generalizability were further demonstrated across various models and datasets. Codes will be released at https://github.com/ModelTC/OmniBal.</p></details> |  |

Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Zero-shot Generalization of Learned Prompts via Unsupervised Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03056v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/KDPL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ECCV24</p></details> |

While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2024</p></details> |

However, autonomous improvement requires solving two key problems: (i) fully automating a scalable data collection procedure that can collect diverse and semantically meaningful robot data and (ii) learning from non-optimal, autonomous data with no human annotations. To this end, we propose a novel approach that addresses these challenges, allowing instruction-following policies to improve from autonomously collected data without human supervision. Our framework leverages vision-language models to collect and evaluate semantically meaningful experiences in new environments, and then utilizes a decomposition of instruction following tasks into (semantic) language-conditioned image generation and (non-semantic) goal reaching, which makes it significantly more practical to improve from this autonomously collected data without any human annotations. We carry out extensive experiments in the real world to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and find that in a suite of unseen environments, the robot policy can be improved significantly with autonomously collected data. We open-source the code for our semantic autonomous improvement pipeline, as well as our autonomous dataset of 30.5K trajectories collected across five tabletop environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Prompt Learning through an External Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19674v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by the robot autonomously constructing a 3D representation of the scene, where objects can be rearranged virtually and an image of the resulting arrangement rendered. These renders are evaluated by a VLM, so that the arrangement which best satisfies the user instruction is selected and recreated in the real world with pick-and-place. This enables language-conditioned rearrangement to be performed zero-shot, without needing to collect a training dataset of example arrangements. Results on a series of real-world tasks show that this framework is robust to distractors, controllable by language, capable of understanding complex multi-object relations, and readily applicable to both tabletop and 6-DoF rearrangement tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2024.

To address this problem, we propose FlexAttention, a flexible attention mechanism for efficient high-resolution vision-language models. Specifically, a high-resolution image is encoded both as high-resolution tokens and low-resolution tokens, where only the low-resolution tokens and a few selected high-resolution tokens are utilized to calculate the attention map, which greatly shrinks the computational cost. The high-resolution tokens are selected via a high-resolution selection module which could retrieve tokens of relevant regions based on an input attention map. The selected high-resolution tokens are then concatenated to the low-resolution tokens and text tokens, and input to a hierarchical self-attention layer which produces an attention map that could be used for the next-step high-resolution token selection. The hierarchical self-attention process and high-resolution token selection process are performed iteratively for each attention layer. Experiments on multimodal benchmarks prove that our FlexAttention outperforms existing high-resolution VLMs (e.g., relatively ~9% in V* Bench, ~7% in TextVQA), while also significantly reducing the computational cost by nearly 40%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Normality Addition via Normality Detection in Industrial Image Anomaly Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19849v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of image anomaly detection (IAD) aims to identify deviations from normality in image data. These anomalies are patterns that deviate significantly from what the IAD model has learned from the data during training. However, in real-world scenarios, the criteria for what constitutes normality often change, necessitating the reclassification of previously anomalous instances as normal. To address this challenge, we propose a new scenario termed "normality addition," involving the post-training adjustment of decision boundaries to incorporate new normalities. To address this challenge, we propose a method called Normality Addition via Normality Detection (NAND), leveraging a vision-language model. NAND performs normality detection which detect patterns related to the intended normality within images based on textual descriptions. We then modify the results of a pre-trained IAD model to implement this normality addition. Using the benchmark dataset in IAD, MVTec AD, we establish an evaluation protocol for the normality addition task and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NAND method.</p></details> |  |

Agriculture is another key factor affecting the lives of people around the world. It provides food, fabric, and coal for humanity. However, facing many challenges such as pests and diseases, soil degradation, global warming, and food security, how to steadily increase the yield in the agricultural sector is a problem that humans still need to solve. Large models can help farmers improve production efficiency and harvest by detecting a series of agricultural production tasks such as pests and diseases, soil quality, and seed quality. It can also help farmers make wise decisions through a variety of information, such as images, text, etc. Herein, we delve into the potential applications of large models in agriculture, from large language model (LLM) and large vision model (LVM) to large vision-language models (LVLM). After gaining a deeper understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLM), it can be recognized that problems such as agricultural image processing, agricultural question answering systems, and agricultural machine automation can all be solved by large models. Large models have great potential in the field of agriculture. We outline the current applications of agricultural large models, and aims to emphasize the importance of large models in the domain of agriculture. In the end, we envisage a future in which famers use MLLM to accomplish many tasks in agriculture, which can greatly improve agricultural production efficiency and yield.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Fine-Tuning Impact Out-of-Distribution Detection for Vision-Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06048v3)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and generalization performance. However, their zero-shot in-distribution (ID) accuracy is often limited for downstream datasets. Recent CLIP-based fine-tuning methods such as prompt learning have demonstrated significant improvements in ID classification and OOD generalization where OOD labels are available. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the model is reliable to semantic shifts without OOD labels. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap and present a comprehensive study to understand how fine-tuning impact OOD detection for few-shot downstream tasks. By framing OOD detection as multi-modal concept matching, we establish a connection between fine-tuning methods and various OOD scores. Our results suggest that a proper choice of OOD scores is essential for CLIP-based fine-tuning. In particular, the maximum concept matching (MCM) score provides a promising solution consistently. We also show that prompt learning demonstrates the state-of-the-art OOD detection performance over the zero-shot counterpart.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCV 2023</p></details> |

We present a new evaluation benchmark focused on color, context, density, existence, quantity, and shape modifications. Our work not only sets the state-of-the-art for this task, but also serves as a foundational step in addressing a gap in the field of remote sensing image retrieval.

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |

While recent surgical AI models have focused on solving task-specific problems, there is a need for general-purpose systems that can understand surgical scenes and interact through natural language. This paper introduces GP-VLS, a general-purpose vision language model for surgery that integrates medical and surgical knowledge with visual scene understanding. For comprehensively evaluating general-purpose surgical models, we propose SurgiQual, which evaluates across medical and surgical knowledge benchmarks as well as surgical vision-language questions. To train GP-VLS, we develop six new datasets spanning medical knowledge, surgical textbooks, and vision-language pairs for tasks like phase recognition and tool identification. We show that GP-VLS significantly outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on surgical vision-language tasks, with 8-21% improvements in accuracy across SurgiQual benchmarks. GP-VLS also demonstrates strong performance on medical and surgical knowledge tests compared to open-source alternatives. Overall, GP-VLS provides an open-source foundation for developing AI assistants to support surgeons across a wide range of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's in a Name? Beyond Class Indices for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02364v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing machine learning models demonstrate excellent performance in image object recognition after training on a large-scale dataset under full supervision. However, these models only learn to map an image to a predefined class index, without revealing the actual semantic meaning of the object in the image. In contrast, vision-language models like CLIP are able to assign semantic class names to unseen objects in a 'zero-shot' manner, though they are once again provided a pre-defined set of candidate names at test-time. In this paper, we reconsider the recognition problem and task a vision-language model with assigning class names to images given only a large (essentially unconstrained) vocabulary of categories as prior information. We leverage non-parametric methods to establish meaningful relationships between images, allowing the model to automatically narrow down the pool of candidate names. Our proposed approach entails iteratively clustering the data and employing a voting mechanism to determine the most suitable class names. Additionally, we investigate the potential of incorporating additional textual features to enhance clustering performance. To achieve this, we employ the CLIP vision and text encoders to retrieve relevant texts from an external database, which can provide supplementary semantic information to inform the clustering process. Furthermore, we tackle this problem both in unsupervised and partially supervised settings, as well as with a coarse-grained and fine-grained search space as the unconstrained dictionary. Remarkably, our method leads to a roughly 50% improvement over the baseline on ImageNet in the unsupervised setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 Workshop on Computer Vision in the Wild</p></details> |

By zero-shot we mean that, for a novel environment, we feed a VLLM an image of the robot's environment and a description of the task, and have the VLLM output the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Prior work on VLLMs in robotics has largely focused on settings where some part of the pipeline is fine-tuned, such as tuning an LLM on robot data or training a separate vision encoder for perception and action generation. Surprisingly, due to recent advances in the capabilities of VLLMs, this type of fine-tuning may no longer be necessary for many tasks. In this work, we show that with careful engineering, we can prompt a single off-the-shelf VLLM to handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location-extraction and action-execution. Wonderful Team builds on recent advances in multi-agent LLMs to partition tasks across an agent hierarchy, making it self-corrective and able to effectively partition and solve even long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments on VIMABench and real-world robotic environments demonstrate the system's capability to handle a variety of robotic tasks, including manipulation, visual goal-reaching, and visual reasoning, all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year, and should strongly be considered as a backbone for robotics problems going forward.</p></details> | aka Wonderful Team |

Wolf is an automated captioning framework that adopts a mixture-of-experts approach, leveraging complementary strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs). By utilizing both image and video models, our framework captures different levels of information and summarizes them efficiently. Our approach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, and captioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-based metric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets in three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community (VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V). For instance, in comparison with GPT-4V, Wolf improves CapScore both quality-wise by 55.6% and similarity-wise by 77.4% on challenging driving videos. Finally, we establish a benchmark for video captioning and introduce a leaderboard, aiming to accelerate advancements in video understanding, captioning, and data alignment.

However, most existing methods overlook modality gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other, resulting in limited classification performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a method called Selective Vision-Language Subspace Projection (SSP), which incorporates local image features and utilizes them as a bridge to enhance the alignment between image-text pairs. Specifically, our SSP framework comprises two parallel modules: a vision projector and a language projector. Both projectors utilize local image features to span the respective subspaces for image and texts, thereby projecting the image and text features into their respective subspaces to achieve alignment. Moreover, our approach entails only training-free matrix calculations and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced CLIP-based few-shot learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets have demonstrated SSP's superior text-image alignment capabilities, outperforming the state-of-the-art alignment methods.

This complexity underlines the need for computer-aided diagnosis methods employing multi-label zero-shot learning. Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have showcased notable zero-shot classification abilities on medical images. However, these methods have limitations on leveraging extensive pre-trained knowledge from broader image datasets, and often depend on manual prompt construction by expert radiologists. By automating the process of prompt tuning, prompt learning techniques have emerged as an efficient way to adapt VLMs to downstream tasks. Yet, existing CoOp-based strategies fall short in performing class-specific prompts on unseen categories, limiting generalizability in fine-grained scenarios. To overcome these constraints, we introduce a novel prompt generation approach inspirited by text generation in natural language processing (NLP). Our method, named Pseudo-Prompt Generating (PsPG), capitalizes on the priori knowledge of multi-modal features. Featuring a RNN-based decoder, PsPG autoregressively generates class-tailored embedding vectors, i.e., pseudo-prompts. Comparative evaluations on various multi-label chest radiograph datasets affirm the superiority of our approach against leading medical vision-language and multi-label prompt learning methods.

Specifically, on BlindTest, our suite of 7 very simple tasks such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting circles in an Olympic-like logo, four state-of-the-art VLMs are only 58.57% accurate on average. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs the best at 74.94% accuracy, but this is still far from the human expected accuracy of 100%. Across different image resolutions and line widths, VLMs consistently struggle with tasks that require precise spatial information and recognizing geometric primitives that overlap or are close together.

However, most benchmarks conduct questions by selecting images from existing datasets, resulting in the potential data leakage. Besides, these benchmarks merely focus on evaluating LVLMs on the realistic style images and clean scenarios, leaving the multi-stylized images and noisy scenarios unexplored. In response to these challenges, we propose a dynamic and scalable benchmark named Dysca for evaluating LVLMs by leveraging synthesis images. Specifically, we leverage Stable Diffusion and design a rule-based method to dynamically generate novel images, questions and the corresponding answers. We consider 51 kinds of image styles and evaluate the perception capability in 20 subtasks. Moreover, we conduct evaluations under 4 scenarios (i.e., Clean, Corruption, Print Attacking and Adversarial Attacking) and 3 question types (i.e., Multi-choices, True-or-false and Free-form). Thanks to the generative paradigm, Dysca serves as a scalable benchmark for easily adding new subtasks and scenarios. A total of 8 advanced open-source LVLMs with 10 checkpoints are evaluated on Dysca, revealing the drawbacks of current LVLMs. The benchmark is released in \url{https://github.com/Benchmark-Dysca/Dysca}.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to handle rare objects, which fall into the long tail of data distributions, is less understood. To rigorously evaluate this aspect, we introduce the "Uncontextualized Uncommon Objects" (UOUO) benchmark. This benchmark focuses on systematically testing VLMs with both large and small parameter counts on rare and specialized objects. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that while smaller VLMs maintain competitive performance on common datasets, they significantly underperform on tasks involving uncommon objects. We also propose an advanced, scalable pipeline for data collection and cleaning, ensuring the UOUO benchmark provides high-quality, challenging instances. These findings highlight the need to consider long-tail distributions when assessing the true capabilities of VLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Assessing Brittleness of Image-Text Retrieval Benchmarks from Vision-Language Models Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15239v2)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-text retrieval (ITR), an important task in information retrieval (IR), is driven by pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) that consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, a significant challenge lies in the brittleness of existing ITR benchmarks. In standard datasets for the task, captions often provide broad summaries of scenes, neglecting detailed information about specific concepts. Additionally, the current evaluation setup assumes simplistic binary matches between images and texts and focuses on intra-modality rather than cross-modal relationships, which can lead to misinterpretations of model performance. Motivated by this gap, in this study, we focus on examining the brittleness of the ITR evaluation pipeline with a focus on concept granularity. We start by analyzing two common benchmarks, MS-COCO and Flickr30k, and compare them with their augmented versions, MS-COCO-FG and Flickr30k-FG, given a specified set of linguistic features capturing concept granularity. We discover that Flickr30k-FG and MS COCO-FG consistently achieve higher scores across all the selected features. To investigate the performance of VLMs on coarse and fine-grained datasets, we introduce a taxonomy of perturbations. We apply these perturbations to the selected datasets. We evaluate four state-of-the-art models - ALIGN, AltCLIP, CLIP, and GroupViT - on the standard and fine-grained datasets under zero-shot conditions, with and without the applied perturbations. The results demonstrate that although perturbations generally degrade model performance, the fine-grained datasets exhibit a smaller performance drop than their standard counterparts. Moreover, the relative performance drop across all setups is consistent across all models and datasets, indicating that the issue lies within the benchmarks. We conclude the paper by providing an agenda for improving ITR evaluation pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[$\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive Loss: Improving Contrastive Learning with Sample Similarity Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18134v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning good representations involves capturing the diverse ways in which data samples relate. Contrastive loss - an objective matching related samples - underlies methods from self-supervised to multimodal learning. Contrastive losses, however, can be viewed more broadly as modifying a similarity graph to indicate how samples should relate in the embedding space. This view reveals a shortcoming in contrastive learning: the similarity graph is binary, as only one sample is the related positive sample. Crucially, similarities \textit{across} samples are ignored. Based on this observation, we revise the standard contrastive loss to explicitly encode how a sample relates to others. We experiment with this new objective, called $\mathbb{X}$-Sample Contrastive, to train vision models based on similarities in class or text caption descriptions. Our study spans three scales: ImageNet-1k with 1 million, CC3M with 3 million, and CC12M with 12 million samples. The representations learned via our objective outperform both contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models trained on the same data across a range of tasks. When training on CC12M, we outperform CLIP by $0.6\%$ on both ImageNet and ImageNet Real. Our objective appears to work particularly well in lower-data regimes, with gains over CLIP of $16.8\%$ on ImageNet and $18.1\%$ on ImageNet Real when training with CC3M. Finally, our objective seems to encourage the model to learn representations that separate objects from their attributes and backgrounds, with gains of $3.3$-$5.6$\% over CLIP on ImageNet9. We hope the proposed solution takes a small step towards developing richer learning objectives for understanding sample relations in foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Inference of Vision Instruction-Following Models with Elastic Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18121v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

While these models enhance capabilities in natural language processing and visual interactive tasks, their growing adoption raises critical concerns regarding security and ethical alignment. This survey provides an extensive review of the emerging field of jailbreaking--deliberately circumventing the ethical and operational boundaries of LLMs and VLMs--and the consequent development of defense mechanisms. Our study categorizes jailbreaks into seven distinct types and elaborates on defense strategies that address these vulnerabilities. Through this comprehensive examination, we identify research gaps and propose directions for future studies to enhance the security frameworks of LLMs and VLMs. Our findings underscore the necessity for a unified perspective that integrates both jailbreak strategies and defensive solutions to foster a robust, secure, and reliable environment for the next generation of language models.

| **[EventBind: Learning a Unified Representation to Bind Them All for Event-based Open-world Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03135v6)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose EventBind, a novel and effective framework that unleashes the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) for event-based recognition to compensate for the lack of large-scale event-based datasets. In particular, due to the distinct modality gap with the image-text data and the lack of large-scale datasets, learning a common representation space for images, texts, and events is non-trivial.Intuitively, we need to address two key challenges: 1) how to generalize CLIP's visual encoder to event data while fully leveraging events' unique properties, e.g., sparsity and high temporal resolution; 2) how to effectively align the multi-modal embeddings, i.e., image, text, and events. Accordingly, we first introduce a novel event encoder that subtly models the temporal information from events and meanwhile, generates event prompts for modality bridging. We then design a text encoder that generates content prompts and utilizes hybrid text prompts to enhance EventBind's generalization ability across diverse datasets.With the proposed event encoder, text encoder, and image encoder, a novel Hierarchical Triple Contrastive Alignment (HTCA) module is introduced to jointly optimize the correlation and enable efficient knowledge transfer among the three modalities. We evaluate various settings, including fine-tuning and few-shot on three benchmarks, and our EventBind achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy compared with the previous methods, such as on N-Caltech101 (+5.34% and +1.70%) and N-Imagenet (+5.65% and +1.99%) with fine-tuning and 20-shot settings, respectively. Moreover, our EventBind can be flexibly extended to the event retrieval task using text or image queries, showing plausible performance.

In contrast, 3D-aware approaches that generate faces at different target poses require attribute-specific classifiers, learning separate model weights for each attribute, and are not scalable for novel attributes. In this work, we propose an efficient, plug-and-play, 3D-aware face editing framework based on attribute-specific prompt learning, enabling the generation of facial images with controllable attributes across various target poses. To this end, we introduce a text-driven learnable style token-based latent attribute editor (LAE). The LAE harnesses a pre-trained vision-language model to find text-guided attribute-specific editing direction in the latent space of any pre-trained 3D-aware GAN. It utilizes learnable style tokens and style mappers to learn and transform this editing direction to 3D latent space. To train LAE with multiple attributes, we use directional contrastive loss and style token loss. Furthermore, to ensure view consistency and identity preservation across different poses and attributes, we employ several 3D-aware identity and pose preservation losses. Our experiments show that our proposed framework generates high-quality images with 3D awareness and view consistency while maintaining attribute-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on different facial attributes, including hair color and style, expression, and others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV, 2024.

| **[Craft: Cross-modal Aligned Features Improve Robustness of Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15894v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt Tuning has emerged as a prominent research paradigm for adapting vision-language models to various downstream tasks. However, recent research indicates that prompt tuning methods often lead to overfitting due to limited training samples. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Aligned Feature Tuning (Craft) method to address this issue. Cross-modal alignment is conducted by first selecting anchors from the alternative domain and deriving relative representations of the embeddings for the selected anchors. Optimizing for a feature alignment loss over anchor-aligned text and image modalities creates a more unified text-image common space. Overfitting in prompt tuning also deteriorates model performance on out-of-distribution samples. To further improve the prompt model's robustness, we propose minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) over the anchor-aligned feature spaces to mitigate domain shift. The experiment on four different prompt tuning structures consistently shows the improvement of our method, with increases of up to $6.1\%$ in the Base-to-Novel generalization task, $5.8\%$ in the group robustness task, and $2.7\%$ in the out-of-distribution tasks.

Our approach includes a combination of vision-language models that segment the CT scans, which are then fed to a deep neural architecture, named RACNet, for Covid-19 detection. In particular, a novel framework, named SAM2CLIP2SAM, is introduced for segmentation that leverages the strengths of both Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to accurately segment the right and left lungs in CT scans, subsequently feeding these segmented outputs into RACNet for classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. At first, SAM produces multiple part-based segmentation masks for each slice in the CT scan; then CLIP selects only the masks that are associated with the regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., the right and left lungs; finally SAM is given these ROIs as prompts and generates the final segmentation mask for the lungs. Experiments are presented across two Covid-19 annotated databases which illustrate the improved performance obtained when our method has been used for segmentation of the CT scans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imperfect Vision Encoders: Efficient and Robust Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16526v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in visual question answering and image captioning, acting as a crucial link between visual and language models. However, existing open-source VLMs heavily rely on pretrained and frozen vision encoders (such as CLIP). Despite CLIP's robustness across diverse domains, it still exhibits non-negligible image understanding errors. These errors propagate to the VLM responses, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In our work, we propose an efficient and robust method for updating vision encoders within VLMs. Our approach selectively and locally updates encoders, leading to substantial performance improvements on data where previous mistakes occurred, while maintaining overall robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method during continual few-shot updates. Theoretical grounding, generality, and computational efficiency characterize our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending Our Privacy With Backdoors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08320v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information, such as names and faces of individuals, from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, by strategically inserting backdoors into text encoders, we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms-"a person" instead of the person's actual name. For image encoders, we map individuals' embeddings to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. The results of our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides a new "dual-use" perspective on backdoor attacks and presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Category-Extensible Out-of-Distribution Detection via Hierarchical Context Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16725v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The key to OOD detection has two aspects: generalized feature representation and precise category description. Recently, vision-language models such as CLIP provide significant advances in both two issues, but constructing precise category descriptions is still in its infancy due to the absence of unseen categories. This work introduces two hierarchical contexts, namely perceptual context and spurious context, to carefully describe the precise category boundary through automatic prompt tuning. Specifically, perceptual contexts perceive the inter-category difference (e.g., cats vs apples) for current classification tasks, while spurious contexts further identify spurious (similar but exactly not) OOD samples for every single category (e.g., cats vs panthers, apples vs peaches). The two contexts hierarchically construct the precise description for a certain category, which is, first roughly classifying a sample to the predicted category and then delicately identifying whether it is truly an ID sample or actually OOD. Moreover, the precise descriptions for those categories within the vision-language framework present a novel application: CATegory-EXtensible OOD detection (CATEX). One can efficiently extend the set of recognizable categories by simply merging the hierarchical contexts learned under different sub-task settings. And extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate CATEX's effectiveness, robustness, and category-extensibility. For instance, CATEX consistently surpasses the rivals by a large margin with several protocols on the challenging ImageNet-1K dataset. In addition, we offer new insights on how to efficiently scale up the prompt engineering in vision-language models to recognize thousands of object categories, as well as how to incorporate large language models (like GPT-3) to boost zero-shot applications. Code will be made public soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

We introduce Cross Anything System (CAS), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning module and a low-level control policy, enabling the robot to navigate across complex 3D terrains and reach the goal position. For high-level reasoning and motion planning, we propose a novel algorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task decomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level locomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method to train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous experiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate across complex 3D terrains, and its strong generalization ability ensures the applications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains.

| **[Efficient Generation of Targeted and Transferable Adversarial Examples for Vision-Language Models Via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10335v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks, particularly \textbf{targeted} transfer-based attacks, can be used to assess the adversarial robustness of large visual-language models (VLMs), allowing for a more thorough examination of potential security flaws before deployment. However, previous transfer-based adversarial attacks incur high costs due to high iteration counts and complex method structure. Furthermore, due to the unnaturalness of adversarial semantics, the generated adversarial examples have low transferability. These issues limit the utility of existing methods for assessing robustness. To address these issues, we propose AdvDiffVLM, which uses diffusion models to generate natural, unrestricted and targeted adversarial examples via score matching. Specifically, AdvDiffVLM uses Adaptive Ensemble Gradient Estimation to modify the score during the diffusion model's reverse generation process, ensuring that the produced adversarial examples have natural adversarial targeted semantics, which improves their transferability. Simultaneously, to improve the quality of adversarial examples, we use the GradCAM-guided Mask method to disperse adversarial semantics throughout the image rather than concentrating them in a single area. Finally, AdvDiffVLM embeds more target semantics into adversarial examples after multiple iterations. Experimental results show that our method generates adversarial examples 5x to 10x faster than state-of-the-art transfer-based adversarial attacks while maintaining higher quality adversarial examples. Furthermore, compared to previous transfer-based adversarial attacks, the adversarial examples generated by our method have better transferability. Notably, AdvDiffVLM can successfully attack a variety of commercial VLMs in a black-box environment, including GPT-4V.</p></details> |  |

A growing body of literature shows that PTLMs fail inconsistently and non-intuitively, demonstrating a lack of reasoning and grounding. To take a first step toward quantifying the effect of grounding (or lack thereof), we curate a novel and comprehensive dataset of object affordances -- Text2Afford, characterized by 15 affordance classes. Unlike affordance datasets collected in vision and language domains, we annotate in-the-wild sentences with objects and affordances. Experimental results reveal that PTLMs exhibit limited reasoning abilities when it comes to uncommon object affordances. We also observe that pre-trained VLMs do not necessarily capture object affordances effectively. Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances.

However, despite some early promising developments, the advancement of MoLM still trails significantly behind that of vision language models (VLM). This is because unique challenges exist apart from VLM in the field of MoLM due to 1) a limited amount of molecule-text paired data and 2) missing expertise that occurred due to the specialized areas of focus among the experts. To this end, we propose AMOLE, which 1) augments molecule-text pairs with structural similarity preserving loss, and 2) transfers the expertise between the molecules. Specifically, AMOLE enriches molecule-text pairs by sharing descriptions among structurally similar molecules with a novel structural similarity preserving loss. Moreover, we propose an expertise reconstruction loss to transfer knowledge from molecules that have extensive expertise to those with less expertise. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate the superiority of AMOLE in comprehending molecules and their descriptions, highlighting its potential for application in real-world drug discovery.

This paper introduces Test-Time Low-rank adaptation (TTL) as an alternative to prompt tuning for zero-shot generalization of large-scale VLMs. Taking inspiration from recent advancements in efficiently fine-tuning large language models, TTL offers a test-time parameter-efficient adaptation approach that updates the attention weights of the transformer encoder by maximizing prediction confidence. The self-supervised confidence maximization objective is specified using a weighted entropy loss that enforces consistency among predictions of augmented samples. TTL introduces only a small amount of trainable parameters for low-rank adapters in the model space while keeping the prompts and backbone frozen. Extensive experiments on a variety of natural distribution and cross-domain tasks show that TTL can outperform other techniques for test-time optimization of VLMs in strict zero-shot settings. Specifically, TTL outperforms test-time prompt tuning baselines with a significant improvement on average.

This study introduces AdaCLIP for the ZSAD task, leveraging a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), CLIP. AdaCLIP incorporates learnable prompts into CLIP and optimizes them through training on auxiliary annotated anomaly detection data. Two types of learnable prompts are proposed: static and dynamic. Static prompts are shared across all images, serving to preliminarily adapt CLIP for ZSAD. In contrast, dynamic prompts are generated for each test image, providing CLIP with dynamic adaptation capabilities. The combination of static and dynamic prompts is referred to as hybrid prompts, and yields enhanced ZSAD performance. Extensive experiments conducted across 14 real-world anomaly detection datasets from industrial and medical domains indicate that AdaCLIP outperforms other ZSAD methods and can generalize better to different categories and even domains. Finally, our analysis highlights the importance of diverse auxiliary data and optimized prompts for enhanced generalization capacity.

This led to the development of numerous prompting strategies to effectively fine-tune transformer-based models without succumbing to catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods struggle to specialize the model on domains significantly deviating from the pre-training and preserving its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Continual Generative training for Incremental prompt-Learning, a novel approach to mitigate forgetting while adapting a VLM, which exploits generative replay to align prompts to tasks. We also introduce a new metric to evaluate zero-shot capabilities within CL benchmarks. Through extensive experiments on different domains, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in adapting to new tasks while improving zero-shot capabilities.

Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into neural networks. However, a significant limitation in prior work is the assumption that human annotations for these concepts are readily available during training, necessitating continuous real-time input from human annotators. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL algorithms to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying humans to label a small set of data, or in the extreme case, without any human labels. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using a concept ensembles to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data with a simple strategy. We show how LICORICE reduces manual labeling efforts to to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments. Finally, we present an initial study to explore how we can use powerful vision-language models to infer concepts from raw visual inputs without explicit labels at minimal cost to performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Inspired by work highlighting the significance of the modality gap in contrastive dual-encoders, we propose the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM). Combining terms quantifying the similarity between image embeddings and the similarity between incorrect image and label embedding pairs, the IIMM functions as a strong predictor of performance changes with fine-tuning. Our extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, CoCa, EVA-02-CLIP) and five fine-tuning techniques (full fine-tuning, BitFit, attention-weight tuning, LoRA, CLIP-Adapter) demonstrates a strong, statistically significant linear relationship: fine-tuning on tasks with higher IIMM scores produces greater in-domain performance gains but also induces more severe out-of-domain performance degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods showing extreme forgetting. We compare our measure against transfer scores from state-of-the-art model selection methods and show that the IIMM is significantly more predictive of accuracy gains. With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to heuristically evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning. Given additional knowledge about the model's performance on a few diverse tasks, this heuristic further evolves into a strong predictor of expected performance changes when training for new tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite rapid progress in VLMs, resources for evaluating and addressing multimodal hallucination are limited and mostly focused on evaluation. This work introduces HaloQuest, a novel visual question answering dataset that captures various aspects of multimodal hallucination such as false premises, insufficient contexts, and visual challenges. A novel idea from HaloQuest is to leverage synthetic images, apart from real ones, to enable dataset creation at scale. With over 7.7K examples spanning across a wide variety of categories, HaloQuest was designed to be both a challenging benchmark for VLMs and a fine-tuning dataset for advancing multimodal reasoning. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with HaloQuest, with all open-source VLMs achieving below 36% accuracy. On the other hand, fine-tuning on HaloQuest significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving performance on standard reasoning tasks. Our results discover that benchmarking with generated images is highly correlated (r=0.97) with real images. Last but not least, we propose a novel Auto-Eval mechanism that is highly correlated with human raters (r=0.99) for evaluating VLMs. In sum, this work makes concrete strides towards understanding, evaluating, and mitigating hallucination in VLMs, serving as an important step towards more reliable multimodal AI systems in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a main conference paper at ECCV 2024 (https://github.com/google/haloquest)</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the reasons for such a lack of capability by performing an extensive bench-marking of compositional understanding in VLMs. We compare contrastive models with generative ones and analyze their differences in architecture, pre-training data, and training tasks and losses. Furthermore, we leverage In-Context Learning (ICL) as a way to improve the ability of VLMs to perform more complex reasoning and understanding given an image. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms baseline models across multiple compositional understanding datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional datasets focus on driver or vehicle behavior, often neglecting pedestrian perspectives. To fill this gap, we introduce the WTS dataset, highlighting detailed behaviors of both vehicles and pedestrians across over 1.2k video events in hundreds of traffic scenarios. WTS integrates diverse perspectives from vehicle ego and fixed overhead cameras in a vehicle-infrastructure cooperative environment, enriched with comprehensive textual descriptions and unique 3D Gaze data for a synchronized 2D/3D view, focusing on pedestrian analysis.

| **[When Do Universal Image Jailbreaks Transfer Between Vision-Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15211v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image "jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of "highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</p></details> |  |

Compositional visual reasoning approaches have emerged as effective strategies; however, they heavily rely on the commonsense knowledge encoded in Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform planning, reasoning, or both, without considering the effect of their decisions on the visual reasoning process, which can lead to errors or failed procedures. To address these challenges, we introduce HYDRA, a multi-stage dynamic compositional visual reasoning framework designed for reliable and incrementally progressive general reasoning. HYDRA integrates three essential modules: a planner, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent serving as a cognitive controller, and a reasoner. The planner and reasoner modules utilize an LLM to generate instruction samples and executable code from the selected instruction, respectively, while the RL agent dynamically interacts with these modules, making high-level decisions on selection of the best instruction sample given information from the historical state stored through a feedback loop. This adaptable design enables HYDRA to adjust its actions based on previous feedback received during the reasoning process, leading to more reliable reasoning outputs and ultimately enhancing its overall effectiveness. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various VR tasks on four different widely-used datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024.

Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval.

Specifically, we create captioning instruction prompts that rely on the target questions about the videos and leverage InstructBLIP to obtain video frame captions that are useful to the task at hand. Subsequently, we form descriptions of the whole video using the question-dependent frame captions, and feed that information, along with a question-answering prompt, to a large language model (LLM). The LLM is our reasoning module, and performs the final step of multiple-choice QA. Our simple Q-ViD framework achieves competitive or even higher performances than current state of the art models on a diverse range of videoQA benchmarks, including NExT-QA, STAR, How2QA, TVQA and IntentQA.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods for assessing debris accumulation involve labor-intensive and costly manual surveys. This study introduces a framework that utilizes aerial imagery captured by drones to conduct remote trash surveys. Leveraging computer vision techniques, our approach detects, classifies, and maps marine debris distributions. The framework uses Grounding DINO, a transformer-based zero-shot object detector, and CLIP, a vision-language model for zero-shot object classification, enabling the detection and classification of debris objects based on material type without the need for training labels. To mitigate over-counting due to different views of the same object, Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is employed for duplicate matching using local object features. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly web application that facilitates end-to-end analysis of drone images, including object detection, classification, and visualization on a map to support cleanup efforts. Our method achieves competitive performance in detection (0.69 mean IoU) and classification (0.74 F1 score) across seven debris object classes without labeled data, comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. This framework has the potential to streamline automated trash sampling surveys, fostering efficient and sustainable community-led cleanup initiatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, In Proceedings of the 7th ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies</p></details> |

Despite their potential, research in autonomous systems is hindered by the lack of datasets with annotated reasoning chains that explain the decision-making processes in driving. To bridge this gap, we present Reason2Drive, a benchmark dataset with over 600K video-text pairs, aimed at facilitating the study of interpretable reasoning in complex driving environments. We distinctly characterize the autonomous driving process as a sequential combination of perception, prediction, and reasoning steps, and the question-answer pairs are automatically collected from a diverse range of open-source outdoor driving datasets, including nuScenes, Waymo and ONCE. Moreover, we introduce a novel aggregated evaluation metric to assess chain-based reasoning performance in autonomous systems, addressing the semantic ambiguities of existing metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conduct experiments to assess various existing VLMs, revealing insights into their reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we develop an efficient approach to empower VLMs to leverage object-level perceptual elements in both feature extraction and prediction, further enhancing their reasoning accuracy. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

We report our findings during the training of the Falcon2-11B which follows a multi-stage approach where the early stages are distinguished by their context length and a final stage where we use a curated, high-quality dataset. Additionally, we report the effect of doubling the batch size mid-training and how training loss spikes are affected by the learning rate. The downstream performance of the foundation model is evaluated on established benchmarks, including multilingual and code datasets. The foundation model shows strong generalization across all the tasks which makes it suitable for downstream finetuning use cases. For the vision language model, we report the performance on several benchmarks and show that our model achieves a higher average score compared to open-source models of similar size.

Central to the reinforcement learning and planning for such robotic agents is a generalizable reward function. Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown remarkable performance in the domain of deep learning, paving the way for open-domain visual recognition. However, collecting data on robots executing various language instructions across multiple environments remains a challenge. This paper aims to transfer video-language models with robust generalization into a generalizable language-conditioned reward function, only utilizing robot video data from a minimal amount of tasks in a singular environment. Unlike common robotic datasets used for training reward functions, human video-language datasets rarely contain trivial failure videos. To enhance the model's ability to distinguish between successful and failed robot executions, we cluster failure video features to enable the model to identify patterns within. For each cluster, we integrate a newly trained failure prompt into the text encoder to represent the corresponding failure mode. Our language-conditioned reward function shows outstanding generalization to new environments and new instructions for robot planning and reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 camera-ready</p></details> |

LLMs are Visual Reasoning Coordinators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14834v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have introduced multiple vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrating impressive commonsense reasoning across various domains. Despite their individual capabilities, the potential of synergizing these complementary VLMs remains underexplored. The Cola Framework addresses this by showcasing how a large language model (LLM) can efficiently coordinate multiple VLMs through natural language communication, leveraging their distinct strengths. We have verified this claim on the challenging A-OKVQA dataset, confirming the effectiveness of such coordination. Building on this, our study investigates whether the same methodology can be applied to surveillance videos for action recognition. Specifically, we explore if leveraging the combined knowledge base of VLMs and LLM can effectively deduce actions from a video when presented with only a few selectively important frames and minimal temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM, when coordinating different VLMs, can successfully recognize patterns and deduce actions in various scenarios despite the weak temporal signals. However, our findings suggest that to enhance this approach as a viable alternative solution, integrating a stronger temporal signal and exposing the models to slightly more frames would be beneficial.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLMs,...</summary><p>LLMs, VLMs, Action Recognition</p></details> |

Despite the impressive ability to perform complex reasoning for VLMs, current models often struggle to effectively and precisely capture the compositional information on both the image and text sides. To address this, we propose FineMatch, a new aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching benchmark, focusing on text and image mismatch detection and correction. This benchmark introduces a novel task for boosting and evaluating the VLMs' compositionality for aspect-based fine-grained text and image matching. In this task, models are required to identify mismatched aspect phrases within a caption, determine the aspect's class, and propose corrections for an image-text pair that may contain between 0 and 3 mismatches. To evaluate the models' performance on this new task, we propose a new evaluation metric named ITM-IoU for which our experiments show a high correlation to human evaluation. In addition, we also provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of existing mainstream VLMs, including fully supervised learning and in-context learning settings. We have found that models trained on FineMatch demonstrate enhanced proficiency in detecting fine-grained text and image mismatches. Moreover, models (e.g., GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision) with strong abilities to perform multimodal in-context learning are not as skilled at fine-grained compositional image and text matching analysis. With FineMatch, we are able to build a system for text-to-image generation hallucination detection and correction.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, we propose a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, we improve video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Naturally, how to transfer the rich knowledge in such huge pre-trained models to downstream tasks and datasets becomes a hot topic. During downstream adaptation, the most challenging problems are overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, which can cause the model to overly focus on the current data and lose more crucial domain-general knowledge. Existing works use classic regularization techniques to solve the problems. As solutions become increasingly complex, the ever-growing storage and inference costs are also a significant problem that urgently needs to be addressed. While in this paper, we start from an observation that proper random noise can suppress overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. Then we regard quantization error as a kind of noise, and explore quantization for regularizing vision-language model, which is quite efficiency and effective. Furthermore, to improve the model's generalization capability while maintaining its specialization capacity at minimal cost, we deeply analyze the characteristics of the weight distribution in prompts, conclude several principles for quantization module design and follow such principles to create several competitive baselines. The proposed method is significantly efficient due to its inherent lightweight nature, making it possible to adapt on extremely resource-limited devices. Our method can be fruitfully integrated into many existing approaches like MaPLe, enhancing accuracy while reducing storage overhead, making it more powerful yet versatile. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets shows great superiority of our method sufficiently. Code is available at https://github.com/beyondhtx/QPrompt.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

Although powerful, our empirical results reveal that such models might not be able to identify fine-grained concepts. Specifically, the explanations of VLMs with respect to fine-grained concepts are entangled and mislocalized. To address this issue, we propose to DisEntAngle and Localize (DEAL) the concept-level explanations for VLMs without human annotations. The key idea is encouraging the concept-level explanations to be distinct while maintaining consistency with category-level explanations. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on a wide range of benchmark datasets and vision-language models. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the concept-level explanations of the model in terms of disentanglability and localizability. Surprisingly, the improved explainability alleviates the model's reliance on spurious correlations, which further benefits the prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2024</p></details> |

We answer this question with a clear no - VLMs introduce closed-set assumptions via their finite query set, making them vulnerable to open-set conditions. We systematically evaluate VLMs for open-set recognition and find they frequently misclassify objects not contained in their query set, leading to alarmingly low precision when tuned for high recall and vice versa. We show that naively increasing the size of the query set to contain more and more classes does not mitigate this problem, but instead causes diminishing task performance and open-set performance. We establish a revised definition of the open-set problem for the age of VLMs, define a new benchmark and evaluation protocol to facilitate standardised evaluation and research in this important area, and evaluate promising baseline approaches based on predictive uncertainty and dedicated negative embeddings on a range of open-vocabulary VLM classifiers and object detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, Accepted for publication in ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in: Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2024</p></details> |

Our method is a key component for language-assisted teleoperation and human-robot cooperation, where human operators can instruct the robots where to place their support contacts before whole-body reaching or manipulation using natural language. Words2Contact transforms the verbal instructions of a human operator into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections, until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and performance in contact prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot, instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.</p></details> |  |

These models use a single-layer ViT feature as a visual prompt, directly feeding it into the language models alongside textual tokens. However, when dealing with long sequences of visual signals or inputs such as videos, the self-attention mechanism of language models can lead to significant computational overhead. Additionally, using single-layer ViT features makes it challenging for large language models to perceive visual signals fully. This paper proposes an efficient multi-modal language model to minimize computational costs while enabling the model to perceive visual signals as comprehensively as possible. Our method primarily includes: (1) employing cross-attention to image-text interaction similar to Flamingo. (2) utilize hierarchical ViT features. (3) introduce the Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance model effectiveness. Our model achieves competitive scores on public multi-modal benchmarks and performs well in tasks such as image captioning and video captioning.</p></details> |  |

Although previous V-HOI detection models have made significant strides in accurate detection on specific datasets, they still lack the general reasoning ability like human beings to effectively induce HOI relationships. In this study, we propose V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR), a novel framework consisting of a series of plug-and-play modules that could facilitate the performance of current V-HOI detection models by leveraging the strong reasoning ability of different off-the-shelf pre-trained large language models (LLMs). We design a two-stage collaboration system of different LLMs for the V-HOI task. Specifically, in the first stage, we design a Cross-Agents Reasoning scheme to leverage the LLM conduct reasoning from different aspects. In the second stage, we perform Multi-LLMs Debate to get the final reasoning answer based on the different knowledge in different LLMs. Additionally, we devise an auxiliary training strategy that utilizes CLIP, a large vision-language model to enhance the base V-HOI models' discriminative ability to better cooperate with LLMs. We validate the superiority of our design by demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the prediction accuracy of the base V-HOI model via reasoning from multiple perspectives.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches primarily operate at a coarse-grained level without the detailed and semantic understanding of action concepts by exploiting fine-grained semantic connections between actions and body movements. To address this gap, we propose a contrastive video-language learning framework guided by a knowledge graph, termed KG-CLIP, which incorporates structured information into the CLIP model in the video domain. Specifically, we construct a multi-modal knowledge graph composed of multi-grained concepts by parsing actions based on compositional learning. By implementing a triplet encoder and deviation compensation to adaptively optimize the margin in the entity distance function, our model aims to improve alignment of entities in the knowledge graph to better suit complex relationship learning. This allows for enhanced video action recognition capabilities by accommodating nuanced associations between graph components. We comprehensively evaluate KG-CLIP on Kinetics-TPS, a large-scale action parsing dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to competitive baselines. Especially, our method excels at action recognition with few sample frames or limited training data, which exhibits excellent data utilization and learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, current vision-language models exhibit remarkable zero-shot prediction capabilities. In this work, we combine knowledge gained through UDA with the inherent knowledge of vision-language models. We introduce a strong-weak guidance learning scheme that employs zero-shot predictions to help align the source and target dataset. For the strong guidance, we expand the source dataset with the most confident samples of the target dataset. Additionally, we employ a knowledge distillation loss as weak guidance. The strong guidance uses hard labels but is only applied to the most confident predictions from the target dataset. Conversely, the weak guidance is employed to the whole dataset but uses soft labels. The weak guidance is implemented as a knowledge distillation loss with (shifted) zero-shot predictions. We show that our method complements and benefits from prompt adaptation techniques for vision-language models. We conduct experiments and ablation studies on three benchmarks (OfficeHome, VisDA, and DomainNet), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our ablation studies further demonstrate the contributions of different components of our algorithm.</p></details> |  |

However, these models lack the spatial understanding necessary for robotics applications where the agent must reason about the affordances provided by the 3D world around them. We present a system which trains on spatially-localized egocentric videos in order to connect visual input and task descriptions to predict a task's spatial affordance, that is the location where a person would go to accomplish the task. We show our approach outperforms the baseline of using a VLM to map similarity of a task's description over a set of location-tagged images. Our learning-based approach has less error both on predicting where a task may take place and on predicting what tasks are likely to happen at the current location. The resulting system enables robots to use egocentric sensing to navigate to physical locations of novel tasks specified in natural language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10920v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don't accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LLaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, Accepted as oral at Clinical NLP workshop at NAACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13442v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

Reasoning about physically-grounded affordances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13811v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For effective interactions with the open world, robots should understand how interactions with known and novel objects help them towards their goal. A key aspect of this understanding lies in detecting an object's affordances, which represent the potential effects that can be achieved by manipulating the object in various ways. Our approach leverages a dialogue of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to achieve open-world affordance detection. Given open-vocabulary descriptions of intended actions and effects, the useful objects in the environment are found. By grounding our system in the physical world, we account for the robot's embodiment and the intrinsic properties of the objects it encounters. In our experiments, we have shown that our method produces tailored outputs based on different embodiments or intended effects. The method was able to select a useful object from a set of distractors. Finetuning the VLM for physical properties improved overall performance. These results underline the importance of grounding the affordance search in the physical world, by taking into account robot embodiment and the physical properties of objects.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditional methods heavily rely on representation learning that is trained on a large amount of video data. However, a major challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining effective video representation. This difficulty stems from the complex and variable nature of human activities, which contrasts with the limited availability of data. In this study, we introduce PALM, an approach that tackles the task of long-term action anticipation, which aims to forecast forthcoming sequences of actions over an extended period. Our method PALM incorporates an action recognition model to track previous action sequences and a vision-language model to articulate relevant environmental details. By leveraging the context provided by these past events, we devise a prompting strategy for action anticipation using large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we implement maximal marginal relevance for example selection to facilitate in-context learning of the LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that PALM surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in the task of long-term action anticipation on the Ego4D benchmark. We further validate PALM on two additional benchmarks, affirming its capacity for generalization across intricate activities with different sets of taxonomies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affordance Perception by a Knowledge-Guided Vision-Language Model with Efficient Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13368v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robot platforms will increasingly be tasked with activities that involve grasping and manipulating objects in open world environments. Affordance understanding provides a robot with means to realise its goals and execute its tasks, e.g. to achieve autonomous navigation in unknown buildings where it has to find doors and ways to open these. In order to get actionable suggestions, robots need to be able to distinguish subtle differences between objects, as they may result in different action sequences: doorknobs require grasp and twist, while handlebars require grasp and push. In this paper, we improve affordance perception for a robot in an open-world setting. Our contribution is threefold: (1) We provide an affordance representation with precise, actionable affordances; (2) We connect this knowledge base to a foundational vision-language models (VLM) and prompt the VLM for a wider variety of new and unseen objects; (3) We apply a human-in-the-loop for corrections on the output of the VLM. The mix of affordance representation, image detection and a human-in-the-loop is effective for a robot to search for objects to achieve its goals. We have demonstrated this in a scenario of finding various doors and the many different ways to open them.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised fine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class names associated with ground truth labels. This paper explores a realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario, considering the presence of out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes within the unlabeled data. In particular, we focus on simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution detection and the recognition of instances associated with known classes. To tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages sample-level confidence to approximately minimize the conditional entropy of confident instances and maximize the marginal entropy of less confident instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompt, UEO incorporates optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of CLIP. Extensive experiments across 15 domains and 4 different types of prior knowledge validate the effectiveness of UEO compared to baseline methods. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/tim-learn/UEO}.</p></details> | ICML 2024 Highlight |

However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We demonstrate the proof of concept on Chest X-ray images, with extensive experimental validation across 6 distinct external datasets, encompassing 13 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pathology localization and classification, and even outperforms the human benchmark in locating 5 different pathologies. Additionally, we further verify its generalization ability by applying it to retinal fundus images. Our approach showcases AFLoc's versatilities and underscores its suitability for clinical diagnosis in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset's long-tail distribution significantly impacts LVLMs' understanding of visual relationships. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to disregard visual content and overly rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models. They also struggle with reasoning about spatial relationships based on contextual information.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2024; Project Page:https://github.com/mrwu-mac/R-Bench</p></details> |

Given a language command from a human, R+X first retrieves short video clips containing relevant behaviour, and then executes the skill by conditioning an in-context imitation learning method on this behaviour. By leveraging a Vision Language Model (VLM) for retrieval, R+X does not require any manual annotation of the videos, and by leveraging in-context learning for execution, robots can perform commanded skills immediately, without requiring a period of training on the retrieved videos. Experiments studying a range of everyday household tasks show that R+X succeeds at translating unlabelled human videos into robust robot skills, and that R+X outperforms several recent alternative methods.

While language and vision foundation models have achieved success in handling various open-vocabulary tasks with abundant training data, OV-3DDet faces a significant challenge due to the limited availability of training data. Although some pioneering efforts have integrated vision-language models (VLM) knowledge into OV-3DDet learning, the full potential of these foundational models has yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we unlock the textual and visual wisdom to tackle the open-vocabulary 3D detection task by leveraging the language and vision foundation models. We leverage a vision foundation model to provide image-wise guidance for discovering novel classes in 3D scenes. Specifically, we utilize a object detection vision foundation model to enable the zero-shot discovery of objects in images, which serves as the initial seeds and filtering guidance to identify novel 3D objects. Additionally, to align the 3D space with the powerful vision-language space, we introduce a hierarchical alignment approach, where the 3D feature space is aligned with the vision-language feature space using a pre-trained VLM at the instance, category, and scene levels. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and generalization, highlighting the potential of foundation models in advancing open-vocabulary 3D object detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |

The OpenIns3D framework employs a "Mask-Snap-Lookup" scheme. The "Mask" module learns class-agnostic mask proposals in 3D point clouds, the "Snap" module generates synthetic scene-level images at multiple scales and leverages 2D vision-language models to extract interesting objects, and the "Lookup" module searches through the outcomes of "Snap" to assign category names to the proposed masks. This approach, yet simple, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D open-vocabulary tasks, including recognition, object detection, and instance segmentation, on both indoor and outdoor datasets. Moreover, OpenIns3D facilitates effortless switching between different 2D detectors without requiring retraining. When integrated with powerful 2D open-world models, it achieves excellent results in scene understanding tasks.

In this paper, we carefully re-investigate the architecture of CLIP, and identify residual connections as the primary source of noise that degrades segmentation quality. With a comparative analysis of statistical properties in the residual connection and the attention output across different pretrained models, we discover that CLIP's image-text contrastive training paradigm emphasizes global features at the expense of local discriminability, leading to noisy segmentation results. In response, we propose ClearCLIP, a novel approach that decomposes CLIP's representations to enhance open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. We introduce three simple modifications to the final layer: removing the residual connection, implementing the self-self attention, and discarding the feed-forward network. ClearCLIP consistently generates clearer and more accurate segmentation maps and outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, affirming the significance of our discoveries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024. code available at https://github.com/mc- lan/ClearCLIP</p></details> |

While these models have shown unprecedented performance in many downstream zero-shot tasks (eg image captioning, question answers, etc), still little emphasis has been put on transferring one of the core LLM capability of In-Context Learning (ICL). ICL is the ability of a model to reason about a downstream task with a few examples demonstrations embedded in the prompt. In this work, through extensive evaluations, we find that the state-of-the-art VLMs somewhat lack the ability to follow ICL instructions. In particular, we discover that even models that underwent large-scale mixed modality pre-training and were implicitly guided to make use of interleaved image and text information (intended to consume helpful context from multiple images) under-perform when prompted with few-shot demonstrations (in an ICL way), likely due to their lack of direct ICL instruction tuning. To enhance the ICL abilities of the present VLM, we propose a simple yet surprisingly effective multi-turn curriculum-based learning methodology with effective data mixes, leading up to a significant 21.03% (and 11.3% on average) ICL performance boost over the strongest VLM baselines and a variety of ICL benchmarks. Furthermore, we also contribute new benchmarks for ICL evaluation in VLMs and discuss their advantages over the prior art.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting pre-trained VLMs to a sequence of downstream tasks often leads to the forgetting of previously learned knowledge and a reduction in zero-shot classification performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a unique Selective Dual-Teacher Knowledge Transfer framework that leverages the most recent fine-tuned and the original pre-trained VLMs as dual teachers to preserve the previously learned knowledge and zero-shot capabilities, respectively. With only access to an unlabeled reference dataset, our proposed framework performs a selective knowledge distillation mechanism by measuring the feature discrepancy from the dual-teacher VLMs. Consequently, our selective dual-teacher knowledge distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge while preserving the zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework is favorable against state-of-the-art continual learning approaches for preventing catastrophic forgetting and zero-shot degradation.

While recent approaches adapt VLMs to driving via single-round visual question answering (VQA), human drivers reason about decisions in multiple steps. Starting from the localization of key objects, humans estimate object interactions before taking actions. The key insight is that with our proposed task, Graph VQA, where we model graph-structured reasoning through perception, prediction and planning question-answer pairs, we obtain a suitable proxy task to mimic the human reasoning process. We instantiate datasets (DriveLM-Data) built upon nuScenes and CARLA, and propose a VLM-based baseline approach (DriveLM-Agent) for jointly performing Graph VQA and end-to-end driving. The experiments demonstrate that Graph VQA provides a simple, principled framework for reasoning about a driving scene, and DriveLM-Data provides a challenging benchmark for this task. Our DriveLM-Agent baseline performs end-to-end autonomous driving competitively in comparison to state-of-the-art driving-specific architectures. Notably, its benefits are pronounced when it is evaluated zero-shot on unseen objects or sensor configurations. We hope this work can be the starting point to shed new light on how to apply VLMs for autonomous driving.

Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning.

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

This study uses linear probing to shed light on the hidden knowledge at the output layers of LVLMs. We demonstrate that the logit distributions of the first tokens contain sufficient information to determine whether to respond to the instructions, including recognizing unanswerable visual questions, defending against jailbreaking attacks, and identifying deceptive questions. Such hidden knowledge is gradually lost in logits of subsequent tokens during response generation. Then, we illustrate a simple decoding strategy at the generation of the first token, effectively improving the generated content. In experiments, we find a few interesting insights: First, the CLIP model already contains a strong signal for solving these tasks, which indicates potential bias in the existing datasets. Second, we observe performance improvement by utilizing the first logit distributions on three additional tasks, including indicating uncertainty in math solving, mitigating hallucination, and image classification. Last, with the same training data, simply finetuning LVLMs improves models' performance but is still inferior to linear probing on these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

While prior research has primarily concentrated on improving the adversarial robustness of image encoders to guard against attacks on images, the exploration of text-based and multimodal attacks has largely been overlooked. In this work, we initiate the first known and comprehensive effort to study adapting vision-language models for adversarial robustness under the multimodal attack. Firstly, we introduce a multimodal attack strategy and investigate the impact of different attacks. We then propose a multimodal contrastive adversarial training loss, aligning the clean and adversarial text embeddings with the adversarial and clean visual features, to enhance the adversarial robustness of both image and text encoders of CLIP. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets across two tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adversarial robustness of CLIP. Interestingly, we find that the model fine-tuned against multimodal adversarial attacks exhibits greater robustness than its counterpart fine-tuned solely against image-based attacks, even in the context of image attacks, which may open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

However, these embeddings are vulnerable to subtle misalignment of cross-modal features, resulting in decreased model performance and diminished generalization. To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.</p></details> | Accepted by VIS 2024 |

Traditional 3D iterative-based reconstruction methods suffer from both slow speed and high memory consumption. Recently, in computer graphics, the differentiable rendering has made significant progress, particularly with the rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Inspired by these, we introduce differentiable radiation into PAI, developing a novel reconstruction algorithm: the Sliding Ball Adaptive Growth algorithm (SlingBAG) for 3D PAI, which shows ability in high-quality 3D PAI reconstruction both under extremely sparse view and limited view. We established the point cloud dataset in PAI, and used unique differentiable rapid radiator based on the spherical decomposition strategy and the randomly initialized point cloud adaptively optimized according to sparse sensor data. Each point undergoes updates in 3D coordinates, initial pressure, and resolution (denoted by the radius of ball). Points undergo adaptive growth during iterative process, including point destroying, splitting and duplicating along the gradient of their positions, manifesting the sliding ball effect. Finally, our point cloud to voxel grid shader renders the final reconstruction results. Simulation and in vivo experiments demonstrate that our SlingBAG reconstruction result's SNR can be more than 40 dB under extremely sparse view, while the SNR of traditional back-projection algorithm's result is less than 20 dB. Moreover, the result of SlingBAG's structural similarity to the ground truth is significantly higher, with an SSIM value of 95.6%. Notably, our differentiable rapid radiator can conduct forward PA simulation in homogeneous, non-viscous media substantially faster than current methods that numerically simulate the wave propagation, such as k-Wave. The dataset and all code will be open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited-View Photoacoustic Imaging Reconstruction Via High-quality Self-supervised Neural Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03663v1)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications within the human body, it is often challenging to fully encompass the target tissue or organ, necessitating the use of limited-view arrays, which can lead to the loss of crucial information. Addressing the reconstruction of photoacoustic sensor signals in limited-view detection spaces has become a focal point of current research. In this study, we introduce a self-supervised network termed HIgh-quality Self-supervised neural representation (HIS), which tackles the inverse problem of photoacoustic imaging to reconstruct high-quality photoacoustic images from sensor data acquired under limited viewpoints. We regard the desired reconstructed photoacoustic image as an implicit continuous function in 2D image space, viewing the pixels of the image as sparse discrete samples. The HIS's objective is to learn the continuous function from limited observations by utilizing a fully connected neural network combined with Fourier feature position encoding. By simply minimizing the error between the network's predicted sensor data and the actual sensor data, HIS is trained to represent the observed continuous model. The results indicate that the proposed HIS model offers superior image reconstruction quality compared to three commonly used methods for photoacoustic image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Segmentation and Image Reconstruction with Error Prediction in Photoacoustic Imaging using Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02653v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been used to improve photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction. One major challenge is that errors cannot be quantified to validate predictions when ground truth is unknown. Validation is key to quantitative applications, especially using limited-bandwidth ultrasonic linear detector arrays. Here, we propose a hybrid Bayesian convolutional neural network (Hybrid-BCNN) to jointly predict PA image and segmentation with error (uncertainty) predictions. Each output pixel represents a probability distribution where error can be quantified. The Hybrid-BCNN was trained with simulated PA data and applied to both simulations and experiments. Due to the sparsity of PA images, segmentation focuses Hybrid-BCNN on minimizing the loss function in regions with PA signals for better predictions. The results show that accurate PA segmentations and images are obtained, and error predictions are highly statistically correlated to actual errors. To leverage error predictions, confidence processing created PA images above a specific confidence level.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A study on the adequacy of common IQA measures for medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19224v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is standard practice in the development stage of novel machine learning algorithms that operate on images. The most commonly used IQA measures have been developed and tested for natural images, but not in the medical setting. Reported inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have different properties than natural images. In this study, we test the applicability of common IQA measures for medical image data by comparing their assessment to manually rated chest X-ray (5 experts) and photoacoustic image data (1 expert). Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical imaging: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our medical experiments are the full reference measures DISTS, FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM. Generally, the results on natural images yield considerably higher correlations, suggesting that the additional employment of tailored IQA measures for medical imaging algorithms is needed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of why we need to reassess full reference image quality assessment with medical images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19097v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) is not just indispensable in clinical practice to ensure high standards, but also in the development stage of novel algorithms that operate on medical images with reference data. This paper provides a structured and comprehensive collection of examples where the two most common full reference (FR) image quality measures prove to be unsuitable for the assessment of novel algorithms using different kinds of medical images, including real-world MRI, CT, OCT, X-Ray, digital pathology and photoacoustic imaging data. In particular, the FR-IQA measures PSNR and SSIM are known and tested for working successfully in many natural imaging tasks, but discrepancies in medical scenarios have been noted in the literature. Inconsistencies arising in medical images are not surprising, as they have very different properties than natural images which have not been targeted nor tested in the development of the mentioned measures, and therefore might imply wrong judgement of novel methods for medical images. Therefore, improvement is urgently needed in particular in this era of AI to increase explainability, reproducibility and generalizability in machine learning for medical imaging and beyond. On top of the pitfalls we will provide ideas for future research as well as suggesting guidelines for the usage of FR-IQA measures applied to medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPU-Based Parallel Computing Methods for Medical Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10928v1)** | 2024-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a rapid advancement in GPU technology, establishing it as a formidable high-performance parallel computing technology with superior floating-point computational capabilities compared to traditional CPUs. This paper explores the application of this technology in the field of photoacoustic imaging, an emerging non-destructive testing technique in biomedical engineering characterized by its high contrast, resolution, and penetration depth. We conduct a data parallelism analysis targeting the computationally intensive image reconstruction segment of photoacoustic imaging. By parallelizing the serial code for iterative reconstruction and optimizing memory access, we achieve significant improvements in processing speed. Our experiments compare the imaging speeds of vascular images reconstructed using CPUs and GPUs, with the results visualized using Matlab. The findings demonstrate that, while maintaining data accuracy, GPU parallel computing methods can markedly accelerate photoacoustic image reconstruction. This acceleration has the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of photoacoustic imaging in applications such as hemodynamic monitoring, clinical disease diagnosis, and drug development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamlined Photoacoustic Image Processing with Foundation Models: A Training-Free Solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07833v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have rapidly evolved and have achieved significant accomplishments in computer vision tasks. Specifically, the prompt mechanism conveniently allows users to integrate image prior information into the model, making it possible to apply models without any training. Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-informed and wavelength-flexible data-driven photoacoustic oximetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14863v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significance: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) promises to measure spatially-resolved blood oxygen saturation, but suffers from a lack of accurate and robust spectral unmixing methods to deliver on this promise. Accurate blood oxygenation estimation could have important clinical applications, from cancer detection to quantifying inflammation. Aim: This study addresses the inflexibility of existing data-driven methods for estimating blood oxygenation in PAI by introducing a recurrent neural network architecture. Approach: We created 25 simulated training dataset variations to assess neural network performance. We used a long short-term memory network to implement a wavelength-flexible network architecture and proposed the Jensen-Shannon divergence to predict the most suitable training dataset. Results: The network architecture can handle arbitrary input wavelengths and outperforms linear unmixing and the previously proposed learned spectral decolouring method. Small changes in the training data significantly affect the accuracy of our method, but we find that the Jensen-Shannon divergence correlates with the estimation error and is thus suitable for predicting the most appropriate training datasets for any given application. Conclusions: A flexible data-driven network architecture combined with the Jensen-Shannon Divergence to predict the best training data set provides a promising direction that might enable robust data-driven photoacoustic oximetry for clinical use cases.</p></details> | 37 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning-based sound speed estimation and aberration correction in linear-array photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11034v2)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic (PA) image reconstruction involves acoustic inversion that necessitates the specification of the speed of sound (SoS) within the medium of propagation. Due to the lack of information on the spatial distribution of the SoS within heterogeneous soft tissue, a homogeneous SoS distribution (such as 1540 m/s) is typically assumed in PA image reconstruction, similar to that of ultrasound (US) imaging. Failure to compensate the SoS variations leads to aberration artefacts, deteriorating the image quality. Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they usually involve complex hardware and/or time-consuming algorithms, hindering clinical translation. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework for SoS estimation and subsequent aberration correction in a dual-modal PA/US imaging system exploiting a clinical US probe. As the acquired PA and US images were inherently co-registered, the estimated SoS distribution from US channel data using a deep neural network was incorporated for accurate PA image reconstruction. The framework comprised an initial pre-training stage based on digital phantoms, which was further enhanced through transfer learning using physical phantom data and associated SoS maps obtained from measurements. This framework achieved a root mean square error of 10.2 m/s and 15.2 m/s for SoS estimation on digital and physical phantoms, respectively and structural similarity index measures of up to 0.86 for PA reconstructions as compared to the conventional approach of 0.69. A maximum of 1.2 times improvement in signal-to-noise ratio of PA images was further demonstrated with a human volunteer study. Our results show that the proposed framework could be valuable in various clinical and preclinical applications to enhance PA image reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speeding up Photoacoustic Imaging using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08834v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) integrates optical and acoustic imaging, offering enhanced penetration depth for detecting optical-absorbing components in tissues. Nonetheless, challenges arise in scanning large areas with high spatial resolution. With speed limitations imposed by laser pulse repetition rates, the potential role of computational methods is highlighted in accelerating PAM imaging. Purpose: We are proposing a novel and highly adaptable DiffPam algorithm that utilizes diffusion models for speeding up the photoacoustic imaging process. Method: We leveraged a diffusion model trained exclusively on natural images, comparing its performance with an in-domain trained U-Net model using a dataset focused on PAM images of mice brain microvasculature. Results: Our findings indicate that DiffPam achieves comparable performance to a dedicated U-Net model, without the need for a large dataset or training a deep learning model. The study also introduces the efficacy of shortened diffusion processes for reducing computing time without compromising accuracy. Conclusion: This study underscores the significance of DiffPam as a practical algorithm for reconstructing undersampled PAM images, particularly for researchers with limited AI expertise and computational resources.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Breaking the Resolution limit in Photoacoustic Imaging using Positivity and Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13952v1)** | 2023-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this tutorial, we aim to directly recreate some of our "aha" moments when exploring the impact of heat diffusion on the spatial resolution limit of photothermal imaging. Our objective is also to communicate how this physical limit can nevertheless be overcome and include some concrete technological applications. Describing diffusion as a random walk, one insight is that such a stochastic process involves not only a Gaussian spread of the mean values in space, with the variance proportional to the diffusion time, but also temporal and spatial fluctuations around these mean values. All these fluctuations strongly influence the image reconstruction immediately after the short heating pulse. The Gaussian spread of the mean values in space increases the entropy, while the fluctuations lead to a loss of information that blurs the reconstruction of the initial temperature distribution and can be described mathematically by a spatial convolution with a Gaussian thermal point-spread-function (PSF). The information loss turns out to be equal to the mean entropy increase and limits the spatial resolution proportional to the depth of the imaged subsurface structures. This principal resolution limit can only be overcome by including additional information such as sparsity or positivity. Prior information can be also included by using a deep neural network with a finite degrees of freedom and trained on a specific class of image examples for image reconstruction</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-based Generative Models for Photoacoustic Image Reconstruction with Rotation Consistency Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13843v1)** | 2023-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a newly emerged imaging modality which enables both high optical contrast and acoustic depth of penetration. Reconstructing images of photoacoustic tomography from limited amount of senser data is among one of the major challenges in photoacoustic imaging. Previous works based on deep learning were trained in supervised fashion, which directly map the input partially known sensor data to the ground truth reconstructed from full field of view. Recently, score-based generative models played an increasingly significant role in generative modeling. Leveraging this probabilistic model, we proposed Rotation Consistency Constrained Score-based Generative Model (RCC-SGM), which recovers the PAT images by iterative sampling between Langevin dynamics and a constraint term utilizing the rotation consistency between the images and the measurements. Our proposed method can generalize to different measurement processes (32.29 PSNR with 16 measurements under random sampling, whereas 28.50 for supervised counterpart), while supervised methods need to train on specific inverse mappings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arc-to-line frame registration method for ultrasound and photoacoustic image-guided intraoperative robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12590v1)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To achieve effective robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, the integration of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging system which is the most widely used imaging modelity in prostate imaging is essential. However, manual manipulation of the ultrasound transducer during the procedure will significantly interfere with the surgery. Therefore, we propose an image co-registration algorithm based on a photoacoustic marker method, where the ultrasound / photoacoustic (US/PA) images can be registered to the endoscopic camera images to ultimately enable the TRUS transducer to automatically track the surgical instrument Methods: An optimization-based algorithm is proposed to co-register the images from the two different imaging modalities. The principles of light propagation and an uncertainty in PM detection were assumed in this algorithm to improve the stability and accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is validated using the previously developed US/PA image-guided system with a da Vinci surgical robot. Results: The target-registration-error (TRE) is measured to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In both simulation and experimental demonstration, the proposed algorithm achieved a sub-centimeter accuracy which is acceptable in practical clinics. The result is also comparable with our previous approach, and the proposed method can be implemented with a normal white light stereo camera and doesn't require highly accurate localization of the PM. Conclusion: The proposed frame registration algorithm enabled a simple yet efficient integration of commercial US/PA imaging system into laparoscopic surgical setting by leveraging the characteristic properties of acoustic wave propagation and laser excitation, contributing to automated US/PA image-guided surgical intervention applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Moving beyond simulation: data-driven quantitative photoacoustic imaging using tissue-mimicking phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06748v1)** | 2023-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate measurement of optical absorption coefficients from photoacoustic imaging (PAI) data would enable direct mapping of molecular concentrations, providing vital clinical insight. The ill-posed nature of the problem of absorption coefficient recovery has prohibited PAI from achieving this goal in living systems due to the domain gap between simulation and experiment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a collection of experimentally well-characterised imaging phantoms and their digital twins. This first-of-a-kind phantom data set enables supervised training of a U-Net on experimental data for pixel-wise estimation of absorption coefficients. We show that training on simulated data results in artefacts and biases in the estimates, reinforcing the existence of a domain gap between simulation and experiment. Training on experimentally acquired data, however, yielded more accurate and robust estimates of optical absorption coefficients. We compare the results to fluence correction with a Monte Carlo model from reference optical properties of the materials, which yields a quantification error of approximately 20%. Application of the trained U-Nets to a blood flow phantom demonstrated spectral biases when training on simulated data, while application to a mouse model highlighted the ability of both learning-based approaches to recover the depth-dependent loss of signal intensity. We demonstrate that training on experimental phantoms can restore the correlation of signal amplitudes measured in depth. While the absolute quantification error remains high and further improvements are needed, our results highlight the promise of deep learning to advance quantitative PAI.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Photoacoustic image synthesis with generative adversarial networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15510v3)** | 2022-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties with high spatial resolution. However, previous attempts to solve the optical inverse problem with supervised machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains an unsolved challenge. We propose a novel approach to PAT image synthesis that involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. The former is achieved with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data. According to a validation study on a downstream task our approach yields more realistic synthetic images than the traditional model-based approach and could therefore become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT (qPAT).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, update with paper published at Photoacoustics</p></details> |

When imaging human subjects, geometric restrictions force limited-view data retrieval causing imaging artifacts. Iterative physical model based approaches reduce artifacts but require prohibitively time consuming PDE solves. Machine learning (ML) has accelerated PAI by combining physical models and learned networks. However, the depth and overall power of ML methods is limited by memory intensive training. We propose using invertible neural networks (INNs) to alleviate memory pressure. We demonstrate INNs can image 3D photoacoustic volumes in the setting of limited-view, noisy, and subsampled data. The frugal constant memory usage of INNs enables us to train an arbitrary depth of learned layers on a consumer GPU with 16GB RAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to PRML - Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference 2022</p></details> |

Clinical translation of the technology requires conversion of the high-dimensional acquired data into clinically relevant and interpretable information. In this work, we present a deep learning-based approach to semantic segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic images to facilitate image interpretability. Manually annotated photoacoustic {and ultrasound} imaging data are used as reference and enable the training of a deep learning-based segmentation algorithm in a supervised manner. Based on a validation study with experimentally acquired data from 16 healthy human volunteers, we show that automatic tissue segmentation can be used to create powerful analyses and visualizations of multispectral photoacoustic images. Due to the intuitive representation of high-dimensional information, such a preprocessing algorithm could be a valuable means to facilitate the clinical translation of photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They can lead to severe progressive muscle weakness, muscle degeneration, contracture, deformity and progressive disability. The NMDs evaluated in this study often manifest in early childhood. As subtypes of disease, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystropy (DMD) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), are difficult to differentiate at the beginning and worsen quickly, fast and reliable differential diagnosis is crucial. Photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging has shown great potential to visualize and quantify the extent of different diseases. The addition of automatic classification of such image data could further improve standard diagnostic procedures. We compare deep learning-based 2-class and 3-class classifiers based on VGG16 for differentiating healthy from diseased muscular tissue. This work shows promising results with high accuracies above 0.86 for the 3-class problem and can be used as a proof of concept for future approaches for earlier diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of NMDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by BVM conference proceedings 2022</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Adapted Acceleration for Limited-view Photoacoustic Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05194v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that detects the ultrasound signal generated from tissue with light excitation. Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) uses unfocused large-area light to illuminate the target with ultrasound transducer array for PA signal detection. Limited-view issue could cause a low-quality image in PACT due to the limitation of geometric condition. The model-based method is used to resolve this problem, which contains different regularization. To adapt fast and high-quality reconstruction of limited-view PA data, in this paper, a model-based method that combines the mathematical variational model with deep learning is proposed to speed up and regularize the unrolled procedure of reconstruction. A deep neural network is designed to adapt the step of the gradient updated term of data consistency in the gradient descent procedure, which can obtain a high-quality PA image only with a few iterations. Note that all parameters and priors are automatically learned during the offline training stage. In experiments, we show that this method outperforms the other methods with half-view (180 degrees) simulation and real data. The comparison of different model-based methods show that our proposed scheme has superior performances (over 0.05 for SSIM) with same iteration (3 times) steps. Furthermore, an unseen data is used to validate the generalization of different methods. Finally, we find that our method obtains superior results (0.94 value of SSIM for in vivo) with a high robustness and accelerated reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |

Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo-spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Photoacoustic Reconstruction Using Sparsity in Curvelet Frame: Image versus Data Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13080v2)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data. Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework. As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>06 Au...</summary><p>06 August 2021 (Accepted Version)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Factorization of the Wave Equation with Application to Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14747v2)** | 2021-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing a large number of spatial measurements enables high-resolution photoacoustic imaging without specific prior information. However, the acquisition of spatial measurements is time-consuming, costly, and technically challenging. By exploiting nonlinear prior information, compressed sensing techniques in combination with sophisticated reconstruction algorithms allow reducing the number of measurements while maintaining high spatial resolution. To this end, in this work we propose a multiscale factorization for the wave equation that decomposes the measured data into a low-frequency factor and sparse high-frequency factors. By extending the acoustic reciprocity principle, we transfer sparsity in the measurement domain into spatial sparsity of the initial pressure, which allows the use of sparse reconstruction techniques. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

| **[Technical Considerations when using Verasonics Research Ultrasound Platform for Developing a Photoacoustic Imaging System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06086v3)** | 2020-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging functional and molecular imaging technology that has attracted much attention in the past decade. Recently, many researchers have used the Vantage Verasonics research system for simultaneous ultrasound (US) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging. This was the motivation to write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and characterization using Verasonics platform. We describe the subtle details of US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its popularity and simple setup, as well as its high potential for clinical translatability. We have shown the sequencing of the US/PA signal generation, signal amplification, and related data processing protocols. A step-by-step guideline to develop and characterize PAI system using Vantage 128 has been presented. Some of the limitations of the vantage system are also listed. Photoacoustic imaging is a complement to the already established US imaging technique and may significantly increase its scope of application in diagnostic imaging and therapeutic monitoring. Combining with commercial medical US systems, the development of PAI can be accelerated by taking advantage of US image reconstruction and processing. With the information we presented in the body of this review and the four appendices, we described most of the experimental considerations one should know when working with the Vantage system for PAI tests.</p></details> | 43 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Invertible Neural Networks for Uncertainty Quantification in Photoacoustic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05110v2)** | 2020-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multispectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging modality which enables the recovery of functional tissue parameters such as blood oxygenation. However, the underlying inverse problems are potentially ill-posed, meaning that radically different tissue properties may - in theory - yield comparable measurements. In this work, we present a new approach for handling this specific type of uncertainty by leveraging the concept of conditional invertible neural networks (cINNs). Specifically, we propose going beyond commonly used point estimates for tissue oxygenation and converting single-pixel initial pressure spectra to the full posterior probability density. This way, the inherent ambiguity of a problem can be encoded with multiple modes in the output. Based on the presented architecture, we demonstrate two use cases which leverage this information to not only detect and quantify but also to compensate for uncertainties: (1) photoacoustic device design and (2) optimization of photoacoustic image acquisition. Our in silico studies demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to become an important building block for uncertainty-aware reconstruction of physiological parameters with PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to "Bildverarbeitung f\"ur die Medizin (BVM) 2021"</p></details> |
| **[Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04997v2)** | 2020-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as the vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field-of-view (FoV) provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods: In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern. This allows the transformation of a sequence of acquired PA images into one common global coordinate system and thus the consistent 3D reconstruction of PAT imaging data. Results: An initial feasibility study conducted with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data indicates that the Tattoo approach is well-suited for 3D reconstruction of PAT data with high accuracy and precision. Conclusion: In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Deep learning for biomedical photoacoustic imaging: A review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02744v1)** | 2020-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising emerging imaging modality that enables spatially resolved imaging of optical tissue properties up to several centimeters deep in tissue, creating the potential for numerous exciting clinical applications. However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 169 references</p></details> |
| **[Solvability for Photoacoustic Imaging with Idealized Piezoelectric Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09929v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reconstruction algorithms for photoacoustic imaging assume that the pressure field is measured by ultrasound sensors placed on a detection surface. However, such sensors do not measure pressure exactly due to their non-uniform directional and frequency responses, and resolution limitations. This is the case for piezoelectric sensors that are commonly employed for photoacoustic imaging. In this paper, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the basic constitutive relations for piezoelectricity, we propose a simple mathematical model for piezoelectric transducers. The approach simultaneously models how the pressure waves induce the piezoelectric measurements and how the presence of the sensors affects the pressure waves. Using this model, we analyze whether the data gathered by piezoelectric sensors leads to the mathematical solvability of the photoacoustic imaging problem. We conclude that this imaging problem is well-posed in certain normed spaces and under a geometric assumption. We also propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm that incorporates the model for piezoelectric measurements. A numerical implementation of the reconstruction algorithm is presented.</p></details> |  |

However, these sources also decrease image quality due to their low fluence. Here, we propose a denoising method using a multi-level wavelet-convolutional neural network to map low fluence illumination source images to its corresponding high fluence excitation map. Quantitative and qualitative results show a significant potential to remove the background noise and preserve the structures of target. Substantial improvements up to 2.20, 2.25, and 4.3-fold for PSNR, SSIM, and CNR metrics were observed, respectively. We also observed enhanced contrast (up to 1.76-fold) in an in vivo application using our proposed methods. We suggest that this tool can improve the value of such sources in photoacoustic imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Biomedical Optics Express journal</p></details> |
| **[Fluence compensation for real-time spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09572v1)** | 2020-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently we demonstrated an integrated photoacoustic (PA) and ultrasound (PAUS) system using a kHz-rate wavelength-tunable laser and a swept-beam delivery approach. It irradiates a medium using a narrow laser beam sweeping at high repetition rate over the desired imaging area, in contrast to the conventional PA approach using broad beam illumination at a low repetition. One significant advantage of this approach is that the fundamental problem of decoupling local light absorption at a point from optical fluence at the same point can be solved. Here, we present a fluence compensation method and demonstrate its performance in phantom studies. We adopted analytic fluence models, extending diffusion theory for the case of a pencil beam obliquely incident on a medium, and developed robust methods to estimate medium optical parameters using PA measurements acquired from multiple irradiation positions. We conducted comprehensive simulation tests and phantom studies using well-known contrast-agents to validate the reliability of the fluence models and spectral corrections.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Y-Net: A Hybrid Deep Learning Reconstruction Framework for Photoacoustic Imaging in vivo](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00975v1)** | 2019-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging non-invasive imaging modality combining the advantages of deep ultrasound penetration and high optical contrast. Image reconstruction is an essential topic in PAI, which is unfortunately an ill-posed problem due to the complex and unknown optical/acoustic parameters in tissue. Conventional algorithms used in PAI (e.g., delay-and-sum) provide a fast solution while many artifacts remain, especially for linear array probe with limited-view issue. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown state-of-the-art results in computer vision, and more and more work based on CNN has been studied in medical image processing recently. In this paper, we present a non-iterative scheme filling the gap between existing direct-processing and post-processing methods, and propose a new framework Y-Net: a CNN architecture to reconstruct the PA image by optimizing both raw data and beamformed images once. The network connected two encoders with one decoder path, which optimally utilizes more information from raw data and beamformed image. The results of the test set showed good performance compared with conventional reconstruction algorithms and other deep learning methods. Our method is also validated with experiments both in-vitro and in vivo, which still performs better than other existing methods. The proposed Y-Net architecture also has high potential in medical image reconstruction for other imaging modalities beyond PAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted the journal version</p></details> |
| **[Photoacoustic imaging beyond the acoustic diffraction-limit with dynamic speckle illumination and sparse joint support recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08278v2)** | 2019-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging the spatial resolution is inherently limited by the acoustic wavelength. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

We present Chemlactica and Chemma, two language models fine-tuned on a novel corpus of 110M molecules with computed properties, totaling 40B tokens. These models demonstrate strong performance in generating molecules with specified properties and predicting new molecular characteristics from limited samples. We introduce a novel optimization algorithm that leverages our language models to optimize molecules for arbitrary properties given limited access to a black box oracle. Our approach combines ideas from genetic algorithms, rejection sampling, and prompt optimization. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple molecular optimization benchmarks, including an 8% improvement on Practical Molecular Optimization compared to previous methods.

At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trust...</summary><p>TrustNLP@NAACL2024 (Fourth Workshop on Trustworthy Natural Language Processing)</p></details> |
| **[Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16370v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate the performance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | in submission |
| **[Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Two Great Steps that Work Better Together](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly taking the form of multi-stage pipelines involving multiple distinct language models (LMs) and prompting strategies. Here we address the question of how to fine-tune such systems to improve their performance. We cast this as a problem of optimizing the underlying LM weights and the prompting strategies together, and consider a challenging but highly realistic scenario in which we have no gold labels for any intermediate stages in the pipeline. To address this challenge, we evaluate approximate optimization strategies in which we bootstrap training labels for all pipeline stages and use these to optimize the pipeline's prompts and fine-tune its weights alternatingly. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification, we find that simple approaches for optimizing the prompts and weights together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 65% and 5%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks. We will release our new optimizers in DSPy at http://dspy.ai</p></details> |  |

However, no inquiry has yet been made on the impact of prompt selection on labelling accuracy. In this study, we show that performance greatly varies between prompts, and we apply the method of automatic prompt optimization to systematically craft high quality prompts. We also provide the community with a simple, browser-based implementation of the method at https://prompt-ultra.github.io/ .</p></details> |  |

While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks.

Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at the 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2024)</p></details> |

While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art.

We worked with the domain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and effective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a human-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset collection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By enhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative retrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool for HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments and evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome inconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, through expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such as G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10882v4)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wzongyu/POSI.</p></details> |  |

Results highlight GPT4 APO's superior performance in standardizing prompt quality across clinical note sections. A human-in-the-loop approach shows that experts maintain content quality post-APO, with a preference for their own modifications, suggesting the value of expert customization.

The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings)</p></details> |

The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Stance Detection: Understanding Public Perceptions in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15176v2)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of social media data has presented opportunities for accurately determining public and group-specific stances around policy proposals or controversial topics. In contrast with sentiment analysis which focuses on identifying prevailing emotions, stance detection identifies precise positions (i.e., supportive, opposing, neutral) relative to a well-defined topic, such as perceptions toward specific global health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional stance detection models, while effective within their specific domain (e.g., attitudes towards masking protocols during COVID-19), often lag in performance when applied to new domains and topics due to changes in data distribution. This limitation is compounded by the scarcity of domain-specific, labeled datasets, which are expensive and labor-intensive to create. A solution we present in this paper combines counterfactual data augmentation with contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of stance detection across domains and topics of interest. We evaluate the performance of current state-of-the-art stance detection models, including a prompt-optimized large language model, relative to our proposed framework succinctly called STANCE-C3 (domain-adaptive Cross-target STANCE detection via Contrastive learning and Counterfactual generation). Empirical evaluations demonstrate STANCE-C3's consistent improvements over the baseline models with respect to accuracy across domains and varying focal topics. Despite the increasing prevalence of general-purpose models such as generative AI, specialized models such as STANCE-C3 provide utility in safety-critical domains wherein precision is highly valued, especially when a nuanced understanding of the concerns of different population segments could result in crafting more impactful public policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364v3)** | 2024-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore, we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.</p></details> |  |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10584v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named "Concentration", which represents the "lookback" attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution. We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024, Preprint, Under review</p></details> |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

| **[Simultaneous Masking, Not Prompting Optimization: A Paradigm Shift in Fine-tuning LLMs for Simultaneous Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10443v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language processing tasks, motivating their adoption in simultaneous translation. Current fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs for simultaneous translation focus on prompting optimization strategies using either data augmentation or prompt structure modifications. However, these methods suffer from several issues, such as unnecessarily expanded training sets, computational inefficiency from dumping the key and value cache, increased prompt sizes, or restriction to a single decision policy. To eliminate these issues, in this work, we propose SimulMask, a new paradigm for fine-tuning LLMs for simultaneous translation. It utilizes a novel attention mask approach that models simultaneous translation during fine-tuning by masking attention for a desired decision policy. Applying the proposed SimulMask on a Falcon LLM for the IWSLT 2017 dataset, we have observed a significant translation quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art prompting optimization strategies on five language pairs while reducing the computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-free Prompted Based Anomaly Detection: prompt optimization with Meta-guiding prompt scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18197v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) are highly adaptable to various downstream tasks through few-shot learning, making prompt-based anomaly detection a promising approach. Traditional methods depend on human-crafted prompts that require prior knowledge of specific anomaly types. Our goal is to develop a human-free prompt-based anomaly detection framework that optimally learns prompts through data-driven methods, eliminating the need for human intervention. The primary challenge in this approach is the lack of anomalous samples during the training phase. Additionally, the Vision Transformer (ViT)-based image encoder in VLMs is not ideal for pixel-wise anomaly segmentation due to a locality feature mismatch between the original image and the output feature map. To tackle the first challenge, we have developed the Object-Attention Anomaly Generation Module (OAGM) to synthesize anomaly samples for training. Furthermore, our Meta-Guiding Prompt-Tuning Scheme (MPTS) iteratively adjusts the gradient-based optimization direction of learnable prompts to avoid overfitting to the synthesized anomalies. For the second challenge, we propose Locality-Aware Attention, which ensures that each local patch feature attends only to nearby patch features, preserving the locality features corresponding to their original locations. This framework allows for the optimal prompt embeddings by searching in the continuous latent space via backpropagation, free from human semantic constraints. Additionally, the modified locality-aware attention improves the precision of pixel-wise anomaly segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11000v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET), which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting, Chain of Thought, and Tree of Thoughts, APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts, resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.4% increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.8% increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.8%), these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall, this research represents a significant leap in AI development, presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Contrastive Decoding: Boosting Safety Alignment of Large Language Models via Opposite Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16743v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become a significant concern to ensure their safety and prevent harmful responses. While current safe-alignment methods based on instruction fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can effectively reduce harmful responses from LLMs, they often require high-quality datasets and heavy computational overhead during model training. Another way to align language models is to modify the logit of tokens in model outputs without heavy training. Recent studies have shown that contrastive decoding can enhance the performance of language models by reducing the likelihood of confused tokens. However, these methods require the manual selection of contrastive models or instruction templates. To this end, we propose Adversarial Contrastive Decoding (ACD), an optimization-based framework to generate two opposite system prompts for prompt-based contrastive decoding. ACD only needs to apply a lightweight prompt tuning on a rather small anchor dataset (< 3 min for each model) without training the target model. Experiments conducted on extensive models and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better safety performance than previous model training-free decoding methods without sacrificing its original generation ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace is the New AutoDiff -- Unlocking Efficient Optimization of Computational Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16218v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. We propose an end-to-end optimization framework, Trace, which treats the computational workflow of an AI system as a graph akin to neural networks, based on a generalization of back-propagation. Optimization of computational workflows often involves rich feedback (e.g. console output or user's responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, hyper-parameters, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). Moreover, its computation graph can change dynamically with the inputs and parameters. We frame a new mathematical setup of iterative optimization, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO), to capture and abstract these properties so as to design optimizers that work across many domains. In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. Trace is the tool to implement OPTO in practice. Trace has a Python interface that efficiently converts a computational workflow into an OPTO instance using a PyTorch-like interface. Using Trace, we develop a general-purpose LLM-based optimizer called OptoPrime that can effectively solve OPTO problems. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We believe that Trace, OptoPrime and the OPTO framework will enable the next generation of interactive agents that automatically adapt using various kinds of feedback.

| **[Prompt Optimization via Adversarial In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02614v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new method, Adversarial In-Context Learning (adv-ICL), to optimize prompt for in-context learning (ICL) by employing one LLM as a generator, another as a discriminator, and a third as a prompt modifier. As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Teach Better or Show Smarter? On Instructions and Exemplars in Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15708v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their performance is heavily reliant on effective prompt engineering. Automatic prompt optimization (APO) methods are designed to automate this and can be broadly categorized into those targeting instructions (instruction optimization, IO) vs. those targeting exemplars (exemplar selection, ES). Despite their shared objective, these have evolved rather independently, with IO recently receiving more research attention. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by comprehensively comparing the performance of representative IO and ES techniques, both isolation and combination, on a diverse set of challenging tasks. Our findings reveal that intelligently reusing model-generated input-output pairs obtained from evaluating prompts on the validation set as exemplars consistently improves performance over IO methods but is currently under-investigated. We also find that despite the recent focus on IO, how we select exemplars can outweigh how we optimize instructions, with ES strategies as simple as random search outperforming state-of-the-art IO methods with seed instructions without any optimization. Moreover, we observe synergy between ES and IO, with optimal combinations surpassing individual contributions. We conclude that studying exemplar selection as a standalone method and its optimal combination with instruction optimization remains a crucial aspect of APO and deserves greater consideration in future research, even in the era of highly capable instruction-following models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Prompt Optimization: Aligning Large Language Models without Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04155v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive success in various applications. However, these models are often not well aligned with human intents, which calls for additional treatments on them; that is, the alignment problem. To make LLMs better follow user instructions, existing alignment methods primarily focus on further training them. However, the extra training of LLMs is usually expensive in terms of GPU computing; even worse, some LLMs are not accessible for user-demanded training, such as GPTs. In this work, we take a different perspective -- Black-Box Prompt Optimization (BPO) -- to perform alignments. The idea is to optimize user prompts to suit LLMs' input understanding, so as to best realize users' intents without updating LLMs' parameters. BPO leverages human preferences to optimize prompts, thus making it superior to LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) as a prompt engineer. Moreover, BPO is model-agnostic, and the empirical results demonstrate that the BPO-aligned ChatGPT yields a 22% increase in the win rate against its original version and 10% for GPT-4. Notably, the BPO-aligned LLMs can outperform the same models aligned by PPO and DPO, and it also brings additional performance gains when combining BPO with PPO or DPO.

| **[APEER: Automatic Prompt Engineering Enhances Large Language Model Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14449v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced Information Retrieval (IR) across various modules, such as reranking. Despite impressive performance, current zero-shot relevance ranking with LLMs heavily relies on human prompt engineering. Existing automatic prompt engineering algorithms primarily focus on language modeling and classification tasks, leaving the domain of IR, particularly reranking, underexplored. Directly applying current prompt engineering algorithms to relevance ranking is challenging due to the integration of query and long passage pairs in the input, where the ranking complexity surpasses classification tasks. To reduce human effort and unlock the potential of prompt optimization in reranking, we introduce a novel automatic prompt engineering algorithm named APEER. APEER iteratively generates refined prompts through feedback and preference optimization. Extensive experiments with four LLMs and ten datasets demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of APEER over existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) manual prompts. Furthermore, we find that the prompts generated by APEER exhibit better transferability across diverse tasks and LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/APEER.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Phase Accelerated Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13443v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-free prompt optimization methods have made significant strides in enhancing the performance of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. However, existing approaches make light of the importance of high-quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions, thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light, we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual-phase approach which starts with generating high-quality initial prompts by adopting a well-designed meta-instruction to delve into task-specific information, and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level, leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.</p></details> |  |

The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation.</p></details> |  |

We study prompt optimization for LM programs, i.e. how to update these prompts to maximize a downstream metric without access to module-level labels or gradients. To make this tractable, we factorize our problem into optimizing the free-form instructions and few-shot demonstrations of every module and introduce several strategies to craft task-grounded instructions and navigate credit assignment across modules. Our strategies include (i) program- and data-aware techniques for proposing effective instructions, (ii) a stochastic mini-batch evaluation function for learning a surrogate model of our objective, and (iii) a meta-optimization procedure in which we refine how LMs construct proposals over time. Using these insights we develop MIPRO, a novel optimizer that outperforms baselines on five of six diverse LM programs using a best-in-class open-source model (Llama-3-8B), by as high as 12.9% accuracy.

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table (12 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST): Integrating Human Feedback and Heuristic-based Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08702v3)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PROMST that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

| **[FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11811v2)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and three testing models.

| **[Task Facet Learning: A Structured Approach to Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10504v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a task in the form of a basic description and its training examples, prompt optimization is the problem of synthesizing the given information into a text prompt for a large language model (LLM). Humans solve this problem by also considering the different facets that define a task (e.g., counter-examples, explanations, analogies) and including them in the prompt. However, it is unclear whether existing algorithmic approaches, based on iteratively editing a given prompt or automatically selecting a few in-context examples, can cover the multiple facets required to solve a complex task. In this work, we view prompt optimization as that of learning multiple facets of a task from a set of training examples. We identify and exploit structure in the prompt optimization problem -- first, we find that prompts can be broken down into loosely coupled semantic sections that have a relatively independent effect on the prompt's performance; second, we cluster the input space and use clustered batches so that the optimization procedure can learn the different facets of a task across batches. The resulting algorithm, UniPrompt, consists of a generative model to generate initial candidates for each prompt section; and a feedback mechanism that aggregates suggested edits from multiple mini-batches into a conceptual description for the section. Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets and a real-world task shows that prompts generated using UniPrompt obtain higher accuracy than human-tuned prompts and those from state-of-the-art methods. In particular, our algorithm can generate long, complex prompts that existing methods are unable to generate. Code for UniPrompt will be available at \url{https://aka.ms/uniprompt}.</p></details> |  |

Despite the proliferation of interactive systems developed to support prompt engineering for LLMs across various tasks, most have primarily focused on textual or visual inputs, thus neglecting the complex interplay between modalities within multimodal inputs. This oversight hinders the development of effective prompts that guide model multimodal reasoning processes by fully exploiting the rich context provided by multiple modalities. In this paper, we present POEM, a visual analytics system to facilitate efficient prompt engineering for enhancing the multimodal reasoning performance of LLMs. The system enables users to explore the interaction patterns across modalities at varying levels of detail for a comprehensive understanding of the multimodal knowledge elicited by various prompts. Through diverse recommendations of demonstration examples and instructional principles, POEM supports users in iteratively crafting and refining prompts to better align and enhance model knowledge with human insights. The effectiveness and efficiency of our system are validated through two case studies and interviews with experts.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Batch-Instructed Gradient for Prompt Evolution:Systematic Prompt Optimization for Enhanced Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08713v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images from user-provided prompts. Despite this, the quality of these images varies due to the models' sensitivity to human language nuances. With advancements in large language models, there are new opportunities to enhance prompt design for image generation tasks. Existing research primarily focuses on optimizing prompts for direct interaction, while less attention is given to scenarios involving intermediary agents, like the Stable Diffusion model. This study proposes a Multi-Agent framework to optimize input prompts for text-to-image generation models. Central to this framework is a prompt generation mechanism that refines initial queries using dynamic instructions, which evolve through iterative performance feedback. High-quality prompts are then fed into a state-of-the-art text-to-image model. A professional prompts database serves as a benchmark to guide the instruction modifier towards generating high-caliber prompts. A scoring system evaluates the generated images, and an LLM generates new instructions based on calculated gradients. This iterative process is managed by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and assessed using the Human Preference Score version 2 (HPS v2). Preliminary ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of various system components and suggest areas for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

Accommodated with this goal, we propose POS, a training-free Prompt Optimization Suite to boost text-to-video models. POS is motivated by two observations: (1) Video generation shows instability in terms of noise. Given the same text, different noises lead to videos that differ significantly in terms of both frame quality and temporal consistency. This observation implies that there exists an optimal noise matched to each textual input; To capture the potential noise, we propose an optimal noise approximator to approach the potential optimal noise. Particularly, the optimal noise approximator initially searches a video that closely relates to the text prompt and then inverts it into the noise space to serve as an improved noise prompt for the textual input. (2) Improving the text prompt via LLMs often causes semantic deviation. Many existing text-to-vision works have utilized LLMs to improve the text prompts for generation enhancement. However, existing methods often neglect the semantic alignment between the original text and the rewritten one. In response to this issue, we design a semantic-preserving rewriter to impose contraints in both rewritng and denoising phrases to preserve the semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our POS can improve the text-to-video models with a clear margin. The code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Prompt-Driven Safeguarding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18018v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prepending model inputs with safety prompts is a common practice for safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against queries with harmful intents. However, the underlying working mechanisms of safety prompts have not been unraveled yet, restricting the possibility of automatically optimizing them to improve LLM safety. In this work, we investigate how LLMs' behavior (i.e., complying with or refusing user queries) is affected by safety prompts from the perspective of model representation. We find that in the representation space, the input queries are typically moved by safety prompts in a "higher-refusal" direction, in which models become more prone to refusing to provide assistance, even when the queries are harmless. On the other hand, LLMs are naturally capable of distinguishing harmful and harmless queries without safety prompts. Inspired by these findings, we propose a method for safety prompt optimization, namely DRO (Directed Representation Optimization). Treating a safety prompt as continuous, trainable embeddings, DRO learns to move the queries' representations along or opposite the refusal direction, depending on their harmfulness. Experiments with eight LLMs on out-of-domain and jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that DRO remarkably improves the safeguarding performance of human-crafted safety prompts, without compromising the models' general performance.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09723v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows for Zero-Shot Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20252v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown great progress in responding to user questions, allowing for a multitude of diverse applications. Yet, the quality of LLM outputs heavily depends on the prompt design, where a good prompt might enable the LLM to answer a very challenging question correctly. Therefore, recent works have developed many strategies for improving the prompt, including both manual crafting and in-domain optimization. However, their efficacy in unrestricted scenarios remains questionable, as the former depends on human design for specific questions and the latter usually generalizes poorly to unseen scenarios. To address these problems, we give LLMs the freedom to design the best prompts according to themselves. Specifically, we include a hierarchy of LLMs, first constructing a prompt with precise instructions and accurate wording in a hierarchical manner, and then using this prompt to generate the final answer to the user query. We term this pipeline Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflow, or HMAW. In contrast with prior works, HMAW imposes no human restriction and requires no training, and is completely task-agnostic while capable of adjusting to the nuances of the underlying task. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments across multiple benchmarks, we verify that despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can create detailed and suitable prompts, further boosting the performance of current LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptWizard: Task-Aware Agent-driven Prompt Optimization Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18369v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |
| **[Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient via Probe Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01251v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical issue given their rapid progresses. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing adversarial prompts to break the aligned LLMs, but optimization of GCG is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 1 figure, 23 tables</p></details> |

However, restricted access to closed-source LLMs via APIs and the difficulty in collecting massive high-quality datasets pose obstacles to the development of large language models in education fields of various courses. Given these challenges, we propose CourseGPT-zh, a course-oriented education LLM that supports customization and low-cost deployment. To address the comprehensiveness and diversity requirements of course-specific corpora, we design a high-quality question-answering corpus distillation framework incorporating prompt optimization, which effectively mines textbook knowledge and enhances its diversity. Moreover, considering the alignment of LLM responses with user needs, a novel method for discrete prompt optimization based on LLM-as-Judge is introduced. During optimization, this framework leverages the LLM's ability to reflect on and exploit error feedback and patterns, allowing for prompts that meet user needs and preferences while saving response length. Lastly, we obtain CourseGPT-zh based on the open-source LLM using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our discrete prompt optimization framework effectively improves the response quality of ChatGPT, and CourseGPT-zh exhibits strong professional capabilities in specialized knowledge question-answering, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models.</p></details> |  |

However, a persistent challenge within this domain is the optimization of prompts to effectively convey abstract concepts into concrete objects. For example, text encoders can hardly express "peace", while can easily illustrate olive branches and white doves. This paper introduces a novel approach named Prompt Optimizer for Abstract Concepts (POAC) specifically designed to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models in interpreting and generating images from abstract concepts. We propose a Prompt Language Model (PLM), which is initialized from a pre-trained language model, and then fine-tuned with a curated dataset of abstract concept prompts. The dataset is created with GPT-4 to extend the abstract concept to a scene and concrete objects. Our framework employs a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based optimization strategy, focusing on the alignment between the generated images by a stable diffusion model and optimized prompts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed POAC significantly improves the accuracy and aesthetic quality of generated images, particularly in the description of abstract concepts and alignment with optimized prompts. We also present a comprehensive analysis of our model's performance across diffusion models under different settings, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing abstract concept representation.</p></details> | WWW 2024 Companion |

Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine-tune the model, some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt-based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model, raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt-based Fine-tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt-based learning paradigm. However, UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work, we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient-based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{LinkPrompt}$, as well as the transferability of UATs generated by $\textit{LinkPrompt}$ to open-sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API-accessed LLM GPT-3.5-turbo.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the delicate refinement of text prompts. Users assign weights or alter the injection time steps of certain words in the text prompts to improve the quality of generated images. However, the success of fine-control prompts depends on the accuracy of the text prompts and the careful selection of weights and time steps, which requires significant manual intervention. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}uto-\textbf{E}diting (PAE) method. Besides refining the original prompts for image generation, we further employ an online reinforcement learning strategy to explore the weights and injection time steps of each word, leading to the dynamic fine-control prompts. The reward function during training encourages the model to consider aesthetic score, semantic consistency, and user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively improves the original prompts, generating visually more appealing images while maintaining semantic alignment.

However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and time-consuming. Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization either lack flexibility or efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to automatically select the optimal prompt for a given input from a finite set of synthetic candidate prompts. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) clustering the training data and generating candidate prompts for each cluster using an LLM-based prompt generator; (2) synthesizing a dataset of input-prompt-output tuples for training a prompt evaluator to rank the prompts based on their relevance to the input; (3) using the prompt evaluator to select the best prompt for a new input at test time. Our approach balances prompt generality-specificity and eliminates the need for resource-intensive training and inference. It demonstrates competitive performance on zero-shot question-answering datasets: GSM8K, MultiArith, and AQuA.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Efficient Prompting Methods for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01077v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has become a mainstream paradigm for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific natural language processing tasks. While this approach opens the door to in-context learning of LLMs, it brings the additional computational burden of model inference and human effort of manual-designed prompts, particularly when using lengthy and complex prompts to guide and control the behavior of LLMs. As a result, the LLM field has seen a remarkable surge in efficient prompting methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods. At a high level, efficient prompting methods can broadly be categorized into two approaches: prompting with efficient computation and prompting with efficient design. The former involves various ways of compressing prompts, and the latter employs techniques for automatic prompt optimization. We present the basic concepts of prompting, review the advances for efficient prompting, and highlight future research directions.</p></details> |  |

We observe that our instruction-based prompts generate outputs with 23.7% higher overlap with training data compared to the baseline prefix-suffix measurements. Our findings show that (1) instruction-tuned models can expose pre-training data as much as their base-models, if not more so, (2) contexts other than the original training data can lead to leakage, and (3) using instructions proposed by other LLMs can open a new avenue of automated attacks that we should further study and explore.

Our work addresses the inherent limitations of conventional single-prompt learning methods that often lead to overfitting due to the inability to generalize across varying contexts in real-world videos. Recognizing the diversity of camera views, backgrounds, and objects in videos, we propose a multi-prompt learning framework enhanced with optimal transport. This design allows the model to learn a set of diverse prompts for each action, capturing general characteristics more effectively and distributing the representation to mitigate the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, by employing optimal transport theory, we efficiently align these prompts with action features, optimizing for a comprehensive representation that adapts to the multifaceted nature of video data. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in action localization accuracy and robustness in few-shot settings on the standard challenging datasets of THUMOS-14 and EpicKitchens100, highlighting the efficacy of our multi-prompt optimal transport approach in overcoming the challenges of conventional few-shot TAL methods.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17804v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

One approach is to treat these models as black boxes and use forward passes (Inference APIs) to interact with them. Current research focuses on adapting these black-box models to downstream tasks using gradient-free prompt optimization, but this often involves an expensive process of searching task-specific prompts. Therefore, we are motivated to study black-box language model adaptation without prompt search. Specifically, we introduce a label-enhanced cross-attention network called CrossTune, which models the semantic relatedness between the input text sequence and task-specific label descriptions. Its effectiveness is examined in the context of few-shot text classification. To improve the generalization of CrossTune, we utilize ChatGPT to generate additional training data through in-context learning. A switch mechanism is implemented to exclude low-quality ChatGPT-generated data. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art gradient-free black-box tuning method by 5.7% on average. Even without using ChatGPT-augmented data, CrossTune performs better or comparably than previous black-box tuning methods, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-Coling 2024</p></details> |
| **[BrightDreamer: Generic 3D Gaussian Generative Framework for Fast Text-to-3D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11273v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-3D synthesis has recently seen intriguing advances by combining the text-to-image models with 3D representation methods, e.g., Gaussian Splatting (GS), via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). However, a hurdle of existing methods is the low efficiency, per-prompt optimization for a single 3D object. Therefore, it is imperative for a paradigm shift from per-prompt optimization to one-stage generation for any unseen text prompts, which yet remains challenging. A hurdle is how to directly generate a set of millions of 3D Gaussians to represent a 3D object. This paper presents BrightDreamer, an end-to-end single-stage approach that can achieve generalizable and fast (77 ms) text-to-3D generation. Our key idea is to formulate the generation process as estimating the 3D deformation from an anchor shape with predefined positions. For this, we first propose a Text-guided Shape Deformation (TSD) network to predict the deformed shape and its new positions, used as the centers (one attribute) of 3D Gaussians. To estimate the other four attributes (i.e., scaling, rotation, opacity, and SH coefficient), we then design a novel Text-guided Triplane Generator (TTG) to generate a triplane representation for a 3D object. The center of each Gaussian enables us to transform the triplane feature into the four attributes. The generated 3D Gaussians can be finally rendered at 705 frames per second. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods. Also, BrightDreamer possesses a strong semantic understanding capability even for complex text prompts.

Existing methods follow two main paradigms to collect evidence: (1) The \textit{retrieve-then-read} paradigm retrieves pertinent documents from an external corpus; and (2) the \textit{generate-then-read} paradigm employs large language models (LLMs) to generate relevant documents. However, neither can fully address multifaceted requirements for evidence. To this end, we propose LLMQA, a generalized framework that formulates the ODQA process into three basic steps: query expansion, document selection, and answer generation, combining the superiority of both retrieval-based and generation-based evidence. Since LLMs exhibit their excellent capabilities to accomplish various tasks, we instruct LLMs to play multiple roles as generators, rerankers, and evaluators within our framework, integrating them to collaborate in the ODQA process. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt optimization algorithm to refine role-playing prompts and steer LLMs to produce higher-quality evidence and answers. Extensive experimental results on widely used benchmarks (NQ, WebQ, and TriviaQA) demonstrate that LLMQA achieves the best performance in terms of both answer accuracy and evidence quality, showcasing its potential for advancing ODQA research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>TheWe...</summary><p>TheWebConf 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, code repo: https://github.com/EthanLeo-LYX/LLMQA</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce ConstitutionalExperts, a method for learning a prompt consisting of constitutional principles (i.e. rules), given a training dataset. Unlike prior methods that optimize the prompt as a single entity, our method incrementally improves the prompt by surgically editing individual principles. We also show that we can improve overall performance by learning unique prompts for different semantic regions of the training data and using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to route inputs at inference time. We compare our method to other state of the art prompt-optimization techniques across six benchmark datasets. We also investigate whether MoE improves these other techniques. Our results suggest that ConstitutionalExperts outperforms other prompt optimization techniques by 10.9% (F1) and that mixture-of-experts improves all techniques, suggesting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query-Dependent Prompt Evaluation and Optimization with Offline Inverse RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06553v4)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we aim to enhance the arithmetic reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through zero-shot prompt optimization. We identify a previously overlooked objective of query dependency in such optimization and elucidate two ensuing challenges that impede the successful and economical design of prompt optimization techniques. One primary issue is the absence of an effective method to evaluate prompts during inference when the golden answer is unavailable. Concurrently, learning via interactions with the LLMs to navigate the expansive natural language prompting space proves to be resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce Prompt-OIRL, which harnesses offline inverse reinforcement learning to draw insights from offline prompting demonstration data. Such data exists as by-products when diverse prompts are benchmarked on open-accessible datasets. With Prompt-OIRL, the query-dependent prompt optimization objective is achieved by first learning an offline reward model. This model can evaluate any query-prompt pairs without accessing LLMs. Subsequently, a best-of-N strategy is deployed to recommend the optimal prompt. Our experimental evaluations across various LLM scales and arithmetic reasoning datasets underscore both the efficacy and economic viability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02993v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Connecting Large Language Models with Evolutionary Algorithms Yields Powerful Prompt Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08532v2)** | 2024-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various tasks, but they rely on carefully crafted prompts that often demand substantial human effort. To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating "positive thinking" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of "positive thinking" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best "positive thinking" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A User-Friendly Framework for Generating Model-Preferred Prompts in Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12760v1)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-designed prompts have demonstrated the potential to guide text-to-image models in generating amazing images. Although existing prompt engineering methods can provide high-level guidance, it is challenging for novice users to achieve the desired results by manually entering prompts due to a discrepancy between novice-user-input prompts and the model-preferred prompts. To bridge the distribution gap between user input behavior and model training datasets, we first construct a novel Coarse-Fine Granularity Prompts dataset (CFP) and propose a novel User-Friendly Fine-Grained Text Generation framework (UF-FGTG) for automated prompt optimization. For CFP, we construct a novel dataset for text-to-image tasks that combines coarse and fine-grained prompts to facilitate the development of automated prompt generation methods. For UF-FGTG, we propose a novel framework that automatically translates user-input prompts into model-preferred prompts. Specifically, we propose a prompt refiner that continually rewrites prompts to empower users to select results that align with their unique needs. Meanwhile, we integrate image-related loss functions from the text-to-image model into the training process of text generation to generate model-preferred prompts. Additionally, we propose an adaptive feature extraction module to ensure diversity in the generated results. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of generating more visually appealing and diverse images than previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5% across six quality and aesthetic metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11711v1)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RL-based techniques can be used to search for prompts that when fed into a target language model maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we adapt several techniques for multi-objective optimization to RL-based discrete prompt optimization -- two that consider volume of the Pareto reward surface, and another that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We conduct an empirical analysis of these methods on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize volume perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhaseEvo: Towards Unified In-Context Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11347v1)** | 2024-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crafting an ideal prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a challenging task that demands significant resources and expert human input. Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 26 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Rewrite Prompts for Personalized Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00152v2)** | 2024-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation has become a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW '24)</p></details> |
| **[Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03099v1)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/Eladlev/AutoPrompt}{here}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models Against Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13954v3)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) has demonstrated significant ability in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on the phrasing of the task prompt, leading to research on automatic prompt optimization using labeled task data. We reveal that these prompt optimization techniques are vulnerable to distribution shifts such as subpopulation shifts, which are common for LLMs in real-world scenarios such as customer reviews analysis. In this light, we propose a new problem of robust prompt optimization for LLMs against distribution shifts, which requires the prompt optimized over the labeled source group can simultaneously generalize to an unlabeled target group. To solve this problem, we propose Generalized Prompt Optimization framework, which incorporates the unlabeled data from the target group into prompt optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with significant performance improvement on the target group and comparable performance on the source group.</p></details> | EMNLP 2023 Main |
| **[GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02408v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02101v1)** | 2024-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new "Automatic Behavior Optimization" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructPix2NeRF: Instructed 3D Portrait Editing from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02826v2)** | 2024-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the success of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in 3D-aware portrait editing, a variety of works have achieved promising results regarding both quality and 3D consistency. However, these methods heavily rely on per-prompt optimization when handling natural language as editing instructions. Due to the lack of labeled human face 3D datasets and effective architectures, the area of human-instructed 3D-aware editing for open-world portraits in an end-to-end manner remains under-explored. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end diffusion-based framework termed InstructPix2NeRF, which enables instructed 3D-aware portrait editing from a single open-world image with human instructions. At its core lies a conditional latent 3D diffusion process that lifts 2D editing to 3D space by learning the correlation between the paired images' difference and the instructions via triplet data. With the help of our proposed token position randomization strategy, we could even achieve multi-semantic editing through one single pass with the portrait identity well-preserved. Besides, we further propose an identity consistency module that directly modulates the extracted identity signals into our diffusion process, which increases the multi-view 3D identity consistency. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and show its superiority against strong baselines quantitatively and qualitatively.

In contrast to existing text-to-3D methods that often entail time-consuming per-prompt optimization and commonly output representations other than polygonal meshes, AToM directly generates high-quality textured meshes in less than 1 second with around 10 times reduction in the training cost, and generalizes to unseen prompts. Our key idea is a novel triplane-based text-to-mesh architecture with a two-stage amortized optimization strategy that ensures stable training and enables scalability. Through extensive experiments on various prompt benchmarks, AToM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art amortized approaches with over 4 times higher accuracy (in DF415 dataset) and produces more distinguishable and higher-quality 3D outputs. AToM demonstrates strong generalizability, offering finegrained 3D assets for unseen interpolated prompts without further optimization during inference, unlike per-prompt solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages with appendix and references.

However, dreaming has not been successfully applied to language models because the input space is discrete. We extend Greedy Coordinate Gradient, a method from the language model adversarial attack literature, to design the Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) algorithm. EPO optimizes the input prompt to simultaneously maximize the Pareto frontier between a chosen internal feature and prompt fluency, enabling fluent dreaming for language models. We demonstrate dreaming with neurons, output logits and arbitrary directions in activation space. We measure the fluency of the resulting prompts and compare language model dreaming with max-activating dataset examples. Critically, fluent dreaming allows automatically exploring the behavior of model internals in reaction to mildly out-of-distribution prompts.

However, prior discrete prompt optimization methods require expert knowledge to design the base prompt set and identify high-quality prompts, which is costly, inefficient, and subjective. Meanwhile, existing continuous prompt optimization methods improve the performance by learning the ideal prompts through the gradient information of PLMs, whose high computational cost, and low readability and generalizability are often concerning. To address the research gap, we propose a Dialogue-comprised Policy-gradient-based Discrete Prompt Optimization ($DP_2O$) method. We first design a multi-round dialogue alignment strategy for readability prompt set generation based on GPT-4. Furthermore, we propose an efficient prompt screening metric to identify high-quality prompts with linear complexity. Finally, we construct a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on policy gradients to match the prompts to inputs optimally. By training a policy network with only 0.67% of the PLM parameter size on the tasks in the few-shot setting, $DP_2O$ outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 1.52% in accuracy on average on four open-source datasets. Moreover, subsequent experiments also demonstrate that $DP_2O$ has good universality, robustness, and generalization ability.</p></details> | AAAI 2024 Main Track |

Typically, they learn a very small scale of parameters for pre-trained models in a white-box formulation, which assumes model architectures to be known and parameters to be accessible. However, large models are often not open-source due to considerations of preventing abuse or commercial factors, hence posing a barrier to the deployment of white-box PEFT methods. To alleviate the dependence on model accessibility, we introduce collaborative black-box tuning (CBBT) for both textual prompt optimization and output feature adaptation for black-box models. Specifically, considering that the backpropagation gradients are blocked, we approximate the gradients of textual prompts by analyzing the predictions with perturbed prompts. Secondly, a lightweight adapter is deployed over the output feature of the inaccessible model, further facilitating the model adaptation process. Empowered with these designs, our CBBT is extensively evaluated on eleven downstream benchmarks and achieves remarkable improvements compared to existing black-box VL adaptation methods.

However, most Med-VLP models learn task-specific representations independently from scratch, thereby leading to great inflexibility when they work across multiple fine-tuning tasks. In this work, we propose UniDCP, a Unified medical vision-language model with Dynamic Cross-modal learnable Prompts, which can be plastically applied to multiple medical vision-language tasks. Specifically, we explicitly construct a unified framework to harmonize diverse inputs from multiple pretraining tasks by leveraging cross-modal prompts for unification, which accordingly can accommodate heterogeneous medical fine-tuning tasks. Furthermore, we conceive a dynamic cross-modal prompt optimizing strategy that optimizes the prompts within the shareable space for implicitly processing the shareable clinic knowledge. UniDCP is the first Med-VLP model capable of performing all 8 medical uni-modal and cross-modal tasks over 14 corresponding datasets, consistently yielding superior results over diverse state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, automating the generation of such expert-level prompts remains elusive. Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space. Inspired by human-like trial-and-error exploration, PromptAgent induces precise expert-level insights and in-depth instructions by reflecting on model errors and generating constructive error feedback. Such a novel framework allows the agent to iteratively examine intermediate prompts (states), refine them based on error feedbacks (actions), simulate future rewards, and search for high-reward paths leading to expert prompts. We apply PromptAgent to 12 tasks spanning three practical domains: BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), as well as domain-specific and general NLP tasks, showing it significantly outperforms strong Chain-of-Thought and recent prompt optimization baselines. Extensive analyses emphasize its capability to craft expert-level, detailed, and domain-insightful prompts with great efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 10 figures |

Traditional approaches, however, face limitations due to their presumption of a uniform number of intents across all sessions. This assumption overlooks the dynamic nature of user sessions, where the number and type of intentions can significantly vary. In addition, these methods typically operate in latent spaces, thus hinder the model's transparency.Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel ISR approach, utilizing the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). First, this approach begins by generating an initial prompt that guides LLMs to predict the next item in a session, based on the varied intents manifested in user sessions. Then, to refine this process, we introduce an innovative prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively self-reflects and adjusts prompts. Furthermore, our prompt selection module, built upon the LLMs' broad adaptability, swiftly selects the most optimized prompts across diverse domains. This new paradigm empowers LLMs to discern diverse user intents at a semantic level, leading to more accurate and interpretable session recommendations. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, marking a significant advancement in ISR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt2NeRF-PIL: Fast NeRF Generation via Pretrained Implicit Latent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02568v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores promptable NeRF generation (e.g., text prompt or single image prompt) for direct conditioning and fast generation of NeRF parameters for the underlying 3D scenes, thus undoing complex intermediate steps while providing full 3D generation with conditional control. Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.</p></details> |  |

A Survey on Factual Knowledge Probing in Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16570v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on vast unlabeled data, rich in world knowledge. This fact has sparked the interest of the community in quantifying the amount of factual knowledge present in PLMs, as this explains their performance on downstream tasks, and potentially justifies their use as knowledge bases. In this work, we survey methods and datasets that are used to probe PLMs for factual knowledge. Our contributions are: (1) We propose a categorization scheme for factual probing methods that is based on how their inputs, outputs and the probed PLMs are adapted; (2) We provide an overview of the datasets used for factual probing; (3) We synthesize insights about knowledge retention and prompt optimization in PLMs, analyze obstacles to adopting PLMs as knowledge bases and outline directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Findings 2023</p></details> |
| **[Joint Prompt Optimization of Stacked LLMs using Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12509v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can be seen as atomic units of computation mapping sequences to a distribution over sequences. Thus, they can be seen as stochastic language layers in a language network, where the learnable parameters are the natural language prompts at each layer. By stacking two such layers and feeding the output of one layer to the next, we obtain a Deep Language Network (DLN). We first show how to effectively perform prompt optimization for a 1-Layer language network (DLN-1). Then, we present an extension that applies to 2-layer DLNs (DLN-2), where two prompts must be learned. The key idea is to consider the output of the first layer as a latent variable, which requires inference, and prompts to be learned as the parameters of the generative distribution. We first test the effectiveness of DLN-1 in multiple reasoning and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we show that DLN-2 can reach higher performance than a single layer, showing promise that we might reach comparable performance to GPT-4, even when each LLM in the network is smaller and less powerful.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[A Bayesian approach for prompt optimization in pre-trained language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00471v1)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prompt is a sequence of symbol or tokens, selected from a vocabulary according to some rule, which is prepended/concatenated to a textual query. A key problem is how to select the sequence of tokens: in this paper we formulate it as a combinatorial optimization problem. The high dimensionality of the token space com-pounded by the length of the prompt sequence requires a very efficient solution. In this paper we propose a Bayesian optimization method, executed in a continuous em-bedding of the combinatorial space. In this paper we focus on hard prompt tuning (HPT) which directly searches for discrete tokens to be added to the text input with-out requiring access to the large language model (LLM) and can be used also when LLM is available only as a black-box. This is critically important if LLMs are made available in the Model as a Service (MaaS) manner as in GPT-4. The current manu-script is focused on the optimization of discrete prompts for classification tasks. The discrete prompts give rise to difficult combinatorial optimization problem which easily become intractable given the dimension of the token space in realistic applications. The optimization method considered in this paper is Bayesian optimization (BO) which has become the dominant approach in black-box optimization for its sample efficiency along with its modular structure and versatility. In this paper we use BoTorch, a library for Bayesian optimization research built on top of pyTorch. Albeit preliminary and obtained using a 'vanilla' version of BO, the experiments on RoB-ERTa on six benchmarks, show a good performance across a variety of tasks and enable an analysis of the tradeoff between size of the search space, accuracy and wall clock time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Mobile-Edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX) Services by Prompt Engineering: Fundamental, Framework, and Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01065v2)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the next-generation paradigm for content creation, AI-Generated Content (AIGC), i.e., generating content automatically by Generative AI (GAI) based on user prompts, has gained great attention and success recently. With the ever-increasing power of GAI, especially the emergence of Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) that contain billions of parameters and prompt engineering methods (i.e., finding the best prompts for the given task), the application range of AIGC is rapidly expanding, covering various forms of information for human, systems, and networks, such as network designs, channel coding, and optimization solutions. In this article, we present the concept of mobile-edge AI-Generated Everything (AIGX). Specifically, we first review the building blocks of AIGX, the evolution from AIGC to AIGX, as well as practical AIGX applications. Then, we present a unified mobile-edge AIGX framework, which employs edge devices to provide PFM-empowered AIGX services and optimizes such services via prompt engineering. More importantly, we demonstrate that suboptimal prompts lead to poor generation quality, which adversely affects user satisfaction, edge network performance, and resource utilization. Accordingly, we conduct a case study, showcasing how to train an effective prompt optimizer using ChatGPT and investigating how much improvement is possible with prompt engineering in terms of user experience, quality of generation, and network performance.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figure |
| **[Read-only Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14960v2)** | 2023-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre-trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance variance and generalization, especially in data-deficient settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO leverages masked attention to prevent the internal representation shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are initialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outperforms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robustness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generalization on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/RPO.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2023 |
| **[Task-driven Prompt Evolution for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17128v1)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Promptable foundation models, particularly Segment Anything Model (SAM), have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional task-specific supervised learning for image segmentation. However, many evaluation studies have found that their performance on medical imaging modalities to be underwhelming compared to conventional deep learning methods. In the world of large pre-trained language and vision-language models, learning prompt from downstream tasks has achieved considerable success in improving performance. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Prompt Optimization Technique for foundation models like SAM (SAMPOT) that utilizes the downstream segmentation task to optimize the human-provided prompt to obtain improved performance. We demonstrate the utility of SAMPOT on lung segmentation in chest X-ray images and obtain an improvement on a significant number of cases ($\sim75\%$) over human-provided initial prompts. We hope this work will lead to further investigations in the nascent field of automatic visual prompt-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiPrompter: Cooperative Prompt Optimization with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16730v1)** | 2023-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in automated prompt optimization based on reinforcement learning (RL). This approach offers important advantages, such as generating interpretable prompts and being compatible with black-box foundation models. However, the substantial prompt space size poses challenges for RL-based methods, often leading to suboptimal policy convergence. This paper introduces MultiPrompter, a new framework that views prompt optimization as a cooperative game between prompters which take turns composing a prompt together. Our cooperative prompt optimization effectively reduces the problem size and helps prompters learn optimal prompts. We test our method on the text-to-image task and show its ability to generate higher-quality images than baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unnatural language processing: How do language models handle machine-generated prompts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15829v1)** | 2023-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language model prompt optimization research has shown that semantically and grammatically well-formed manually crafted prompts are routinely outperformed by automatically generated token sequences with no apparent meaning or syntactic structure, including sequences of vectors from a model's embedding space. We use machine-generated prompts to probe how models respond to input that is not composed of natural language expressions. We study the behavior of models of different sizes in multiple semantic tasks in response to both continuous and discrete machine-generated prompts, and compare it to the behavior in response to human-generated natural-language prompts. Even when producing a similar output, machine-generated and human prompts trigger different response patterns through the network processing pathways, including different perplexities, different attention and output entropy distributions, and different unit activation profiles. We provide preliminary insight into the nature of the units activated by different prompt types, suggesting that only natural language prompts recruit a genuinely linguistic circuit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2023 Camera-Ready</p></details> |
